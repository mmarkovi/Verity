# top 10 words appeared in False articles (display a percentage of the word bank) DONE
# top 10 words appeared in True articles (display a percentage of the word bank) DONE
# top 10 words that appear in the True article and not appear in False article DONE
# top 10 words that appear in the False article and not appear in True article DONE
# Find the word with the most and least frequency DONE
# Find the True-to-False ratio on Nan title and NaN text (for finding whether removing them can cause a significant bias)

# preprocessing

# second dataset: convert the truthfulness into binary variable
# remove the data entry with NaN text and NaN title
# combine the text and title as a single feature
# lemmatization
# try to get the whole number (e.g. 100,000 is counted as "100,000" instead of "100","000")
# trigram (for future implementation)
# separate the sources into names type and url types (for future implementation)

# UI/UX
# Figma for prototype (home page, about page)
# Vue init file structure
# user study with people you know (for future implementation)
# user study to find how better humans can classify the false information than the model

# fix the counting method in preprocessing
# begin building a model (simple neural network) (make several models with different params)
# save the model using pickle
# make simple cross validation
# work on the web prototype
