      "The breakdown of the global liberal world order and its foundations. What is happening now is a global breakdown of the world order. It does not matter at all whether the nature of the coronavirus is artificial or not, nor is it even of principal importance whether, if it is artificial, it was deliberately released by the “world government” or not. The epidemic has begun - it is a fact. Now the main thing is to trace how the \"world government\" has reacted to it.To clarify, the \"world government\" is the totality of global political and economic elites and the intellectuals and media (mediacrats) that serve them. Such a \"world government\" necessarily exists, because on a global scale there are strictly-defined, fundamental norms that determine the basic parameters of politics, economics and ideology.In the economy, the only recognized norm is capitalism, the market economy (which is disputed only by North Korea - not, and this is very important, by China, which presents its own version of national state capitalism under the management of the Communist Party).In politics the only recognized norm is parliamentary liberal democracy, based on civil society being the subject and source of legality and legitimacy (besides North Korea, almost everyone is in agreement with this, although China interprets \"civil society\" in a special socialist and partly national-cultural optic and carries out mediacratic screening by means other than direct parliamentary elections; and some Islamic states - for example, Iran and the Gulf monarchies - have a number of special features. In ideology, everyone agrees with the arrangement that any individual has a number of inalienable rights (to life, freedom of conscience, freedom of movement, etc.) which all states and societies are obliged to guarantee.In essence, these are the three basic principles of the global world that emerged after the collapse. of the USSR and the victory of the capitalist West in the Cold War. The main players in politics, economics and ideology are concentrated in Western countries, which set the model for others. This is the core of the \"world government\". Inside this government, China is beginning to play an increasingly important role, towards which the elite of Russia and all other states are rushing.\n",
      "Whether the coronavirus is artificial is not so important. It does not matter whether the coronavirus was produced artificially and deliberately used by the \"world government\" in this sense.But it is this world, under the umbrella of such a \"world government” with all three of its axiomatic foundations, that is collapsing before our very eyes. This is reminiscent of the end of the socialist camp, the bipolar world and the USSR, but then one of two worlds disappeared, while one remained and extended its rules to all others including its yesterday's opponents. Gorbachev himself wanted to get into the \"world government\" without dissolving the USSR, but he was not accepted. Nor were the pro-Western leaders of the Russian Federation who surrendered to the West accepted. They still are not. And now, today, this very \"world government\" is collapsing. Could it have voluntarily opted for liquidation? Hardly. But it reacted to the coronavirus as if to something inevitable, and this was a choice.There was freedom on whether or not to recognize the coronavirus as existing. And by the very fact of its recognition of the pandemic, the \"world government\" signed its own death sentence. Did it do so consciously? No more (or no less) consciously than Gorbachev in Perestroika. In the case of the USSR, one pole disappeared, while the other remained. Today the end of planetary liberal democracy means the end of everything. This system has no other paradigm - except for North Korea (which is still a pure anachronism, albeit a very interesting one) or China’s compromised version.Who should have defeated the coronavirus and how?The coronavirus has already struck a blow from which neither politics, economics, nor ideology will recover. The pandemic would have to have been dealt with by the existing institutions, in normal mode without changing the basic rules neither in politics (meaning no quarantine, no forced isolation, let alone a state of emergency);nor in the economy (no remote work, no stopping of production, exchanges and financial- industrial institutions or trading platforms, no vacation, etc.);nor in ideology (no restrictions, albeit temporary on essential civil rights, freedom of movement, the cancellation or postponement of elections, referenda, etc.).but all of this has already happened on a global scale, including in Western countries, i.e., in the territory of the \"world government\" itself. The very foundations of the global system have been suspended.This is how we see the ongoing situation. For the \"world government\" to take such a step, it had to be forced to do so. By whom? After all, there simply cannot be any higher instance of authority than modern materialistic, atheistic and rationalistic humanity.\n",
      "Liberalism as the final result of New Time. Let us postpone this question for later and now look at the larger historical trajectory of the modern liberal-democratic global system, that is, the government of the \"liberal political elites\" (parliamentarism), major economic players (oligarchs and transnational monopolies), the ideologists of the \"open society\" and the journalists who serve them (including moderators of sentiments on social networks and the Internet). The source of this system should be sought in the end of the Renaissance and in the “New Time” (early Modernity) that emerged therefrom, which saw a fundamental break with the Middle Ages with regard to the subject of power and, consequently, to its very nature. In the Middle Ages and in the society of Tradition overall, the legitimacy and legality of the political model of society were based on the transcendent - superhuman, divine - factor. The supreme subject of power and law was God, His revelations and the laws and settings established by Him, as well as those institutions which were considered to be his representatives on Earth: in the Christian world, these were the Church and the monarchical state. The New Time of Modernity abolished this vertical and set itself the goal of building a society on earthly foundations. Thus the main subject and source of legitimacy and legality became man, and the \"celestial government\" - the \"supra-world government\" - gave way to the \"earthly government\". Politics, economy and ideology changed accordingly: democracy,capitalism and civil society emerged.For several centuries, these principles fought against the old (medieval) order until the last empires - the Russian, Ottoman, Austrian and German - fell in the 20th century. However, liberal democracy still had to cope with such heretical (from the liberal point of view) versions of Modernity as communism and fascism, which in their own ways interpreted \"civil society” and the human being as such: the former in class optics and the latter in national or racial terms. In 1945, the Communists and Liberals jointly ended fascism, and in 1991 the Communists fell. The liberals were the only ones left, and henceforth the \"world government\" turned from a plan into nearly a reality, as all countries and societies have recognized the standards of democracy, the market, and human rights. This is what Francis Fukuyama meant in his book The End of History and the Last Man. The history of this New Time began when the goal was set to replace the celestial subject with the earthly one, and it ended when this replacement was accomplished on a global scale.The end of the liberal world and its parallels with the end of the USSR. Today, instead of the end of history, that is, instead of the total triumph of liberal democracy, world capitalism and the ideology of the \"open society\" (rights of the human as an individual), we have collapsed into completely new conditions overnight. This is as unexpected as the end of the USSR. Even after 1991, many people could not believe that the Soviet system had disappeared, and some cannot even realize it now. Of course, the end of globalism was sensed by some critical thinkers: it was spoken of by conservatives, and the sharp rise of China, which represents a special model of globalism, Putin's refusal to cede power to the manipulable and controllable (as the West thought) Medvedev in 2012, and perhaps most importantly, Brexit and the rise of populism, could all be considered clear signs that, despite its proximity to the final point, globalism has not only been unable to effectively achieve the “end of history”, but is beginning to paradoxically move away from it. On a philosophical level, the postmodernists began to reflect on this, loudly proclaiming that something was wrong with Modernity.But history has no other way left: it must either move forward along the inertia which it has over the past few centuries, since New Time and the Enlightenment, or collapse. Everyone believed that somehow everything would resolve itself, and that the only thing that mattered was to effectively confront those who were categorized as the \"enemies of open society”, i.e., Putin, Iran, Islamic fundamentalism, or the new rise of nationalist movements rapidly responding to the crisis of mass migration. In general, no one thought of an alternative, even consciously ruling out such. And that is why, in the moment of serious crisis, the global liberal system has failed and collapsed. Almost no-one has understood this yet, but it has already happened. And it has happened irrevocably. Coronavirus, by its very fact and especially by the way in which it has been responded to by the \"world government\", has become the end of the modern world.The end of \"the Ego and Its Own\"Does this mean that humanity will die? This is still unknown, but it cannot be ruled out. One can only guess whether it will perish or not. But what can already be said with certainty is that the global world order based on capitalism, liberal democracy and the principles of the sovereign individual (civil society, the open society) has already perished. It is gone, it has collapsed, although desperate efforts will still be undertaken to save it for some time to come. How they will be deployed and how long they will last is not crucial now. It cannot be ruled out that it will disappear altogether like smoke, just like the Soviet system dissolved in thin air.That which just a second ago was, was fleeting, as if it never was. It is much more important to look at what is coming to replace the old world order.\n",
      "The most important thing to understand is that it is not merely a technical failure in the system of global governance that has happened, but rather the resulting, final element of the entire historical process of Modernity, of New Time, over the course of which power was transferred from the celestial subject to the earthly one, and this subject itself - through the ideological and political battles of the last centuries, including the world hot and cold wars - moved towards a certain crystallization, that of parliamentary democracy, the global capitalist market and the individual endowed with rights. The whole system of modern global capitalism is built on the premise of \"the Ego and its Own\" (Max Stirner). The political rights of the \"Ego\" (the individual in complete isolation from nation, race, religion, sex, etc.) were fixed and entrenched in the global systems of political democracy. Economic rights were embodied in the norms of private property and market mechanisms. Thus, the source of political power reached its imminent limit: in liberalism and globalism, the last hints of verticality and “transcendence\" which had been preserved still at the first stages of Modernity, in particular the structures of the state, were eliminated. Hence the globalist aspiration to abolish the sovereignty of the state and transfer its powers to the supranational level, thus legalizing the \"world government\", which de facto already exists. In other words, the political, economic, and ideological history of New Time moved towards a quite definite end, in which the purely human, immanent, individual subject would be finally formed and laid as the basis for political legitimization. Little was left to chance: the complete abolition of states which took place on the level of the European Union was to be repeated on a global scale.The cancelled finale of liberalism. This final moment, to which everything was headed, today is not merely postponed indefinitely, but is altogether cancelled. If political history could not reach this point without the coronavirus, then the whole process collapsed in the face of this epidemic. In order to effectively counteract the epidemic, the authorities of nearly all countries, including those of the West, have introduced compulsory quarantine with strict measures for its violation, or have outright declared emergency situations. The economic mechanisms of the global market have collapsed due to closure of borders, as have stock exchanges and financial institutions. The open society and unhindered migration have come into direct contradiction with basic sanitary standards. In fact, a dictatorial regime has rapidly been established all over the world, under which power has been transferred to a completely new entity. Neither \"the Ego\", nor \"its Own\", nor all of the world's giant superstructures that guaranteed their legal and legitimate rights and statuses are any longer considered the source of political power. What Giorgio Agamben has called the \"naked life\", i.e., the absolutely special, physical survival imperative that has nothing to do with the logic of liberal capitalism, has come to the foreground. Neither equality, rights, law, private property, collective decision-making, the system of mutual obligations, nor any other fundamental principle of liberal democracy has real power. Only those mechanisms that contribute to survival, to stopping infection and providing for the simplest, purely physiological, needs, are important now.But this means that the subject of power is radically changing. It is no longer the free society, nor the market, nor the humanist presumptions of the sovereign individual, nor guarantees of personal freedom and private life. All of this is to be sacrificed if the matter at hand is physical survival. Political rights are abolished, economic obligations are abolished, total surveillance and strict disciplinary control become the only overriding social norm.If the \"world government\" has gone into a state of emergency, proved unable to or did not even dare to bypass it, or was simply forced to accept it, then this means that the paradigm which just yesterday seemed to be unshakeable has been abandoned. And in this case, there is either no \"world government\" at all, and every society saves itself as it can, or the fundamental paradigm abruptly changes and turns into something else. Both in the first and in the second cases, the former order has collapsed, and something new is being built before our very eyes.Such radical conclusions are not just related to the scale of the pandemic, which is not even so great yet. Much more important is the perception of the epidemic by the power elites, who have so quickly and easily abandoned their seemingly inviolable foundations. That is the most fundamental thing. The measures aimed at combating the coronavirus have already undermined the foundations of liberal democracy and capitalism, rapidly abolishing the subject of power itself. From now on, the \"ego and its own\" is no longer the basis of legality and legitimacy: under the conditions of the State of Emergency, power is being transferred to another authority. Something new is becoming the bearer of sovereignty.So what is it?The coronavirus as the ruling subject: the secular gods of the plague. On the one hand, it could be said that the coronavirus itself (the virus has its \"royal\" name for a reason) is demonstrating a status unique to that of the subject. To better understand this, we can recall the ancient plague gods, who were considered formidable deities in the religious beliefs of the peoples of the Middle East. The peoples of Mesopotamia had Erra, Nergal, and others, and in the monotheistic traditions, in particular in Judaism, plagues were sent by the supreme deity, Yahweh, to punish the Jews for idolatry. In the Middle Ages, epidemics and plagues were considered signs of divine punishment. Traditional society can justifiably give the status of subjectivity to large-scale phenomena or link them to the divine element. However, in the New Time of Modernity, man held himself to be the complete master of life, hence the development of modern medicine, drugs, vaccines, etc. Therefore, it is as if the complete inability of governments to counteract the coronavirus today is casting mankind beyond the edge of New Time. But the God or gods to whom the modern virus plague could be ascribed and left to no longer exist. The modern world is convinced that the virus must have earthly, material and immanent origin. But what kind of materiality is stronger than man? Hereby arise the many conspiracy theories linking the origin of the virus to malefactors aspiring to establish their control over mankind. For the philosophers of \"speculative realism,\" who for decades have been thinking about the need to replace humanity with a system of objects - whether Artificial Intelligence or cyborgs - the virus itself might very well be granted the status of sovereign actor, a kind of hyperobject (a la Morton) capable of subjugating the masses of beings to its will, as does mold, the rhizome, and so on. In other words, the collapse of the liberal model brings to the forefront the hypothesis of the post-human, post-humanist actor.Coronavirus, whose Latin name literally means “the crowned poison”, is thus (at least theoretically) a contender for the center of the new world system. If the main concern of mankind from now on will be to counteract the virus, fight against it, protect against it, etc., then the whole system of values, rules and guarantees will be rebuilt according to absolutely new principles and priorities. Speculative realists go even further and are ready to recognize in the hyperobject the presence of infernal entities of the ancient gods of chaos emerging out of the bottom of existence, but it is not necessary to go that far, insofar as, if we simply assume that\n",
      "political, economic and ideological rationality will henceforth be built around the counteraction of contagious viruses, we will live in a different - for example, in a hygienocentric - world, organized in a completely different way than the modern world. The \"Ego\", \"its Own\" and all the structures which guarantee them predictability, stability and protection, which elevate them to the status of the foundations of legality and legitimacy, will fall into the background, while the coronavirus or its analogue will establish a different hierarchy, a different political and economic ontology, a different ideology.The state vs. coronavirus. But which state?If we look at how the fight against coronavirus is unfolding today, we can notice an abruptly sharp increase in the role of the state, which over the course of globalization was considerably relegated to the back-burner. It is at the level of the state that decisions on quarantine, self- isolation, travel bans, restrictions on freedoms and economic measures, are being made. In fact, everywhere in the world - whether openly or by default - a state of emergency has been declared. According to the classics of political thought, and in particular Carl Schmitt, this means the establishment of a regime of dictatorship. The sovereign, according to Schmitt, is he who makes the decision in an emergency situation (Ernstfall), and today this is the state. However, it should not be forgotten that today’s state has until the altogether recent last moment been based on the principles of liberal democracy, capitalism, and the ideology of human rights. In other words, this state is, in some sense, deciding on the liquidation of its own philosophical and ideological basis (even if such are for now formalized, temporary measures, the Roman Empire still began with the temporary dictatorship of Caesar, which gradually became permanent). Thus, the state is rapidly mutating, just as the virus itself is mutating, and the state is following the coronavirus in this constantly evolving struggle, which is taking the situation ever further from the point of global liberal democracy. All the extant borders which until yesterday seemed to be erased or half-erased are once again gaining fundamental meaning - not only for those who are going to cross them, but also for those who simply have managed in time to return to their country. At the same time, in larger countries this fragmentation is being carried over to individual regions, where states of emergency are leading to the establishment of their own, regional dictatorships, which in turn will be strengthened as communication with the center becomes more difficult. Such fragmentation will continue all the way down to small towns and even individual households, where forced closure will open up new horizons and volumes of domestic violence.The state is taking upon itself the mission of fighting the coronavirus under certain conditions, but is waging this fight in already different circumstances. Over the course of this mission, all state institutions related to law, legality and economy are being transformed. Thus, the very introduction of quarantine completely overturns the logic of the market, according to which only the balance of supply and demand and the agreements concluded between employer and employee can regulate the relations between them. Bans on working for hygienic reasons are irrevocably collapsing the entire construction of capitalism. The suspension of freedom of movement, assembly and democratic procedures is blocking the institutions of political democracy and paralyzing individual freedoms.Post-liberal dictatorship. Over the course of this epidemic, a new state is emerging which is beginning to function with new rules. It is very likely that in the process of the state of emergency there will be a shift of power from formal rulers to technical and technological functionaries, e.g., the military, epidemiologists, and institutions especially created for such extreme circumstances. The physical threat which the virus poses to leaders is forcing them to be placed in special conditions that are not always compatible with full control over situations. As legal norms are suspended, new algorithms of behavior and new practices are beginning to be deployed. Thus is born the dictatorial state, which, unlike the liberal-democratic state, has completely different goals, foundations, principles and axioms. In this case, the \"world government\" is dissolved, because any supranational strategy loses all meaning. Power is rapidly moving to an ever lower level - but not to society and not to citizens, but to the military-technological and medical-sanitary level. A radically new rationality is gaining force - not the rationale of democracy, freedom, the market and individualism, but that of pure survival, for which responsibility is assumed by a subject combining direct power and the possession of technical, technological, and medical logistics. Moreover, in the network society, such is based on a system of total surveillance excluding any kind of privacy.Thus, if at one end we have the virus as the subject of transformation, then at the other end we have military-medical surveillance and punitive dictatorship fundamentally differing in all parameters from the state that we knew until yesterday. It is not at all guaranteed that such a state, in its fight against the secular \"plague gods”, will precisely coincide with the borders of existing national entities. Since there will be no ideology or politics beyond the straightforward logic of survival, centralization itself will lose its meaning and its legitimacy.From civil society to \"naked life”. Here once again let us recall the \"naked life\" of Giorgio Agamben, who in a similar vein and based on Schmitt's ideas on the \"state of emergency\" analyzed the situation in Nazi concentration camps, where the dehumanization of people attained the extreme, under which the \"naked life\" revealed itself. The “naked life” is not human life, but some other life that is beyond the limits of self-consciousness, personality, individuality, rights, and so on. Hence why Agamben has been more radical than others and opposed the measures taken against the coronavirus, preferring even death to the introduction of a state of emergency. He clearly saw that even a small step in this direction will change the entire structure of the world order. Entering the stage of dictatorship is easy, but exiting it is sometimes impossible.The \"naked life” is the victim of the virus. It is not people, families, citizens, or private owners. Here there is neither one nor many. There is only the fact of infection, which can turn anyone - including oneself - into an other, and therefore into the enemy of \"naked life.” And it is fighting this other, \"naked life\" that grants dictatorship the new status of the subject. Then, society itself, at the mercy of dictatorship, will be turned into “naked life” organized by the dictatorship in accordance with its own peculiar rationality. Out of fear of the coronavirus, people are ready to go for any of the steps of those who have taken upon themselves responsibility for the state of emergency.Thus, the fundamental split between the healthy and the sick, considered by Michel Foucault in his book \"Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison”, becomes even more impassable of a line than all the oppositions of the classical ideologies of Modernity, e.g., between the bourgeoisie and proletariat, the Aryans and Jews, the liberals and “enemies of the open society”, etc., and will see its dividing line set between the poles of the “naked life” and “medical technologists”, who have in their hands all the instruments of violence, surveillance, and authority. The difference between the already sick and the not yet sick which at first justified the new dictatorship will be erased, and the dictatorship of virologists, which has built new legitimacy on the basis of this distinction, will create a completely new model.\n",
      "The new dictatorship is neither fascism nor communism. This situation will seem to many to be reminiscent of fascism or communism, but these parallels are imaginary. Both fascism and communism represented types of “civil society”, albeit totalitarian ones, with pronounced ideologies which guaranteed civil rights - not to all, but to the significant and, de facto, overwhelming majority of their citizens. Liberalism, by reducing all identities down to the level of the individual, paved the way and created the preconditions for a special type of post-liberal dictatorship that, unlike communism and fascism, should have no ideology at all, insofar as it will have no reason to persuade, mobilize, or \"seduce\" the element of the “naked life\". The \"naked life” is already consciously ready to surrender to dictatorship, regardless of what it promises or insists on. The structures of such a dictatorship will be built on the basis of the fact that it opposes the virus, not on the basis of ideas and preferences. The military-medical hygienic dictatorship will be characterized by a post-liberal logic, for which the only operation will be rational treatment of the \"naked life\", the bearers of which have no rights at all and no identity. This order will be built along the infected vs. healthy watershed, and this dual code will be as powerful as it is obvious, with no need for any justification or argumentation.Artificial Intelligence and its enemies. Here the following consideration comes to mind: in the carriers of such a post-liberal anti-virus dictatorship, we see virtually no properly human traits. Any humanity would only hinder the most effective operation on the \"naked life\", and would thus represent a restless, trembling,survival-at-all-costs-seeking chaos. Consequently, Artificial Intelligence, abstract mechanical calculation, would cope best with this task. In military-medical dictatorship we see a distinct cybernetic dimension, something machine-like and mechanical. If the \"naked life\" is chaos, then there must be a cold mathematical order at the other pole. And from now on, its only legitimization will be not the consent of society, which loses everything but its survival instinct, but the very criterion of its ability to make balanced logical decisions without being affected by superfluous emotions and passions. Therefore, even if a military-medical hygienic dictatorship is established by people, sooner or later its main bearers will be machines.There will be no return Several conclusions can be drawn from this very preliminary analysis of the near future - the future that has already begun:It is impossible to go back to the world order that existed only recently and which seemed so familiar and natural that no one thought about its ephemerality. Liberalism either did not reach its natural end and the establishment of a \"world government\", or nihilistic collapse was its original goal, merely covered by increasingly less convincing and increasingly perverse \"humanist\" decor. Proponents of philosophical \"accelerationism\" speak of \"Black Enlightenment,\" emphasizing this dark, nihilistic aspect of liberalism as representing merely the accelerated movement of man toward the abyss of post-humanism. But in any case, instead of \"world government\" and total democracy, we are entering an era of new fragmentation, of \"closed societies\" and radical dictatorship, perhaps exceeding Nazi concentration camps and the Soviet gulag.The end of globalization will not mean, however, a simple transition to the Westphalian system, to realism and a system of closed trade states (Fichte). Such would require the well- defined ideology that existed in early Modernity, but which was completely eradicated in late Modernity, and especially in Postmodernity. The demonization of anything remotely resembling “nationalism” or “fascism” has led to the total rejection of national identities, and now the severity of the biological threat and its crude physiological nature makes national myths superfluous. The military-medical dictatorship does not need additional methods to motivate the masses, and moreover, nationalism only enhances the dignity, self-consciousness and civil feeling of society which contradict the rules of the \"naked life\". For the society to come, there are only two criteria - healthy and sick. All other forms of identity, including national ones, have no meaning. Approximately the same was true for communism, which was also a motivating ideology that mobilized the consciousness of citizens to build a better society. All these ideologies are archaic, meaningless, redundant and counterproductive in the fight against coronavirus. Therefore, it would be wrong to see any \"new fascism\" or \"new communism\" in the impending post-liberal paradigm. It will be something else. It cannot be ruled out that this new stage will affect so greatly the life of humankind or what will remain of it that, having passed through all these trials and tribulations, mankind will be ready to accept any form of power, any ideology, and any order that will weaken the terror of the Artificial Intelligence-military-medical dictatorship. And then, in a cycle, we cannot rule out a return to the project of \"world government\", but this will already be on a completely different basis, because society will be irreversibly changed over the period of “quarantine\". It will no longer be the choice of \"civil society\", but the cry of \"naked life”, which will recognize any authority that can offer deliverance from the horror that has occurred. This would be the right time for what Christians call the \"Antichrist\" to appear.Exaggeration and the liquidation of leaders Is such an analytical forecast too much of a dramatized exaggeration? I think it is quite realistic, although, of course, \"nobody knows the time\", and in any situation everything might be postponed for some time. The epidemic could end abruptly and a vaccine will be found. But all that has alPANDEMIC AND THE POLITICS OF SURVIVAL: THE HORIZONS OF A NEW TYPE OF DICTATORSHIP\n",

      "The global coronavirus pandemic has huge geopolitical implications. The world will never be the same again. However, it is premature to talk about what kind of world it will end up being. The epidemic has not passed: we have not even reached the peak. The main unknowns remain the following:how many losses will humanity suffer in the end - how many deaths?who will be able to stop the spread of the virus and how?what will be the real consequences for those who fell ill and for those who survived?No one can yet answer these questions, even roughly, and therefore we cannot even remotely imagine what the real damage will be. In the worst case, the pandemic will lead to a serious drop in the world population. At best, panic will prove premature and unfounded. But even after the first months of the pandemic, some global geopolitical changes are already quite evident and largely irreversible. No matter how the events that follow will develop, something in the world order has changed once and for all.The outbreak of the coronavirus epidemic represents a decisive moment in the destruction of the unipolar world and the collapse of globalization. The crisis of unipolarity and the breakdown of globalization have been evident since the beginning of the 2000s - the catastrophe of September 11, the strong growth of the Chinese economy, the return to Putin's Russia's global politics as an increasingly sovereign entity , the strong mobilization of the Islamic factor, the growing migration crisis and the rise of populism in Europe and even in the United States, which led to the election of Trump and many other parallel phenomena, made it clear that the world formed in the nineties around the predominance of the West, the United States and global capitalism has entered a phase of crisis. The multipolar world order begins to form with new central actors, civilizations, as anticipated by Samuel Huntington [Cfr. Aleksandr Dugin, Multipolar World Theory , AGA Editrice, 2019, NdT]. But in the face of the signs of an emerging multipolarity, one thing is a trend, another is objective reality. It is like ice cracked in the spring - it is clear that it will not last long, but at the same time, it is undeniable that you can also move on it, even if you run some risk. Nobody can be sure when the cracked ice will actually give up.Now we can start a countdown to a multipolar world order and the starting point is the coronavirus epidemic. The pandemic has buried globalization, open society and the global capitalist system. The virus forced us on ice and the individual enclaves of humanity began to take their own isolated historical trajectories.Coronavirus has buried all the major myths of globalization:the effectiveness of open borders and the interdependence of countries in the world,the ability of supranational institutions to cope with an extraordinary situation,the sustainability of the global financial system and the global economy as a whole, facing serious challenges, the futility of centralized states, socialist regimes and disciplinary methods in solving acute problems and the total superiority of liberal strategies towards them,\n",
      "- the total triumph of liberalism as a panacea for all problematic situations.Their solutions have not worked in Italy, nor in other European Union countries, nor in the United States. The only thing that proved effective was the clear closure of society, dependence on internal resources, the strong power of the state and the isolation of the sick from the healthy, citizens from foreigners, etc.At the same time, Western countries also reacted to the pandemic in a very different way: the Italians introduced the total quarantine, Macron introduced a state dictatorship regime (in the Jacobin spirit), Merkel has allocated 500 billion euros to support the population, and Boris Johnson, following the spirit of Anglo-Saxon individualism, suggested that the disease should be considered a private matter affecting every English taken individually and refused to perform the swab tests, sympathizing in advance with those who lose loved ones. Trump established a state of emergency in the United States, closing connections with Europe and the rest of the world. If the West acts in such a disparate and contradictory way, what will become of the rest of the countries? Everyone seems to be saved as they can. This goal was best achieved by China, which, thanks to the practical policies of the Communist Party, established strict disciplinary methods to combat contagion, accusing the United States of spreading it. The same accusation was made by Iran, which was hit hard by the virus - even among the leaders of the country.Thus, the virus tore open society to pieces and pushed humanity forward on its path to a multipolar world.Regardless of how the fight against coronavirus will end, it is clear that globalization has collapsed. This could almost certainly mark the end of liberalism and its total ideological domination. It is difficult to predict the final version of the future world order - especially in its details. Multipolarism is a system that historically has never existed, and if we look for some remote analogy, we should not turn to the era of the more or less equivalent European states according to the Westphalian world, but to the period before the era of the Great Geographical Discoveries, when, together with Europe (divided into western and eastern Christian countries), the Islamic world, India, China and Russia existed as independent civilizations. The same civilizations existed in the pre-colonial period in America (the Incas, the Aztecs, etc. ) and in Africa. There were links and contacts between these civilizations, but there was no single type of link with universal values, institutions and systems.The post coronavirus world is likely to include individual regions of the world, civilizations, continents that are gradually transforming themselves into independent actors. At the same time, the universal model of liberal capitalism is likely to collapse. This model currently serves as the common denominator of the whole structure of unipolarity: from the absolutization of the market to parliamentary democracy and the ideology of human rights, including the notion of progress and the law of technological development which have risen to the rank of dogma in the 'Europe  New Age  (of the New Times) and have spread to all human societies through colonization (directly or indirectly in the form of westernization).Much will depend on who defeats the epidemic and how: where disciplinary measures prove effective, they will enter the future political and economic order as an essential component. The same conclusion can be reached by those who, on the other hand, will not be able to face the threat of a pandemic through the opening and absence of severe measures. Temporary alienation dictated by the direct threat of contagion from another country and from another region, the breakdown of economic ties and the necessary alienation from a single financial system will force the states affected by the epidemic to seek self-sufficiency, because the priority will be food security, minimum autonomy and economic autarchy to meet the vital needs of the population, beyond any economic dogma considered mandatory before the coronavirus crisis. Even where liberalism and capitalism are preserved, they will be placed in a national framework in the spirit of mercantilist theories that insist on maintaining the monopoly of foreign trade in the hands of the state. Those who are less tied to the liberal tradition can very well move in the areas of the most optimal organization of the \"great space\" in other directions - taking into account the civilizational and cultural specificities.\n",
      "It cannot be said in advance what the multipolar model as a whole will eventually become, but the very fact of breaking the universally binding dogma of liberal globalization will open up completely new opportunities and paths for each civilization.After the coronavirus: multipolar security. The multipolar world will create a completely new security architecture. It may not be more sustainable or adaptable to conflict resolution, but it will be different. In this new model, the West, the United States and NATO, if NATO still exists, will be only one factor among others. The United States itself will clearly not be able (and probably will not, if Trump's line eventually prevails in Washington) to play the role of sole global arbiter, and therefore the United States will acquire a different status after the quarantine and emergency state. It can be compared to Israel's role in the Middle East. Israel is undoubtedly a powerful country, which actively influences the balance of power in the region, but does not export its ideology and values ​​to the surrounding Arab countries. On the contrary, it retains its Jewish identity for itself, rather trying to free itself from readers of other values ​​rather than include them in its composition. The construction of a wall with Mexico and Trump's invitation to the Americans to focus on their internal problems is similar to Israel's path: the United States will be a powerful power, but its liberal-capitalist ideology will have value are for themselves , without attracting third parties. The same will apply to Europe. As a result, the most important factor in the unipolar world will radically change its status. The construction of a wall with Mexico and Trump's invitation to the Americans to focus on their internal problems is similar to Israel's path: the United States will be a powerful power, but its liberal-capitalist ideology will have value are for themselves , without attracting third parties.

The same will apply to Europe. As a result, the most important factor in the unipolar world will radically change its status.This, of course, will lead to a redistribution of forces and functions among other civilizations. Europe, if it maintains its unity in some way, is likely to create its own military blockade independent of the United States, which has already been mentioned after the collapse of the Soviet Union (the Eurocorps project  ) and to which Macron and Merkel have repeatedly mentioned. While not directly hostile to the United States, such a blockade will in many cases pursue purely European interests, which at times may differ significantly from those of the United States. This will primarily affect relations with Russia, Iran, China and the Islamic world.China will have to transform itself from the beneficiary of globalization and adapt to pursue its national interests as a regional power. This is exactly what all the processes in China are heading towards lately - the strengthening of Xi Jianping's power, the \"One Belt One Road\" project, etc. It will no longer be a globalization with Chinese characteristics, but a project explicitly focused on the Far East with peculiar Confucian and partly socialist characteristics. Clearly, conflicts in the Pacific Ocean with the United States will worsen at some point.The Islamic world will face a difficult problem linked to the new paradigm of self-organization, since in the conditions of formation of the great spaces - Europe, China, USA, Russia, etc. - the individual Islamic countries will not be fully commensurate with the rest and effectively defend their interests. There will be a need for several Islamic integration poles - Shiites (with the center in Iran) and Sunnis, where, together with Indonesia and Pakistan in the east, a western Sunni bloc will probably be built around Turkey and some Arab countries such as Egypt or the Gulf States.And finally, in the multipolar world order, Russia will have the historical possibility of strengthening itself as an independent civilization that will see its power increase following the strong decline of the West and its internal geopolitical fragmentation. But, at the same time, this will also represent a challenge: before establishing itself fully as one of the most influential and powerful poles of the multipolar world, Russia will have to pass the test of maturity, preserving its unity and reaffirming its areas of influence in the Eurasian space. It is not yet clear where the southern and western borders of Russia-Eurasia will be post coronavirus. This will largely depend on what regime, what methods and efforts Russia will use to deal with the pandemic and what political consequences this will have. Moreover, it is impossible to predict with cognition the state of the other \"great spaces\" - the poles of the multipolar world. The establishment of the Russian perimeter will depend on many factors, some of which may prove to be rather acute and conflicting.Gradually, a multipolar settlement system will be formed - both based on a UN reformed under the conditions of multipolarity, and in the form of some new organization. Again, it will all depend on how the fight against coronavirus will unfold.The virus as a mission. Without pretense: the coronavirus pandemic represents a turning point in world history. Not only are stock indices and oil prices plummeting, the world order itself is also plummeting. We live in the period that marks the end of liberalism and its \"obviousness\" as a global meta-narrative, the end of its dispositions and standards. Human societies will soon become freely floating: no more dogmas, no more imperialism than the dollar, no more spells of the free market, no more dictatorship than the Fed or global stock exchanges, no more enslavement to the world media elite. Each pole will build its future on its civilization foundations. It is obviously impossible to say what this will look like or what it will bring. However,What neither ideologies, nor wars, nor bitter economic conflicts, nor terror, nor religious movements have been able to do, has been accomplished by an invisible but deadly virus. It brought with it death, suffering, horror, panic, pain ... but also the future.THE CORONAVIRUS AND THE HORIZON OF A MULTIPOLAR WORLD: THE GEOPOLITICAL POSSIBILITIES OF THE EPIDEMIC\n",

      "Last year a mysterious shipment was caught smuggling Coronavirus from Canada. It was traced to Chinese agents working at a Canadian lab. Subsequent investigation by GreatGameIndia linked the agents to Chinese Biological Warfare Program from where the virus is suspected to have leaked causing the Wuhan Coronavirus outbreak.Note: The findings of this investigation has been corroborated by none other than the Bioweapons expert Dr. Francis Boyle who drafted the Biological Weapons Convention Act followed by many nations. The report has caused a major international controversy and is suppressed actively by a section of mainstream media.The Saudi SARS Sample. On June 13, 2012 a 60-year-old Saudi man was admitted to a private hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, with a 7-day history of fever, cough, expectoration, and shortness of breath. He had no history of cardiopulmonary or renal disease, was receiving no long-term medications, and did not smoke.Egyptian virologist Dr. Ali Mohamed Zaki isolated and identified a previously unknown coronavirus from his lungs. After routine diagnostics failed to identify the causative agent, Zaki contacted Ron Fouchier, a leading virologist at the Erasmus Medical Center (EMC) in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, for advice. Fouchier sequenced the virus from a sample sent by Zaki. Fouchier used a broad-spectrum “pan-coronavirus” real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method to test for distinguishing features of a number of known coronaviruses known to infect humans.This Coronavirus sample was acquired by Scientific Director Dr. Frank Plummer (key to Coronavirus investigation Frank Plummer was recently assassinated in Africa) of Canada’s National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) in Winnipeg directly from Fouchier, who received it from Zaki. This virus was reportedly stolen from the Canadian lab by Chinese agents.The Canadian Lab\n",
      "Coronavirus arrived at Canada’s NML Winnipeg facility on May 4, 2013 from the Dutch lab. The Canadian lab grew up stocks of the virus and used it to assess diagnostic tests being used in Canada. Winnipeg scientists worked to see which animal species can be infected with the new virus.Research was done in conjunction with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency’s national lab, the National Centre for Foreign Animal Diseases which is housed in the same complex as the National Microbiology Laboratory.NML has a long history of offering comprehensive testing services for coronaviruses. It isolated and provided the first genome sequence of the SARS coronavirus and identified another coronavirus NL63 in 2004.This Winnipeg based Canadian lab was targeted by Chinese agents in what could be termed as Biological Espionage.Chinese Biological Espionage. In March 2019, in mysterious event a shipment of exceptionally virulent viruses from Canada’s NML ended up in China. The event caused a major scandal with Bio-warfare experts questioning why Canada was sending lethal viruses to China. Scientists from NML said the highly lethal viruses were a potential bio-weapon.\n",
      "Following investigation, the incident was traced to Chinese agents working at NML. Four months later in July 2019, a group of Chinese virologists were forcibly dispatched from the Canadian National Microbiology Laboratory (NML). The NML is Canada’s only level-4 facility and one of only a few in North America equipped to handle the world’s deadliest diseases, including Ebola, SARS, Coronavirus, etc.Xiangguo Qiu – The Chinese Bio-Warfare Agent. The NML scientist who was escorted out of the Canadian lab along with her husband, another biologist, and members of her research team is believed to be a Chinese Bio-Warfare agent Xiangguo Qiu. Qiu was the head of the Vaccine Development and Antiviral Therapies Section in the Special Pathogens Program at Canada’s NML.Xiangguo Qiu is an outstanding Chinese scientist born in Tianjin. She primarily received her medical doctor degree from Hebei Medical University in China in 1985 and came to Canada for graduate studies in 1996. Later on, she was affiliated with the Institute of Cell Biology and the Department of Pediatrics and Child Health of the University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, not engaged with studying pathogens. But a shift took place, somehow. Since 2006, she has been studying powerful viruses in Canada’s NML. The viruses shipped from the NML to China were studied by her in 2014, for instance (together with the viruses Machupo, Junin, Rift Valley Fever, Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever and Hendra).Infiltrating the Canadian Lab. Dr. Xiangguo Qiu is married to another Chinese scientist – Dr. Keding Cheng, also affiliated with the NML, specifically the “Science and Technology Core”. Dr. Cheng is primarily a bacteriologist who shifted to virology. The couple is responsible for infiltrating Canada’s NML with many Chinese agents as students from a range of Chinese scientific facilities directly tied to China’s Biological Warfare Program, namely:Institute of Military Veterinary, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Changchun. Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Chengdu Military Region. Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hubei.Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing. All of the above four mentioned Chinese Biological Warfare facilities collaborated with Dr. Xiangguo Qiu within the context of Ebola virus, the Institute of Military Veterinary joined a study on the Rift Valley fever virus too, while the Institute of Microbiology joined a study on Marburg virus. Noticeably, the drug used in the latter study – Favipiravir – has been earlier tested successfully by the Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences, with the designation JK-05 (originally a Japanese patent registered in China already in 2006), against Ebola and additional viruses.However, the studies by Dr. Qiu are considerably more advanced and apparently vital for the Chinese biological weapons development in case Coronavirus, Ebola, Nipah, Marburg or Rift Valley fever viruses are included therein.The Canadian investigation is ongoing and questions remain whether previous shipments to China of other viruses or other essential preparations, took place from 2006 to 2018, one way or another.Dr. Xiangguo Qiu also collaborated in 2018 with three scientists from the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, Maryland, studying post-exposure immunotherapy for two Ebola viruses and Marburg virus in monkeys; a study supported by the US Defense Threat Reduction Agency.The Wuhan Coronavirus. Dr. Xiangguo Qiu made at least five trips over the school year 2017-18 to the above mentioned Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which was certified for BSL4 in January 2017. Moreover, in August 2017, the National Health Commission of China approved research activities involving Ebola, Nipah, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses at the Wuhan facility.Coincidentally, the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory is located only 20 miles away from the Huanan Seafood Market which is the epicenter of the Coronavirus outbreak dubbed the Wuhan Coronavirus.The Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory is housed at the Chinese military facility Wuhan Institute of Virology linked to China’s Biological Warfare Program. It was the first ever lab in the country designed to meet biosafety-level-4 (BSL-4) standards – the highest biohazard level, meaning that it would be qualified to handle the most dangerous pathogens. \n",
      "In January 2018, the lab was operational ‘for global experiments on BSL-4 pathogens,’ wrote Guizhen Wu in the journal Biosafety and Health. ‘After a laboratory leak incident of SARS in 2004, the former Ministry of Health of China initiated the construction of preservation laboratories for high-level pathogens such as SARS, coronavirus, and pandemic influenza virus,’ wrote Guizhen Wu.Coronavirus Bioweapon. The Wuhan institute has studied coronaviruses in the past, including the strain that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, H5N1 influenza virus, Japanese encephalitis, and dengue. Researchers at the institute also studied the germ that causes anthrax – a biological agent once developed in Russia.“Coronaviruses (particularly SARS) have been studied in the institute and are probably held therein,” said Dany Shoham, a former Israeli military intelligence officer who has studied Chinese biowarfare. He said. “SARS is included within the Chinese BW program, at large, and is dealt with in several pertinent facilities.”James Giordano, a neurology professor at Georgetown University and senior fellow in Biowarfare at the U.S. Special Operations Command, said China’s growing investment in bio-science, looser ethics around gene-editing and other cutting-edge technology and integration between government and academia raise the spectre of such pathogens being weaponized.That could mean an offensive agent, or a modified germ let loose by proxies, for which only China has the treatment or vaccine. “This is not warfare, per se,” he said. “But what it’s doing is leveraging the capability to act as global saviour, which then creates various levels of macro and micro economic and bio-power dependencies.”China’s Biological Warfare Program. In a 2015 academic paper, Shoham – of Bar-Ilan’s Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies – asserts that more than 40 Chinese facilities are involved in bio-weapon production.China’s Academy of Military Medical Sciences actually developed an Ebola drug – called JK-05 — but little has been divulged about it or the defence facility’s possession of the virus, prompting speculation its Ebola cells are part of China’s bio-warfare arsenal, Shoham told the National Post.Ebola is classified as a “category A” bioterrorism agent by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, meaning it could be easily transmitted from person to person, would result in high death rates and “might cause panic.” The CDC lists Nipah as a category C substance, a deadly emerging pathogen that could be engineered for mass dissemination.China’s Biological Warfare Program is believed to be in an advanced stage that includes research and development, production and weaponization capabilities. Its current inventory is believed to include the full range of traditional chemical and biological agents with a wide variety of delivery systems including artillery rockets, aerial bombs, sprayers, and short-range ballistic missiles.Weaponizing Biotech.China’s national strategy of military-civil fusion has highlighted biology as a priority, and the People’s Liberation Army could be at the forefront of expanding and exploiting this knowledge.The PLA is pursuing military applications for biology and looking into promising intersections with other disciplines, including brain science, supercomputing, and artificial intelligence. Since 2016, the Central Military Commission has funded projects on military brain science, advanced biomimetic systems, biological and biomimetic materials, human performance enhancement, and “new concept” biotechnology.In 2016, an AMMS doctoral researcher published a dissertation, “Research on the Evaluation of Human Performance Enhancement Technology,” which characterized CRISPR-Cas as one of three primary technologies that might boost troops’ combat effectiveness. The supporting research looked at the effectiveness of the drug Modafinil, which has applications in cognitive enhancement; and at transcranial magnetic stimulation, a type of brain stimulation, while also contending that the “great potential” of CRISPR-Cas. as a “military deterrence technology in which China should “grasp the initiative” in development.In 2016, the potential strategic value of genetic information led the Chinese government to launch the National Genebank, which intends to become the world’s largest repository of such data. It aims to “develop and utilize China’s valuable genetic resources, safeguard national security in bioinformatics, and enhance China’s capability to seize the strategic commanding heights” in the domain of Biotechnology Warfare.Chinese military’s interest in biology as an emerging domain of warfare is guided by strategists who talk about potential “genetic weapons” and the possibility of a “bloodless victory.”This story has been published in full in one of the world’s largest Chinese TV News Network – NTDTV.\n",

      "A few days ago, Dr. Tedros, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) repeated what he said already a few weeks ago, that there are about 20 pharmaceutical laboratories throughout the world that are developing a vaccine for the novel coronavirus, named COVID-19, also called 2019-nCOV, or SARS-CoV-2. For the layman, it is just a stronger mutation of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus, that broke out in 2002 / 2003, also in China. To be sure, a mutation made in a laboratory. In a US high-security biological warfare laboratory. In other words, both SARS and COVID-19 – among many other bio-war agents – were made in the US.And now, the chaotic western-style race of private corporations for a vaccine wanting to outdo one another, has begun.\n",
      "Who is first to develop a vaccine? – It’s a fierce competition to establish a patent, a monopoly – for a possibly multi trillion-dollar business. Its western neoliberal capitalism at its very worst – or best, depending on the angle from where one looks.There are no words to describe this chaotic fever for profit over human wellbeing. It has nothing to do with health, with healing sick and suffering, possibly dying people. It’s all about money. Hundreds of billions, if not trillion of profit for the pharmaceutical oligarch and their associated research laboratories and enterprises. And even more so, if the WHO-declared “pandemic” (sic) will prompt a forced vaccination campaign, enhanced by military and police surveillance.Let’s put COVID-19 in context. As of 23 March 2020 (18:33 GMT), and according to WHO statistics, reported worldwide cases are 372572; deaths 16313; recovered 101373 – a death rate of 4.37%. However, these figures must be considered with caution. In many countries, especially developing economies, accurate testing may be a problem. Test kits are often not available, or not reliable. So, may people who go to the doctor with some flu symptoms are possibly falsely diagnosed as COVID-19 victims, as it serves the publicity hype.Miscalculations and false reporting may even occur in the United States. Mr. Robert Redfield, CEO of the US Center for Disease Control (CDC), testified before Congress that CDC does no longer carry out regular tests, that these were carried out at State-level and only in extreme cases. See also this reference form the LA Times of California measures and directives.By comparison, the US CDC estimates that in the 2019 / 2020 flu season in the US alone, some 38 to 54 million people may catch the common flu, and 23000 to 59000 may die from it. The vast majority of these deaths will be elderly people above 70-years of age and many of them with pre-health conditions and /or pre-existing respiratory problems. This is pretty much the same disease and death pattern as with COVID-19. Expanding these common flu figures linearly on a worldwide scale would result in hundreds of thousands of flu deaths. In the particularly strong 2017-2018 US flu season, an estimated 60000 people died from the flu in the US alone. The reader may himself judge whether WHO was justified declaring COVID-19 a “pandemic” — or whether there may have been – just perhaps – another agenda behind it?The vaccine that might eventually be applied to COVID-19, may most likely no longer be valid for the next coronavirus outbreak – which, also according to Mr. Redfield, CDC, will most probably occur. A later virus may most certainly have mutated. It’s quite similar to the common flu virus. In fact, the annually reoccurring common flu virus contains a proportion of 10% to 15% (some times more) of coronaviruses.\n",
      "The effectiveness of the annual flu vaccines is on average less than 50%, not to mention all the potential harmful side effects, they carry along. COVID-19 is very similar to influenza. Will a corona virus vaccine be equally weak in protecting a potential patient from a future infection?Cooperation instead of competition, doesn’t occur in the west. It’s all profit-driven. With a number of different vaccines from different pharma giants coming on the market, who will tell the patient which one is the best, most suitable for the patient’s condition? It smells like an utter chaotic scam.The real question is – are vaccines – or a vaccine – even necessary? Maybe – maybe not. The production of vaccines is pushed for profit motives and for an important political agenda for a New World Order – that has been planned to change human life as we know it, or thought we knew it. See further explanations below.Vaccines don’t heal, they may prevent the virus from hitting as hard as it might otherwise do, or not at all, depending on the age, physical and health condition of a person. Worldwide statistics show that usually a person up to the age of 40 or 50, who is infected by the COVID-19, has none or only slight symptoms, nothing to worry about.Should symptoms show up, staying home, resting and using traditional, age-old medicine, the same that might be used for the common flu, might be enough to get rid of the virus. This might resolve the disease within one or two weeks. Then, the person will be naturally “vaccinated” against this strand of coronavirus. Elderly people above 65 or 70 may be more at risk and special attention may be in order – separated from crowds, isolation during a two-week quarantine (the incubation period), while the rest of society goes on with life as normal as possible, thereby reducing the huge cost to society.China has brought the COVID-19 pandemic under control without a vaccine, but using common sense and traditional, rather inexpensive medication. What are these regular medicines that are effective and have helped to bring COVID-19 under control in China, without a vaccine?The “Children’s Health Defense” (the Children’s Defense Fund – CDF), an American NGO, founded 1973 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., depicts the current power struggle in France between health official and the country’s leading experts in virology, as representative for the worldwide fight between corporate pharma supported by (bought) governments and international organizations, such as WHO – and renowned scientists. If laid open, it is an eye-opener. See full CDF study.French Professor Didier Raoult, who is one of the world’s top 5 scientists on communicable diseases, argued that the approach of mass quarantine is both inefficient and outdated and that large-scale testing and treatment of suspected cases achieves far better results.Early on, Dr. Raoult suggested the use of hydroxychloroquine (Chloroquine or Plaquenil), a well-known, simple, and inexpensive drug, also used to fight Malaria, and that has shown efficacy with previous coronaviruses such as SARS. By mid-February 2020, clinical trials at his institute and in China already confirmed that the drug could reduce the viral load and bring spectacular improvement. The Chinese scientists published their first trials on more than 100 patients and announced that the Chinese National Health Commission would recommend Chloroquine in their new guidelines to treat Covid-19.In addition, China and Cuba are working together with the use of Interferon Alpha 2B, a highly efficient anti-viral drug developed in Cuba some 39 years, but little known to the world, because of the US imposed embargo on anything from Cuba. Interferon has also proven to be very effective in fighting COVID-19 and is now produced in a joint-venture in China.\n",
      "Chinese researchers in cooperation with Cuban scientists are also developing a vaccine which may soon be ready for testing. In contrast to the west, working exclusively on profit-motives, the Chinese-Cuban vaccine would be made available at low cost to the entire world.Other simple, but effective remedies include the use of heavy doses of Vitamin C, as well as Vitamin D3, or more generally the use of Micronutrients essential to fight infections, include vitamins A, B, C, D, and E.Another remedy that has been used for thousands of years by ancient Chinese, Romans and Egyptians, are Colloidal silver products. They come in forms to be administered as a liquid by mouth, or injected, or applied to the skin. Colloidal silver products are boosting the immune system, fighting bacteria and viruses, and have been used for treating cancer, HIV/AIDS, shingles, herpes, eye ailments, prostatitis – and COVID-19.\n",
      "Yet another simple and inexpensive remedy, to be used in combination with others, is menthol-based “Mentholatum”. It’s used for common flu and cold symptoms. Rubbed on and around the nose, it acts as a disinfectant and prevents germs to enter the respiratory track.Northern Italy and New Orleans report that an unusual number of patients had to be hospitalized in Intensive Care Units (ICU) and be put 24×7 on a 90% strength respirator, with some of them remaining unresponsive, going into respiratory failure. The reported death rate is about 40%. The condition is called acute respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS. That means the lungs are filled with fluid. When this description of ARDS episodes applies, Dr. Raoult and other medical colleagues recommend COVID-19 patients to “sleep sitting up” until they are cured. This helps drain the liquid out of the lungs. The method has been known to work successfully since it was first documented during the 1918 Spanish Flu epidemic.As you may expect, if you look up any of these alternative cures on internet – internet controlled by Google and the Big Corporatocracy, including the pharmaceuticals, will logically advise you against using them. At best they will tell you that these products or methods have not proven effective, and at worst, that they may be harmful. Don’t believe it. None of these products or methods are harmful. Remember, some of them have been used as natural remedies for thousands of years. And remember, China has successfully come to grips with COVID-19, using some of these relatively simple and inexpensive medications.Unfortunately, few doctors are aware of these practical, simple and inexpensive remedies. They are safe and more often than not successful. The media, under pressure from the pharma giants and the compliant government agencies, have been requested to censoring such valuable information. The negligence or failure, to make such easily accessible remedies public knowledge is killing people.Now, let’s cut to the chase, to what’s behind it all – behind the extraordinary monstrous media propaganda hype that is bringing down the entire (western) world’s socioeconomic system, creating untold misery, famine, and death. A misery with suffering potentially by orders of magnitude worse than the Big Depression of 1928 / 1929 and the subsequent years.If anybody had any doubts up to now, where the virus originated, the truth was dropped surreptitiously, a slip of the tongue or on purpose, by Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, when he addressed the Nation on 21 March on COVID-19, he said, “This is not about retribution, we are in a live exercise here…”, meaning military exercise, or a war game.President Trump by Pompeo’s side was whispering, “you should have let us know”. Whatever that means. It’s hard to believe that Mr. Trump didn’t know. But these are the vagaries of American politics, even on a death-serious subject like the new coronavirus breakout. See here with a brief video. See this also.This live (military) exercise has unimaginable worldwide implications which may completely transform our lives. It’s economic warfare. Almost every country on this planet is on some kind of a lock-down, a quarantine of sorts for an as of yet undetermined period, with businesses closed, shops and restaurants shot, construction sites halted, people working from home if they can, being in the streets is forbidden, in many countries under police and military surveillance, with cases of people being beaten up and hand-cuffed, if they have no good explanation.The President Macron-inspired French police is especially known for its uncontrolled brutality fighting the Yellow Vests. They have already demonstrated their same despise for their fellow citizens, when they are in the streets, even food shopping, without a special permit.Borders are shot, airlines are grounded, tourism comes to a screeching halt, basically from one day to the other, stranded throughout the world. With a few exceptions, Germany and France are rare ones, they organize return flights for their citizens abroad. Otherwise, with uncertain flight departures, over-booked and over-crowded flights, the stranded tourists have hardly a chance to return home soon.The socioeconomic cost is astronomical. In the multi-quadrillion, or quintillion; numbers with so many zeros they make you dizzy. This calamity can only partly be valued with numbers, and not now, as the world’s lock-down continues – with a social cost that cannot be valued. The dive of the stock market by about 30% – a typical bonanza for forward speculators and Big Finance, Big Banking, with multi-trillion-dollar losses for the small investors.Millions, if not hundreds of millions of small and medium size businesses going broke, unemployment going rampant, in the hundreds of millions, throughout the world, and the poorest of the poor, especially in developing countries, who are either unemployed or survive on small hourly or day-to-day jobs – they have no income, cannot buy the basics for survival – some of them may die from famine, others may commit suicide, others convert to crime. This is Greece by a factor of thousand, or worse.Then, there is a moral and societal breakdown from a forced quarantine, for which there is no clear end in sight. This creates fear and anxieties, frustration and anger.  For many it’s like solitary confinement – all of which is bad for health, and lowers the immune defense system. Just what those who pull the strings want.So, whom does this live (military) exercise serve? – First one would assume its destined to break China’s back, as China is the up-and-coming economic power. It is true, China’s economy has suffered enormously, with about 60% to 70% of all production stopped for the first two months this year, the time of the COVID-19 outbreak and peak, meaning a significant plunge of China’s GDP, maybe as much as 40% for January and February 2020.However, China has the corona virus now firmly under control. And China being China, her economy is recovering fast and may soon be back to what it was in December 2019. In fact, despite the significant impact of COVID-19, China’s economy may soon overtake that of the self-styled empire, the United States of America. China’s currency the yuan, is solidly backed by a strong economy and by gold, and is slated to become the world’s chief reserve currency, replacing the US-dollar, which had that role for the last 100 years. When that happens, the US hegemony is doomed.It goes without saying, our monetary system is planned to be fully electronic, no more cash – cash is poison – or as WHO’s Director General recently warned, not verbatim, but with that meaning, cash is dangerous for infections, paper money and coins may carry deadly viruses – thereby paving the way for full digitization of our monetary system. This has, indeed, already been tested over the past few years, mainly in Scandinavian countries, where entire department stores refuse to accept cash. In response to the WHO DG’s recommendation, some shops and restaurants in Germany refuse to accept cash.The universal vaccination and electronic ID go together and will first be tested in a few developing countries. Bangladesh is one of them. The vaccination program is the platform for the mega-changes the New World Order (NOW), or the One World Order (OWO) wants to bring about. This, in addition to the enormous money-making bonanza.An almost unknown agency called Agenda ID2020 is behind all this, monitoring, directing and adjusting the implementation of the various programs – that are supposed to eventually lead to Full Spectrum Dominance. For more details, see also the recent article on the dangers of Agenda ID2020.Behind this elaborate and complex network of things, appears time and again, one prominent name: Bill Gates, the Bill and Melinda Gate’s Foundation. Bill Gates has been funding vaccination programs in Africa for decades. And Bill Gates and the Rockefellers make no secret that one of their ultimate goal for planet earth is a drastic population reduction.Abstract of Agenda ID2020.Agenda ID2020 – is an alliance of public-private partners, including UN agencies and civil society. It’s an electronic ID program that uses generalized vaccination as a platform for digital identity. The program harnesses existing birth registration and vaccination operations to provide newborns with a portable and persistent biometrically-linked digital identity.GAVI, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, identifies itself on its website as a global health partnership of public and private sector organizations dedicated to “immunization for all”. GAVI is supported by WHO, and needless to say, its main partners and sponsors are the pharma-industry.The ID2020 Alliance at their 2019 Summit, entitled “Rising to the Good ID Challenge”, in September 2019 in New York, decided to roll out their program in 2020, a decision confirmed by the WEF in January 2020 in Davos. Their digital identity program will be tested with the government of Bangladesh. GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, and “partners from academia and humanitarian relief” (as they call it), are part of the pioneer party.Is it just a coincidence that ID2020 is being rolled out at the onset of what WHO calls a Pandemic? – Or is a pandemic needed to ‘roll out’ the multiple devastating programs of ID2020?How the Vaccination Research and Production is supposed to work.How will this elaborate and complex business of creating vaccines and implementing vaccine campaign work? As most official activities that basically are government responsibilities are privatized and outsourced, they become complex, chaotic at times and inefficient. In the case of the west, the US pretends to take the lead, but will also assign responsibilities to European pharma-labs.The National Institute of Health (NIH) has overall responsibility for national health research and program implementation. NIH’s Director is Anthony Fauci. The Institute was created in 1955. Under NIH, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), one of 27 institutes, reporting to NIH, is responsible for vaccination programs. NIAD’s mission is to conduct basic and applied research to better understand, treat and prevent infectious, immunologic and allergic diseases. NIAD has outsourced the vaccination program to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).CEPI was formed by the WEF (World Economic Forum) in Davos in January 2017. It was founded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) and the London-based Welcome Trust, created in 1936, but including now as members several European countries and the European Union (EU). The BMGF made a first infusion to CEPI of US$ 460 million. CEPI also receives funding from Norway and India and is also heavily supported by the pharma-industry.According to CEPI’s website, CEPI has appealed for US$ 2 billion to support the development of a vaccine for COVID-19 and to expand the number of vaccine candidates to increase the chances of success and to fund the clinical trials for these candidate vaccines. CEPI’s ambition is to have at least three vaccine candidates, which could be submitted to regulatory authorities for licensing for general use/use in outbreaks.“Governments around the world will need to invest billions of euros more in coronavirus vaccine development, to take forward some promising candidates that are emerging.  – It’s a very risky business – everything is being done in parallel, you’re not building on the expertise of others – but good progress is being made,” said Melanie Saville, director of vaccine research and development at CEPI.CEPI has already some preselected international pharma corporations to research and work on a COVID-19 vaccine. They include the biotech “Moderna” in Seattle, not far from the Microsoft Headquarters – also a Bill Gates creation; the biotech lab Inovio, the University of Queensland, Australia, and the Germans, BioNTech and CureVac.rom the outset it looks that Moderna, CureVac and BioNTech are best suited to produce fast a vaccine, because according to a Health and Science report, published on March 17, 2020, “all three of these firms specialize in messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics. These mRNA molecules are used to instruct the body to produce its own immune response to fight a range of different diseases. This type of vaccine can potentially be developed and produced more quickly than traditional vaccines.”Enters GAVI – the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization has also been created by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It is a global health partnership of public and private sector organizations, dedicated to “immunization for all”. GAVI is supported by WHO, and needless to say, its main partners and sponsors are the pharma-industry. GAVI has already announced it needs billions of dollars to support its COVID-19 vaccination program. In June 2020, the UK Government will sponsor a donor conference in support of GAVI’s COVID-19 vaccination program, expecting to raise US$ 7.3 billion.From this maze of overlapping organizations, activities and unclear responsibilities, the money-flow is likely going to be a crisscross that nobody can follow. Accountability on a large scale will be lost.As to the output – hopefully a vaccine – or several vaccines. For the layman and potential patient, it will be a matter of luck (or bad luck) what cocktail of biological substances will be injected into his or her body. In any case, the long-term outcome, is unpredictable. Remember, Bill Gates has been pursuing during the last fifteen or twenty years his own very special agenda. It is unlikely he will abandon it now. Rather COVID-19 and the ensuing vaccination program will allow him to enhance it.Concluding – it is amply clear that this is a huge money-making and public-rip-off proposition by the pharma industry. What makes this multi-billion-dollar scam even worse, is that it has an official rubber-stamp, by being supported by western governments and international organizations, foremost WHO, UNICEF and the World Bank.This may be the last opportunity for the elite, the 0.1%, to shuffle social capital and worker funded assets from the bottom to the top, before we enter an era of total control through electromagnetic fields (EMF), managed by the minions of the 0.1% and with 5G / 6G technology, where we, the remaining humans may have become mere tele-guided robots.It is by now a pipe dream to believe that the world may continue as it did until the end of the last decade. It would be too much of a coincidence that Agenda ID2020 started activating its evil programs exactly at the beginning of the decade 2020. Unfortunately, it is also a far-away dream that China and Cuba could lead the way for finding a cure for the most likely recurring coronavirus in one mutation or another – including but not exclusively, using traditional methods and remedies that have proven successful in the current battle to control COVID-19.There are draconian measures on the way, and we may just pray that they fail, or that we, the people, awake in time and in sufficient numbers – a critical mass – and find back to our innermost voice and soul – solidarity for each other that gives us strength to fight this Luciferian monster.\n",

      "Washington benefits from new SARS unsettling major competitors. Prior to the advent of the 2019-nCoV coronavirus, the so-called “first package” of the US-China trade agreement, which was signed on behalf of the Celestial Empire by Vice-Premier of the State Council of the PRC Liu He, was a tactical move that would allow China to take a break. And there is the presidential election in the United States, and it remains to be seen whether Donald Trump will be able to gain a foothold in the Oval Office for a second term ... But it looks like a malicious virus that has matured either in the stomachs of bats or in a snake’s gut has confused all the cards to a friend Xi Jinping.Against the background of alarming reports from the Chinese province of Hubei (when this material was being prepared, more than 4.5 thousand people fell ill with pneumonia, and 106 died, and these are not final numbers. - Auth.) Copper and iron ore prices collapsed.Copper cheaper ten days in a row, and yesterday the price fell by 1.5% - up to 5834.5 dollars per ton. Iron ore futures are falling in price, on Tuesday at the Singapore auction they offered 85 dollars per ton - a decrease of 6.4%. But, as Bloomberg predicts, $ 80 per tonne is not such a distant prospect. Prices for black gold also plummeted - April futures for the North Sea Brent oil mix were already trading below $ 58 per barrel.At the same time, the Fitch rating agency cautiously reports that the spread of coronavirus will first of all have a negative impact on the economies of Thailand, Vietnam and Singapore, since in these countries the most vulnerable regions to the epidemics are tourism and the service sector. The statement is indisputable - everyone will get it, and yet China, presumably, is more than others, since it is the Chinese economy that is the main consumer of both metals and energy resources, and tourism with services is not the last source of replenishment of the treasury. And since the prices of these goods went down, the Chinese economy also caught the “virus”. And it’s easier to negotiate with a “sick” client, which is well known even without Trump.It is noteworthy that 2019-nCoV got to the American technological giant Apple, whose production facilities are located just 500 kilometers from the “homeland” of the coronavirus - the Wuhan metropolis. And now, according to the Nikkei Asian Review, the production of popular iPhone smartphones is in jeopardy. Starbucks also found itself in a difficult situation, which, due to quarantine, had to close a large half of its four thousand coffee houses operating in China (by the way, this is the second largest market after the United States). But at the same time, the Americans for some reason do not look like such victims of the epidemic, especially Apple, whose leadership at the very beginning of the trade and economic confrontation with China advised to evacuate production facilities in the United States. It seems as if President Trump saw everything in advance, like Wolf Messing or old Wang. However, both Apple and Starbucks were really out of luck. You can’t say the same about the American political establishment, which is making titanic efforts to bring to its knees the \"presumptuous China.\" And why should these efforts necessarily be economic in nature? The main question is - who benefits from another SARS unsettling a competitor? If we apply the well-known trick highly likely, unceremoniously used by the British ex-prime minister Theresa May to hang the so-called Skripals poisoning in Russia, then the answer is obvious: the coronavirus epidemic 2019-nCoV, which hit China, is highly likely on the hand of the United States. And the worse for Beijing, the better for Washington. Moreover, the outlook for the epidemic is not yet encouraging. For example, some experts argue: if the spread of 2019-nCoV cannot be stopped, up to 250 million Chinese can become victims of the virus, which is almost two in number in Russia.By the way, about the prospects. The Cepi Global Vaccine Coalition has reportedly invested a total of $ 12.5 million in three projects, in which researchers are ready to expeditiously develop the 2019-nCoV vaccine.Scientists from the Australian University of Queensland, as well as two American biotechnology companies Inovio and Moderna, participate in the work. The American National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is also involved. And it seems that microbiologists from Hong Kong have already developed a vaccine against the new coronavirus, as Professor of Hong Kong University Ewan Kwok-Jung hastened to inform the newspaper South China Morning Post. But her research, he claims, could take more than a year. German Shipulin, the deputy director of the Center for Strategic Planning of the Russian Ministry of Health, does not promise an imminent victory over 2019-nCoV. So the hands of the coronavirus 2019-nCoV can be considered as yet untied, and there are suspicions that the United States may be involved in this epidemic. In the Russian media, this assumption has already been made.\n",
      "US operations as part of a biological warfare against the entire planet.As a result of the dengue epidemic in Cuba from 1978-1981, up to 500 thousand people were affected. Fidel Castro said this was the result of an American biological attack. Washington did not confirm or refute the allegations of the Cuban leader.Pentagon bio laboratories exist in 25 countries around the world. They are funded by the Military Threat Reduction Agency under a $ 2.1 billion military program. The joint biological interaction program includes laboratories located in the countries of the former Soviet Union, such as Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, as well as in the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Africa. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.By the location of these biological laboratories, we can confidently indicate the four countries and territories against which the American biological threats are now directed, these are Russia, Iran, China and the countries of Central and West Africa. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.The American company CH2M Hill, under contracts for the Pentagon bio-laboratories in Georgia, Uganda, Tanzania, Iraq, Afghanistan, Southeast Asia, was funded in the amount of $ 341.5 million. Of this amount, almost half ($ 161.1 million) was allocated for research in Lugar Center in Tbilisi. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.Its subcontractor, the private company Battelle, has worked in Pentagon bio labs in Afghanistan, Armenia, Georgia, Uganda, Tanzania, Iraq, Afghanistan and Vietnam. Battelle conducts research, development, testing and evaluation of the use of both highly toxic chemicals and highly pathogenic biological agents for a wide range of US government agencies. The company entered into federal contracts totaling $ 2 billion and ranks 23rd in the list of 100 best US state contractors. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.The Pentagon has a very long history of using insects as carriers of disease. According to a partially declassified US Army report of 1981, American scientists conducted a series of experiments on insects. These operations were part of the US Entomological War as part of a biological weapons program. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.The report reported two scenarios: 16 simultaneous attacks on the city by A. Aegypti mosquitoes infected with yellow fever, as well as Tularemia aerosol attack, and assessed their effectiveness in cash and loss of life. The results were very cynical. Pentagon experts were able to \"kill\" 625 thousand people at a cost of $ 0.29 per unit. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.Operation Big Itch: Field trials were carried out to determine the coverage and survivability of tropical rat fleas Xenopsylla cheopis for use as a disease carrier in biological warfare. In Ashington neither confirmed nor refuted this information.Operation Big Buzz: 1 million A. Aegypti mosquitoes were raised. One third of them were placed in ammunition, dropped from aircraft and scattered on the ground. Mosquitoes survived in the air and actively sought human blood. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.Operations on military experiments with tropical mosquitoes and ticks in Georgia. These types of mosquitoes and fleas (which were studied in the past as part of the US Entomological War Program) were imported into Georgia and tested at the Lugar Center. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.Anthrax is one of the biological agents in service with the US Army, not only in the past. Despite Pentagon claims that this program is only defensive, there are facts to the contrary. In 2016, at the Lugar Center, American scientists conducted the study “Genome Sequence of the Soviet / Russian Bacillus anthracis Vaccine Strain 55-VNIIVViM” (the sequence of the Soviet / Russian anthracite cancer vaccine in Russia), which was funded by the US Agency for Biological Weapons Sharing Program Threat Reduction (DTRA) in Tbilisi, and implemented by Metabiota. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is caused by the tick-borne virus Nairovirus (Nairovirus). The disease was first described in Crimea in 1944 and was called Crimean hemorrhagic fever. Later, it caused an epidemic in the Congo in 1969. In 2014, 34 people were infected with the CCHF, including a 4-year-old child, three of whom died. Pentagon biologists are currently studying the virus in Georgia as part of the DTRA project, Epidemiology of febrile illnesses caused by Dengue viruses and other Arboviruses in Georgia. The project included trials on patients with fever symptoms and collection of ticks as possible distributors of CCHV for laboratory analysis. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.Similar CCHV outbreaks occurred in Afghanistan, where there are 3 Pentagon bio labs. As of December 2017, 237 cases of CCHV were reported in this country, 41 of which were fatal. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.Bats are also being investigated as a carrier of various diseases at the Lugar Center, which scientists say are carriers of the Ebola virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and other deadly diseases. As of June 2017, 1980 cases were recorded with 699 deaths in 19 countries worldwide caused by MERS-CoV. This virus is designed and manufactured in the USA. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.Another weapon of bioterrorism is, according to a 1981 US Army report, Tularemia developed in the USA, or Rabbit Fever. New tularemia carriers, such as ticks and rodents, are currently being developed. DTRA has launched a number of projects on Tularemia and in Georgia at the Lugar Center. Highly pathogenic agents (EDP) can be used for military purposes. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.\n",
      "Ukraine itself does not have control over military biological laboratories on its territory. Under the 2005 Agreement between the US Department of Defense and the Department of Health of Ukraine, the Ukrainian government is prohibited from publicly disclosing confidential information about the US program. Ukraine is also required to transfer all dangerous pathogens to the US Department of Defense for biological research. Under this Agreement, the Pentagon was granted access to many state secrets of Ukraine. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.The Pentagon has invested at least $ 65 million in gene editing research. The U.S. Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has provided seven research teams to develop tools for altering the genome of insects, rodents, and bacteria through the DARPA Safe Gene program using new CRISPR-Cas9 technology. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.The worst biological weapon that may have already been used and possibly used in Russia is, again, perhaps used against the “enemy” of the USA - China. Until recently, ethnic biological weapons (biogenetic weapons) were theoretical weapons, the purpose of which is, first of all, to harm people of certain ethnic groups or genotypes (Russians, Chinese, etc.). Although officially the research and development of ethnic bio-weapons has never been publicly confirmed, documents show that the United States collects biological materials from certain ethnic groups - Russians and Chinese. American National Socialism in its purest form.US Air Force specifically collects samples of Russian DNA and synovial tissue, which causes concern in Moscow about a hidden American program for the use of biological weapons.Senator Franz Klintsevich commented on the words of President Vladimir Putin about the purposeful collection of Russian biomaterial: “In the West, everything is done very scrupulously and verified to the smallest detail: if we use biological weapons, then surely ... The relevant services in the West should know that we are aware of their interest. Let those who are engaged in this work on the territory of the Russian Federation not be offended. ”And it cannot be said that such suspicions have no reason. As you know, the United States ratified the Geneva Protocol and the Biological Weapons Convention back in 1975. But the biological games overseas have not stopped, and not only in the national territory. Already after the collapse of the USSR, American biological laboratories appeared, which is precisely established in Georgia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan. Where else - except that the State Department knows that it is, they say, absolutely peaceful organizations involved in the development of medicines. But if they are so peaceful, then why, one wonders, did the Americans build them not at home, but at the other end of the world?And the participants of the “visiting” American biological project are very specialized. For example, the US Army Institute of Infectious Disease Medical Research (USAMRIID, Fort Detrick), the Military Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), which is a division of the Pentagon, the Central Asian and Caucasian Biosafety Association, which monitors the biological potential of the CIS countries, the Biological Threat Reduction Program (Nunn-Lugar program) and so on.Comments, as they say, are unnecessary. Not so long ago, the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation analyzed documents on the activities of the so-called \"health center\" that the Americans built in Georgia, and came to the conclusion: in fact, this is a \"death factory\", which killed 73 people who were used by overseas biologists as experimental rabbits. But the fact of the matter is that American bio-laboratories are scattered not only around Russia, but also around the world, where America has its own interests.And another question, where did the 2019-nCoV coronavirus originate - in a bat or in some American \"health center\"? Where is it more highly likely?Coronavirus: US biological warfare against Russia and China\n",

      "Last year a mysterious shipment was caught smuggling Coronavirus from Canada. It was traced to Chinese agents working at a Canadian lab. Subsequent investigation by GreatGameIndia linked the agents to Chinese Biological Warfare Program from where the virus is suspected to have leaked causing the Wuhan Coronavirus outbreak.On June 13, 2012 a 60-year-old Saudi man was admitted to a private hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, with a 7-day history of fever, cough, expectoration, and shortness of breath. He had no history of cardiopulmonary or renal disease, was receiving no long-term medications, and did not smoke.Egyptian virologist Dr. Ali Mohamed Zaki isolated and identified a previously unknown coronavirus from his lungs. After routine diagnostics failed to identify the causative agent, Zaki contacted Ron Fouchier, a leading virologist at the Erasmus Medical Center (EMC) in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, for advice.Fouchier sequenced the virus from a sample sent by Zaki. Fouchier used a broad-spectrum “pan-coronavirus” real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method to test for distinguishing features of a number of known coronaviruses known to infect humans.This Coronavirus sample was acquired by Scientific Director Dr. Frank Plummer of Canada’s National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) in Winnipeg directly from Fouchier, who received it from Zaki. This virus was reportedly stolen from the Canadian lab by Chinese agents.The Canadian Lab. Coronavirus arrived at Canada’s NML Winnipeg facility on May 4, 2013 from the Dutch lab. The Canadian lab grew up stocks of the virus and used it to assess diagnostic tests being used in Canada. Winnipeg scientists worked to see which animal species can be infected with the new virus.Research was done in conjunction with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency’s national lab, the National Centre for Foreign Animal Diseases which is housed in the same complex as the National Microbiology Laboratory.NML has a long history of offering comprehensive testing services for coronaviruses. It isolated and provided the first genome sequence of the SARS coronavirus and identified another coronavirus NL63 in 2004.This Winnipeg based Canadian lab was targeted by Chinese agents in what could be termed as Biological Espionage.Chinese Biological Espionage. In March 2019, in mysterious event a shipment of exceptionally virulent viruses from Canada’s NML ended up in China. The event caused a major scandal with Bio-warfare experts questioning why Canada was sending lethal viruses to China. Scientists from NML said the highly lethal viruses were a potential bio-weapon.Following investigation, the incident was traced to Chinese agents working at NML. Four months later in July 2019, a group of Chinese virologists were forcibly dispatched from the Canadian National Microbiology Laboratory (NML). The NML is Canada’s only level-4 facility and one of only a few in North America equipped to handle the world’s deadliest diseases, including Ebola, SARS, Coronavirus, etc.The NML scientist who was escorted out of the Canadian lab along with her husband, another biologist, and members of her research team is believed to be a Chinese Bio-Warfare agent Xiangguo Qiu. Qiu was the head of the Vaccine Development and Antiviral Therapies Section in the Special Pathogens Program at Canada’s NML.Xiangguo Qiu is an outstanding Chinese scientist born in Tianjin. She primarily received her medical doctor degree from Hebei Medical University in China in 1985 and came to Canada for graduate studies in 1996. Later on, she was affiliated with the Institute of Cell Biology and the Department of Pediatrics and Child Health of the University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, not engaged with studying pathogens.But a shift took place, somehow. Since 2006, she has been studying powerful viruses in Canada’s NML. The viruses shipped from the NML to China were studied by her in 2014, for instance (together with the viruses Machupo, Junin, Rift Valley Fever, Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever and Hendra).Infiltrating the Canadian Lab.Dr. Xiangguo Qiu is married to another Chinese scientist – Dr. Keding Cheng, also affiliated with the NML, specifically the “Science and Technology Core”. Dr. Cheng is primarily a bacteriologist who shifted to virology. The couple is responsible for infiltrating Canada’s NML with many Chinese agents as students from a range of Chinese scientific facilities directly tied to China’s Biological Warfare Program, namely:Institute of Military Veterinary, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Changchun. Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Chengdu Military Region. Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hubei. Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing. All of the above four mentioned Chinese Biological Warfare facilities collaborated with Dr. Xiangguo Qiu within the context of Ebola virus, the Institute of Military Veterinary joined a study on the Rift Valley fever virus too, while the Institute of Microbiology joined a study on Marburg virus. Noticeably, the drug used in the latter study – Favipiravir – has been earlier tested successfully by the Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences, with the designation JK-05 (originally a Japanese patent registered in China already in 2006), against Ebola and additional viruses.However, the studies by Dr. Qiu are considerably more advanced and apparently vital for the Chinese biological weapons development in case Coronavirus, Ebola, Nipah, Marburg or Rift Valley fever viruses are included therein.The Canadian investigation is ongoing and questions remain whether previous shipments to China of other viruses or other essential preparations, took place from 2006 to 2018, one way or another.Dr. Xiangguo Qiu also collaborated in 2018 with three scientists from the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, Maryland, studying post-exposure immunotherapy for two Ebola viruses and Marburg virus in monkeys; a study supported by the US Defense Threat Reduction Agency.The Wuhan Coronavirus.Dr. Xiangguo Qiu made at least five trips over the school year 2017-18 to the above mentioned Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which was certified for BSL4 in January 2017. Moreover, in August 2017, the National Health Commission of China approved research activities involving Ebola, Nipah, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses at the Wuhan facility.Coincidentally, the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory is located only 20 miles away from the Huanan Seafood Market which is the epicenter of the Coronavirus outbreak dubbed the Wuhan Coronavirus.The Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory is housed at the Chinese military facility Wuhan Institute of Virology linked to China’s Biological Warfare Program. It was the first ever lab in the country designed to meet biosafety-level-4 (BSL-4) standards – the highest biohazard level, meaning that it would be qualified to handle the most dangerous pathogens. In January 2018, the lab was operational ‘for global experiments on BSL-4 pathogens,’ wrote Guizhen Wu in the journal Biosafety and Health. ‘After a laboratory leak incident of SARS in 2004, the former Ministry of Health of China initiated the construction of preservation laboratories for high-level pathogens such as SARS, coronavirus, and pandemic influenza virus,’ wrote Guizhen Wu.Coronavirus Bioweapon.The Wuhan institute has studied coronaviruses in the past, including the strain that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, H5N1 influenza virus, Japanese encephalitis, and dengue. Researchers at the institute also studied the germ that causes anthrax – a biological agent once developed in Russia.“Coronaviruses (particularly SARS) have been studied in the institute and are probably held therein,” said Dany Shoham, a former Israeli military intelligence officer who has studied Chinese biowarfare. He said. “SARS is included within the Chinese BW program, at large, and is dealt with in several pertinent facilities.”James Giordano, a neurology professor at Georgetown University and senior fellow in Biowarfare at the U.S. Special Operations Command, said China’s growing investment in bio-science, looser ethics around gene-editing and other cutting-edge technology and integration between government and academia raise the spectre of such pathogens being weaponized. That could mean an offensive agent, or a modified germ let loose by proxies, for which only China has the treatment or vaccine. “This is not warfare, per se,” he said. “But what it’s doing is leveraging the capability to act as global saviour, which then creates various levels of macro and micro economic and bio-power dependencies.”China’s Biological Warfare Program.In a 2015 academic paper, Shoham – of Bar-Ilan’s Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies – asserts that more than 40 Chinese facilities are involved in bio-weapon production.China’s Academy of Military Medical Sciences actually developed an Ebola drug – called JK-05 — but little has been divulged about it or the defence facility’s possession of the virus, prompting speculation its Ebola cells are part of China’s bio-warfare arsenal, Shoham told the National Post.Ebola is classified as a “category A” bioterrorism agent by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, meaning it could be easily transmitted from person to person, would result in high death rates and “might cause panic.” The CDC lists Nipah as a category C substance, a deadly emerging pathogen that could be engineered for mass dissemination.China’s Biological Warfare Program is believed to be in an advanced stage that includes research and development, production and weaponization capabilities. Its current inventory is believed to include the full range of traditional chemical and biological agents with a wide variety of delivery systems including artillery rockets, aerial bombs, sprayers, and short-range ballistic missiles.Weaponizing Biotech. China’s national strategy of military-civil fusion has highlighted biology as a priority, and the People’s Liberation Army could be at the forefront of expanding and exploiting this knowledge. The PLA is pursuing military applications for biology and looking into promising intersections with other disciplines, including brain science, supercomputing, and artificial intelligence. Since 2016, the Central Military Commission has funded projects on military brain science, advanced biomimetic systems, biological and biomimetic materials, human performance enhancement, and “new concept” biotechnology.In 2016, an AMMS doctoral researcher published a dissertation, “Research on the Evaluation of Human Performance Enhancement Technology,” which characterized CRISPR-Cas as one of three primary technologies that might boost troops’ combat effectiveness. The supporting research looked at the effectiveness of the drug Modafinil, which has applications in cognitive enhancement; and at transcranial magnetic stimulation, a type of brain stimulation, while also contending that the “great potential” of CRISPR-Cas as a “military deterrence technology in which China should “grasp the initiative” in development.In 2016, the potential strategic value of genetic information led the Chinese government to launch the National Genebank, which intends to become the world’s largest repository of such data. It aims to “develop and utilize China’s valuable genetic resources, safeguard national security in bioinformatics, and enhance China’s capability to seize the strategic commanding heights” in the domain of Biotechnology Warfare.Chinese military’s interest in biology as an emerging domain of warfare is guided by strategists who talk about potential “genetic weapons” and the possibility of a “bloodless victory.”\n",

      "THE STORY:The China Coronavirus COVID-19 rose to public attention late December 2019, but certain events October 2019 either planned for or precipitated it – such as the rollout of 5G in Wuhan.THE IMPLICATIONS:What is the coronavirus-5G connection? Is this bioweapon an excuse for mandatory vaccination, including DNA vaccines, which can be injected using a technique very similar to the EMF pulsed waves of 5G? The China Coronavirus 5G Connection is a very important factor when trying to comprehend the coronavirus (formerly abbreviated 2019-nCoV, now COVID-19) outbreak. Various independent researchers around the web, for around 2-3 weeks now, have highlighted the coronavirus-5G link despite the fact that Google (as the self-appointed NWO Censor-in-Chief) is doing its best to hide and scrub all search results showing the connection. The coronavirus 5G connection doesn’t mean the bioweapons connection is false (it’s not a case of either-or), but rather broadens the scope of the entire event. Wuhan was one of the test cities chosen for China 5G rollout; 5G went live there on October 31st, 2019, almost exactly 2 months before the coronavirus outbreak began. Meanwhile, many scientific documents on the health effects of 5G have verified that it causes flu-like symptoms. This article reveals the various connections behind the coronavirus phenomenon, including how 5G can exacerbate or cause the kind of illness you are attributing to the new virus. The rabbit hole is deep so let’s take a dive.5G – A Type of Directed Energy Weapon.For the deeper background to 5G, read my 2017 article 5G and IoT: Total Technological Control Grid Being Rolled Out Fast. Many people around the world, including concerned citizens, scientists and even governmental officials, are becoming aware of the danger of 5G. This is why it has already been banned in many places worldwide, such as Brussels, the Netherlands and parts of Switzerland, Ireland, Italy, Germany, the UK, the USA and Australia. After all, 5G is not just the next generation of mobile connectivity after 4G; it is a radical and entirely new type of technology – a military technology used on the battlefield that is now being ‘deployed’ (military term) in the civilian realm. It is phased array weaponry being sold and disguised as primarily a communications system when the frequency bands it uses (24GHz – 100+GHz including MMW [millimeter waves]) are the very same ones used in Active Denial Systems, i.e. crowd control. Even mainstream Wikipedia describes Active Denial Systems as directed energy weaponry; it disperses crowds by firing energy at them, causing immediate and intense pain, including a sensation of the skin burning. Remember, directed energy weapons (DEW) are behind the fall of the Twin Towers on 9/11 and the fake Californian ‘wildfires’.Numerous scientists have warned of the dangerous health effects of 5G. For instance, in this 5G Appeal from 2017 entitled Scientists and Doctors Warn of Potential Serious Health Effects of 5G, scientists warned of the harmful of non-ionizing RF/EMF radiation:If you listen to Mark Steele and Barrie Trower, you’ll get an idea of the horrifying effects of 5G. In this interview, Trower echoes the above quote by stating how 5G damages the immune system of trees and kills insects. He reveals how in 1977, 5G was tested on animals in hopes of finding a weapon. The results were severe demyelination – stripping the protective sheath of nerve cells. Some nations are now noticing a 90% loss of insects (including pollinating insects like bees) which congregate around lamp-posts where 5G is installed. \n",
      "Wuhan Military Games and Event 201 Simulation.If you dig deep enough, some disturbing connections arise between 5G and the men who have developed or are developing vaccines for novel viruses like ebola, zika and the new coronavirus COVID-19. In a fantastic piece of research, an author under the pen name of Annie Logical wrote the article Corona Virus Fakery And The Link To 5G Testing that lays out the coronavirus 5G connection. There is a ton of information, so I will break it all down to make it more understandable.From October 18-27th 2019, Wuhan hosted the Military World Games and specifically used 5G (for the first time ever) for the event. Also on October 18th, 2019 in New York, the Johns Hopkins Center in partnership with World Economic Forum (WEF) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation hosted Event 201 – “A Global Pandemic Exercise” which is a simulation of a pandemic. Guess what virus they happen to choose for their ‘simulation’? A coronavirus! Guess what animal cells they use? Pig cells! (COVID-19 was initially reported to be derived from a seafood market, and the fish there are known to be fed on pig waste). Event 201 includes the UN (since the WEF now has a partnership agreement with UN), Big Pharma (Johnson and Johnson), Bill Gates (key figure in pushing vaccines, human microchipping and Agenda 2030) and both China and America’s CDC. Participants in Event 201 recommended that governments force social media companies to stop the spread of ‘fake news’ and that ultimately the only way to control the information would be for the WHO (World Health Organization, part of the UN) to be the sole central purveyor of information during a pandemic.Inovio, Electroporation and 5G.As reported on January 24th, 2020, US biotech and pharmaceutical company Inovio received a $9 million grant to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus. Inovio got the money grant from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), however they already have an existing partnership with CEPI; in April 2018 they got up to $56 million to develop vaccines for Lassa Fever and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). CEPI was founded in Davos by the governments of Norway and India, the Wellcome Trust … and the participants of Event 201: the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the WEF. CEPI’s CEO is the former director of BARDA (US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority) which is part of the HHS. Inovio claimed they developed a coronavirus vaccine in 2 hours! On the face of it such a claim is absurd; what is more likely is that they are lying or that they already had the vaccine because they had the foreknowledge that the coronavirus was coming and was about to be unleashed.So who owns and runs Inovio? Two key men are David Weiner and Dr. Joseph Kim. Weiner was once Kim’s university professor. Weiner was involved with developing a vaccine for HIV and zika (you can read my articles about zika here and here where I exposed some of the lies surrounding that epidemic). Kim was funded by Merck (a large Big Pharma company) and produced something called Porcine Circovirus (PCV 1 and PCV 2). As mentioned above, there is a link between pig vaccines/pig DNA and the coronavirus; Annie Logical notes that it “has long been established that seafood in the area is fed on pig waste.” Kim served a 5-year tenure as a member of the WEF’s Global Agenda Council – yet another organ pushing the New World Order One World Government under the banner of Agenda 2030 Global Governance.Weiner is an employee and advisor to the FDA, is considered a DNA technology expert and pioneered a new DNA transference method called electroporation – a microbiology technique which uses an electrical pulse to create temporary pores in cell membranes through which substances like chemicals, drugs or DNA can be introduced into the cell. This technique can be used to administer DNA vaccines, which inject foreign DNA into a host’s cells that changes the host’s DNA. This means if you take a DNA vaccine, you are allowing your DNA to be changed! As if vaccines weren’t already horrific enough … but here’s the kicker: electroporation uses pulsed waves. Guess what else uses pulsed waves? 5G! This is either a startling coincidence or evidence or a sinister coronavirus 5G-connection. [T]he same action that 5G technology uses in pulsed waves and the coronavirus was reported to have started in an area in China that had rolled out 5G technology! So we can see how geneticists using scientists are tampering with the building blocks of our existence and what is disturbing is that Prof Wiener is a HIV pioneer and we know that soon after the Polio vaccines were given to millions in Africa that HIV emerged. They have perfected the art of injecting animal or bird DNA into human chromosomes which alters our DNA and causes things like haemorrhaging, fever, cancers and even death.”Speaking of HIV (which is not the same things as AIDS, but that is another story), remember also that a group of Indian scientists put out their research that the virus was manmade and had HIV inserts. They found that 4 separate HIV genes were randomly embedded within the coronavirus. These genes somehow converged to create receptor sites on the virus that were identical to HIV, which was a surprise due to their random placement. They also specifically stated that this was not likely to happen naturally (“unlikely to be fortuitous in nature”). In yet another example of egregious censorship, these scientists were pressured to withdraw their work.5G and Electroporation DNA Vaccines – Both Producing Pulsed EMF Waves. Consider the implications of this for a moment. The technology exists to use EMFs to open your very skin pores and inject foreign DNA into your bloodstream and cells. This is an extreme violation of your bodily sovereignty, and it can have long-term effects, because of genetic mutation – changing your very DNA which is the biological blueprint and physical essence of who you are.What if 5G mimics electroporation? What if 5G can do on a large scale what electroporation does on a small scale? We already know that 5G has the potential to be mutagenic (DNA-damaging). The frequencies that 5G uses, especially 75-100GHz, interact with the geometrical structure of our skin and sweat ducts, acting upon them like a transmission reaching an antenna, and fundamentally affecting us and our mood.What if 5G is being used to open up the skin of those in Wuhan so as to allow the new bioweapon coronavirus to infiltrate more easily?Mandatory Vaccines, Depopulation and Transhumanism.So, what’s at the bottom of the coronavirus-5G connection rabbit hole? I would suggest we find mandatory vaccine agenda, the depopulation agenda and transhumanist agenda (via DNA vaccines). The key figures and groups who appear to have planned this already have the vaccine in place, just as they did for the other epidemics that fizzled out (SARS, ebola and zika). Weiner even has links to HIV/AIDS, and if you dive into that as Jon Rappoport did, you find gaping holes in that story.It’s the same epidemic/pandemic game played out every 2-3 years. There’s a couple of versions. In the first version, you invent a virus, hype it up, get people scared, do ineffectual and inconclusive tests (e.g. like the PCR test which measures if a viral fragment is present but doesn’t tell you the quantities of whether it would actually causing the disease), inflate the body count, justify quarantine/martial law and brainwash people into thinking they have to buy the (toxic) vaccine and introduce mandatory vaccination. You don’t even need a real virus or pathogen for the version. In the second version, you create a virus as a bioweapon, release it as a test, pretend it was a natural mutation, watch how many people it kills (which helps with the eugenics and depopulation agendas), again justify martial law, again justify the need for mandatory vaccines and even pose as the savior with the vaccine that stops it. As a variation on this second version, you can even develop a race-specific bioweapon so as to reduce the population of rival nations or enemy races as a geopolitical strategy. This article suggests that the coronavirus targets Chinese people/Asians more than others, and certainly the official death count attests to that, although it’s always hard to trust governmental statistics. Annie Logical gives her take:The con job goes like this.poison the population purposely to create disease that does not and would never occur naturally. parlay the purposely created disease as being caused by something invisible, outside the realm of control or knowledge of the average person, create a toxic vaccine or medication that was always intended to further poison the population into an early grave. parlay the vaccine or medication poisoning as PROOF the disease, which never existed, is much worse than anticipated. increase the initial poisoning, which is marketed as a fake disease, and also increase the vaccine and medication poisoning, to start piling the bodies into the stratosphere. repeat as many times as possible upon an uninformed population because killing a population this way (the art of having people line up to kill themselves with poison……known as a “soft kill” method) is the only legal way to make sure such eugenic operations can be executed on mass and in plain sight.“DNA vaccines are a disturbing new advancement for transhumanism. After all, the objective of the transhumanist agenda is to merge man with machine, and in doing so, wipe out what fundamentally makes us human, so we can be controlled and overtaken by a deeply sinister and negative force. It’s all about changing us at the fundamental level, or attacking human sovereignty itself. DNA vaccines fit right in with that – literally changing your DNA by forcefully inserting foreign DNA to change your genetics, with consequences no one could possibly fully foresee and predict.One Last Coronavirus-5G Connection. Finally, I will finish with another coronavirus-5G connection. The word coronavirus itself refers to many kinds of viruses by that name, not just COVID-19. Guess who owns a patent for a coronavirus strain (not SARS CoV2 or COVID-19) that can be used to develop a vaccine? The Pirbright Institute.  And guess who partially owns them? Bill Gates! As you can read here Pirbright is being supported in their vaccine developement endeavors by a British company Innovate UK … who also funds and supports the rollout of 5G. Innovate UK ran a competition in 2018 with a £15 million share out to any small business that could produce vaccines for ‘epidemic’ potential.The Motivation to Hype and the Motivation to Downplay. History has shown that in cases of epidemics (or fake epidemics) there is almost always a morass of conflicting reports and contradictory information. In such situations, it can be very difficult to get to the bottom of the matter and find the truth. The conflict stems from the different motivations of nations, governments and other interested groups. Essentially, there are 2 main motivations: the motivation to hype (exaggerate and use fear to grab attention, sell something, make a group look bad/incompetent, make people scared, make the public accept mandatory vaccination and martial law) and the motivation to downplay (cover up and hide the true extent of the damage, morbidity or mortality so as to appear competent and in control, to lessen possible anger, backlash or disorder). Sometimes, these 2 motivations may drive the behavior of the same group, e.g. in the case of the Chinese Government, it has the motivation to hype (to get people afraid so they easily follow its draconian quarantine rules) and the motivation to downplay (so as to appear in the eyes of its people and the rest of the entire world to have the situation under control, to ensure saving face, credibility and a good reputation).\n",
      "Final Thoughts on the Coronavirus 5G Connection. Governments around the world have experimented with bioweapons both on their own citizens and foreign citizens, and even sold that research to other governments for their own benefit (e.g. Japan’s notorious Unit 731 which developed bioweapons in China, only to hand over that research to the US after losing World War 2). See Bioweapons: Lyme Disease, Weaponized Ticks, Plum Island & More for a brief history of the USG’s usage of weaponized ticks which resulted in Lyme Disease. The evidence that COVID-19 is a bioweapon is overwhelming – and so is the evidence that 5G is involved to either cause the flu-like symptoms/pneumonia people have been experiencing, and/or to exacerbate the virulence of the virus by weakening people’s immune systems and subjecting them to pulsed waves of EMF to open up their skin to foreign DNA fragments (including viruses).\n",

      "Francis Boyle, who for decades has advocated against the development and use of bioweapons, suspects COVID-19 is a weaponized pathogen that escaped from Wuhan City’s Biosafety Level 4 facility, which was specifically set up to research coronaviruses and SARS\n",
      "According to Boyle, the COVID-19 virus is a chimera. It includes SARS, an already weaponized coronavirus, along with HIV genetic material and possibly flu virus. It also has gain of function properties that allow it to spread a greater distance than normal\n",
      "The incubation period for COVID-19 infection is still unknown, but estimates range from 14 days to 30 days\n",
      "The U.S. government spent $100 billion on biological warfare programs since September 11, 2001, up until October 2015\n",
      "While there have so far only been a limited number of reported cases of COVID-19 infection in the U.S., the U.S. military has designated several detention sites around the country to quarantine Americans, should the situation take a turn for the worse. As you know, a novel coronavirus (initially labeled 2019-nCOV before being renamed COVID-19 by the World Health Organization1) originating in Wuhan City, Hubei Province in China, is rapidly spreading across the world.\n",
      "The first case was reported in Wuhan on December 21, 2019. Symptoms include fever, shortness of breath, severe cough and pneumonia which, in more severe cases, can lead to impaired kidney and liver function and kidney failure.On January 21, 2020, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the first U.S. case4 — a patient in Washington state who had recently visited Wuhan. Then, the first U.S. death was reported February 29, 2020, in Washington state.\n",
      "Less than a week later, CBS News reported March 5, 2020, that the number of deaths had quickly risen to 11 nationwide in the U.S. — 10 in Washington state and one in California.6 Not only that, but as of that day, “The World Health Organization urged governments around the world to pull out ‘all the stops’” to fight the outbreak. On the up side, China “appeared to be over the worst” of it, CBS said.All told, as of March 5, 2020, there were 98067 reported cases of novel coronavirus infections affecting 88 countries, 80430 of which were in China. Worldometer.info provides an easy overview of confirmed cases and deaths that you can check for the latest statistics.COVID-19 — A Weaponized Coronavirus?In this interview, Francis Boyle — whose background includes an undergraduate degree from the University of Chicago, a juris doctor (lawyer) degree from Harvard and a Ph.D. in political science — shares his theory of the origin of this novel coronavirus.For decades, he's advocated against the development and use of bioweapons, which he suspects COVID-19 is. In fact, Boyle was the one who called for biowarfare legislation at the Biological Weapons Convention of 1972, and the one who drafted the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989, which was passed unanimously by both houses of Congress and signed into law by George Bush, Sr.At the time of this recording, February 14, 2020, more than 50000 people in China had been infected with the virus. Certainly, it does not originate from infected bat soup.As a result of Boyle's antibiological warfare work, which goes back to the early days of the Reagan administration — a time in which they were using DNA genetic engineering to manufacture biological weapons — Boyle has carefully followed \"mysterious outbreaks of disease in both humans and animals around the world\" that have appeared since then.\"My biowarfare antiterrorism act was specifically designed to not only to deal with regular biological weapons but also with DNA genetic engineering for biological weapons that was just coming into its infancy when the BWC was being drafted.Even though the BWC would cover DNA genetic engineering, I wanted to make it clear by name that it was covered. I also made it clear [that] it covered synthetic biology as well,\" Boyle says.\"So, when these unexplained mysterious illnesses break out, I monitor them a while and usually I just conclude they can be explained by normal reasons: lack of sanitation, poverty, things of that nature. But in Wuhan it seemed pretty suspicious to me.There is this Biosafety Level 4 facility there in Wuhan. It's the first in China, and it was specifically set up to deal with the coronavirus and SARS. SARS is basically a weaponized version of the coronavirus.There have been leaks before of SARS out of this facility, and indeed the only reason for these BSL-4 facilities, based on my experience, is the research, development, testing and stockpiling of offensive biological weapons.For that reason, I stated my opinion: That this Wuhan coronavirus leaked out of that BSL-4 facility … maybe mid-November … and the Chinese government has been lying about it and covering up ever since.\"Many Unknowns Remain. The first reported case of COVID-19 infection was December 1, 2019. Depending on the incubation period, which is still unknown, the initial lead, provided there was one, might have occurred anywhere in November. The official estimate is a 14-day incubation period, but a British health expert believes it's 24 days, and North Korean biological warfare experts believe it's 30 days, Boyle says.\"As for Wuhan and Hubei Province, they're basically under martial law. There's no other word for it. If you read the statements by President Xi and his assistants, they've made it very clear they're at war here, and that is correct. They're at war with their own biological warfare agent.President Xi just fired the party apparatchiks in charge of this and has brought in trusted military personnel to handle it, as well as large numbers of PLA [People's Liberation Army] forces saying they're health care workers. They don't look like health care workers to me. So, as of now, that's my best reading of the situation.\"\n",
      "When asked about rumors the COVID-19 virus might have been stolen from a high-security laboratory in Winnipeg, Canada, Boyle says:\"It could have been. I want to make it clear that, in my opinion they were already working on that at the Wuhan BSL-4 facility. They were working on a biological warfare weapon involving SARS, which is a coronavirus to begin with.We do know that Dr. [Yoshihiro] Kawaoka at the University of Wisconsin … resurrected the Spanish flu virus for the Pentagon, obviously for weapons purposes, and he specializes in mating the Spanish flu virus to all sorts of hideous biowarfare instrumentalities. And there was a record of him shipping his products to Winnipeg.\n",
      "Winnipeg is Canada's equivalent of our own Fort Detrick. It's a BSL-4 facility, and yes, they research, develop tests, manufacture and stockpile every type of hideous biological warfare weapon that we know of. So, some of this technology could have been stolen from Winnipeg. I don't know about that but, as I said, the Wuhan BSL-4 was already working on this to begin with.They had already developed SARS. SARS had leaked out two to three times before this, and it seems they were turbocharging SARS, which is what [COVID-19] looks to be. This is a brand-new generation of biowarfare weapons we haven't seen before.Its lethality goes from 15%, as estimated by Lancet, up to 17% to 18% by a British health official and even Chinese statistics. Its infectivity is 83%. It can infect maybe three to four people for every person infected.It has gain of function properties, which means it travels through air at least 6 or 7 feet, and … there are reports that even contaminated human feces give it off, that the human feces radiate off maybe 6 or 7 feet. So, we've never seen anything like this before in the history of biological warfare, at least in the public record.\n",
      "I want to make it clear: I have never worked for the United States government. I've never had a security clearance. I've never had access to any type of secret information.I just read what is in the public record and the scientific record and try to draw my own conclusions, and that's what I'm giving you today. I could change my opinion if people can provide me reputable scientific evidence to the contrary.Right now, I'm standing by my conclusion that it leaked out of the Wuhan BSL-4, the highest level of the Chinese government has known about it, they've been covering it up from the get-go, until they informed the WHO at the end of December.\"Despite Laws, Biowarfare Experimentation Is Alive and Well. As noted by Boyle, the Wuhan lab is a designated WHO research lab, which may sound odd, considering these facilities specialize in developing and researching dangerous pathogens that can easily be turned into bioweapons. According to Boyle, we should not be surprised however, as \"WHO is up to its eyeballs in this type of work and has been for quite some time.\" The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the drug industry also appear to have had their hand in many of the outbreaks of what appear to be weaponized viruses.\n",
      "\"I won't go through the long history of big pharma getting involved in this. There's huge amounts of money here. I believe the West Africa Ebola pandemic originated out of the US BSL-4 facility in Sierra Leone, and [that] they were testing out a so-called vaccine that contained live Ebola and gave it to these poor people,\" Boyle says.\"As for the CDC, it has been involved in every … BSL-4 biological warfare death science you could possibly imagine … It's a matter of public record that during the Reagan administration, the CDC and the American Type Culture Collection sent 40 shipments of weapons-grade biological warfare agents to Saddam Hussein in Iraq, in the hope and expectation that he would weaponize these agents and use them against Iran.Of course, the problem is that when that war was over … an order was given to U.S. military forces to blow up Saddam Hussein's biological warfare facilities, and that's not how you deal with biological warfare weapons. [It] contaminated our own troops, and that was a causative factor in the Gulf War Syndrome that … murdered about 11000 U.S. troops and disabled about 100000.\"According to Boyle, the U.S. government spent $100 billion on biological warfare programs since September 11, 2011, up until October 2015, which is no small sum. To put it into perspective, the U.S. spent $40 billion (assuming a constant dollar value) on the Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bomb. Boyle also estimates the U.S. has some 13000 life scientists working within the biowarfare industry.\"Clearly, the Reagan administration, under the influence of its neoconservatives who definitely believe in biological weapons and ethnic-specific biological weapons (you can see that in the PNAC report), were engaged in the use of DNA genetic engineering for the purpose of manufacturing biological weapons.That is why I gave a Congressional briefing in Washington, D.C. in 1985. I was asked to do that by the Council for Responsible Genetics that I work with, which involves the leading life scientists in the world from MIT and Harvard.I spent seven years at Harvard. I have three degrees and I knew all these people. They asked me to serve as their lawyer and give this Congressional briefing. I blew the whistle, and then they asked me to draft the implementing legislation, which I did.I want to make it clear I'm not here to speak in their name, I'm only speaking in my name, but if you look at my book, 'Biological Warfare and Terrorism,' professor Jonathan King wrote the foreword. So, I have the leading MIT professor of molecular biology supporting what I'm saying, if you don't think I know enough science about it.\"US Prepares for COVID-19 Pandemic. While there have so far only been a limited number of reported cases of COVID-19 infection in the U.S., the U.S. military has designated several detention sites around the country to quarantine Americans,8 should the situation take a turn for the worse.Historically speaking, however, government health officials have been vastly exaggerating the threat of pandemics in the U.S., including the bird flu, the swine flu, anthrax and Ebola.For example, as detailed in my 2009 New York Times bestseller \"The Great Bird Flu Hoax,\" then-President George Bush Jr. projected 2 million Americans would die from bird flu; the best-case scenario taking only 200000 lives. The final death count in the U.S. from that pandemic was zero.It generated massive profits, though, as U.S. taxpayer dollars were used to purchase 20 million doses of Tamiflu. One of the people who was able to line his pockets from that hoax was defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who was president of Gilead Sciences when the drug was created.\"[The bird flu] was another DNA, genetically engineered biological warfare weapon,\" Boyle notes. \"It was a chimera. It had three different elements in it and we were all lucky that somehow they attenuated the lethality and the infectiveness of the bird flu.\"Whether or not COVID-19 will be similarly ineffective in its spread and lethality remains to be seen. Judging by the statistics in China, \"it doesn't look very good,\" Boyle says.Understanding the COVID-19 Virus. According to Boyle, the COVID-19 virus is a chimera, like the avian flu virus before it. It includes SARS, an already weaponized coronavirus, along with HIV genetic material. \"That was in a published article by Indian scientists. You could see the pictures right there, [but] political pressure was brought to bear upon them so they withdrew [the paper].\"This is why some scientists are now looking into using HIV drugs to treat it,9 Boyle says. COVID-19 may also have a flu virus mixed in, along with gain of function properties that allow it to spread a greater distance than normal.Pandemics Repeatedly Used to Further Police State. Pandemics have also been used to chip away public freedoms. For example, the anthrax scare of 2001 was used as the impetus for signing the Patriot Act, which was the first step in taking away many of our personal freedoms and rolling out a complete surveillance state. To me, such outcomes are far more concerning than the risk of infection itself. Boyle adds:\"They used Amerithrax to ram the Patriot Act through, that is correct … We became a police state … And as I pointed out in 'Biowarfare and Terrorism,' I think the same people who were behind the 9/11 terrorist attack were also behind the Amerithrax, but I'm just connecting dots there. What's called Amerithrax came out of a U.S. government biological warfare weapons lab and program, and I publicly blew the whistle on that the first weekend of November 2001.The Council for Responsible Genetics was having its convention at Harvard Business School and I was chairing a panel with King and other experts on biological warfare, on U.S. biological warfare programs.As I was walking into the Harvard Divinity School, Fox TV had a camera crew there and I said, 'Obviously, this came out a U.S. biological weapons program and probably Fort Detrick.'I conducted the session and made the same comment. Then I made a comment to a Washington, D.C., radio station to that effect [and to] the BBC, so everyone in the world heard me.At that point, someone gave an order that I was never to be interviewed again by any mainstream news about biological warfare programs. And that's been the case since the first week of November 2001.\"As noted by Boyle, George Orwell's book, \"1984,\" has become reality. Boyle has since lectured lawyers at DePaul Law School in Chicago about the totalitarian nature of the Patriot Act.\"Snowden has correctly pointed out the federal government is spying on everything we say, all of our electronic communications, you name it,\" Boyle says.\"And again, the proof is I've been completely blackballed out of U.S. media. Indeed, if you go back and look at the Amerithrax attacks, they also hit mainstream U.S. media to make it clear to them that if they covered this issue they will be killed too.\"Bioweapons Are Developed To Be Used. As noted by Boyle, the U.S. government has a large stockpile of Amerithrax — a super weapons-grade nanotechnology anthrax with 1 trillion spores per gram — and that's just the tip of the iceberg of the biological weapons developed. What's more, Boyle has no doubt these weapons will eventually be put to use, as they have in the past. He says:\"There was a tabletop exercise at John Hopkins University last fall … on coronavirus.10 Tabletop exercise, that's a euphemism for a war game. Their estimate was that it killed 65 million people11. John Hopkins is up to their eyeballs in this Nazi biological warfare dirty work. They have a BSL-3 facility there … that they proudly announce on their website … They justify it by saying they're developing vaccines. OK … How do they do that?They go out around the world, and this is a matter of public record, and scour for every type of hideous disease, fungus, virus and bacteria you can possibly imagine. They then bring it back to these BSL-4 labs and develop an offensive, biological agent using DNA genetic engineering and synthetic biology … set up by the Pentagon under DARPA. Once they have this offensive agent, they then proceed to develop a vaccine, because the agent is no good unless you can have a vaccine to protect your own people.So, they're developing vaccines to have biological weapons, because a biological weapon consists of two elements: the offensive biological warfare agent in the first place, and then, second, a vaccine to protect your own people, and that is what is being done at all these BSL-4 facilities, and many of the BSL-3s as well.John Hopkins has a BSL-3 and they admit they do dual use. That's what dual use means. They first develop the offensive biological warfare agent and then they develop the supposed vaccine.\"Indeed, Johns Hopkins University is the biggest recipient of research grants from federal agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation and Department of Defense. It has also received millions of dollars in research grants from the Gates Foundation.12 In 2016, Johns Hopkins spent more than $2 billion on research projects, leading all U.S. universities in research spending for the 38th year in a row.How Can We Best Prevent or Treat COVID-19 Infection?While it's unclear exactly which treatment is the most effective, my guess is that Dr. Paul Marik's intravenous vitamin C protocol for sepsis would be a good starting point, seeing how sepsis appears to be what kills those who succumb to a serious COVID-19 infection.Marik's retrospective before-after clinical study1415 showed that giving patients IV vitamin C with hydrocortisone and vitamin B1 for two days reduced mortality from 40% to 8.5%. The precise protocol used was 200 mg of thiamine every 12 hours, 1500 mg of ascorbic acid every six hours, and 50 mg of hydrocortisone every six hours.16 Importantly, the treatment has no side effects and is inexpensive, readily available and simple to administer.According to Marik, vitamin C and corticosteroids have a synergistic effect,17 which is part of why his combo protocol is so effective. Still, simply using high-dose IV vitamin C exclusively has been shown to improve survival in patients with sepsis and acute respiratory failure, reducing mortality from 46% to 30%.It also reduced the number of days they needed to remain hospitalized. On average, those who received vitamin C had by Day 28 spent three fewer days in the intensive care unit than the placebo group (seven days compared to 10). By Day 60, the treatment group had also spent seven fewer days in the hospital overall —15 days compared to 22.19. While there are no trials that look at integrating hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), my suspicion is that this would provide a powerful synergy that could get the fatality rate from sepsis even closer to zero. Sadly, HBOT is not available at many hospitals, and even if it were, it is not approved for sepsis.Bioweapons Expert Speaks Out About Novel Coronavirus\n",

      "Sponsored by RevcontentTrending Now. The China Coronavirus 5G Connection is a very important factor when trying to comprehend the coronavirus (formerly abbreviated 2019-nCoV, now COVID-19) outbreak. Various independent researchers around the web, for around 2-3 weeks now, have highlighted the coronavirus-5G link despite the fact that Google (as the self-appointed NWO Censor-in-Chief) is doing its best to hide and scrub all search results showing the connection. The coronavirus 5G connection doesn’t mean the bioweapons connection is false (it’s not a case of either-or), but rather broadens the scope of the entire event. Wuhan was one of the test cities chosen for China 5G rollout; 5G went live there on October 31st, 2019, almost exactly 2 months before the coronavirus outbreak began. Meanwhile, many scientific documents on the health effects of 5G have verified that it causes flu-like symptoms. This article reveals the various connections behind the coronavirus phenomenon, including how 5G can exacerbate or cause the kind of illness you are attributing to the new virus. The rabbit hole is deep so let’s take a dive. 5G – A Type Of Directed Energy Weapon\n",
      "For the deeper background to 5G, read my 2017 article 5G and IoT: Total Technological Control Grid Being Rolled Out Fast. Many people around the world, including concerned citizens, scientist and even governmental officials, are becoming aware of the danger of 5G. This is why it has already been banned in many places worldwide, such as Brussels, the Netherlands and parts of Switzerland, Ireland, Italy, Germany, the UK, the USA and Australia. After all, 5G is not just the next generation of mobile connectivity after 4G; it is a radical and entirely new type of technology – a military technology used on the battlefield that is now being ‘deployed’ (military term) in the civilian realm. It is phased array weaponry being sold and disguised as primarily a communications system when the frequency bands it uses (24GHz – 100+GHz including MMW [millimeter waves]) are the very same ones used in Active Denial Systems, i.e. crowd control. Even mainstream Wikipedia describes Active Denial Systems as directed energy weaponry; it disperses crowds by firing energy at them, causing immediate and intense pain, including a sensation of the skin burning. Remember, directed energy weapons (DEW) are behind the fall of the Twin Towers on 9/11 and the fake Californian ‘wildfires’. Numerous scientists have warned of the dangerous health effects of 5G. For instance, in this 5G Appeal from 2017 entitled Scientists and Doctors Warn of Potential Serious Health Effects of 5G, scientists warned of the harmful of non-ionizing RF/EMF radiation: “Effects include increased cancer risk, cellular stress, increase in harmful free radicals, genetic damages, structural and functional changes of the reproductive system, learning and memory deficits, neurological disorders, and negative impacts on general wellbeing in humans. Damage goes well beyond the human race, as there is growing evidence of harmful effects to both plants and animals.” If you listen to Mark Steele and Barrie Trower, you’ll get an idea of the horrifying effects of 5G. In this interview, Trower echoes the above quote by stating how 5G damages the immune system of trees and kills insects. He reveals how in 1977, 5G was tested on animals in hopes of finding a weapon. The results were severe demyelination – stripping the protective sheath of nerve cells. Some nations are now noticing a 90% loss of insects (including pollinating insects like bees) which congregate around lamp-posts where 5G is installed. Wuhan Military Games And Event 201 Simulation If you dig deep enough, some disturbing connections arise between 5G and the men who have developed or are developing vaccines for novel viruses like ebola, zika and the new coronavirus COVID-19. In a fantastic piece of research, an author under the pen name of Annie Logical wrote the article Corona Virus Fakery And The Link To 5G Testing that lays out the coronavirus 5G connection. There is a ton of information, so I will break it all down to make it more understandable. From October 18-27th 2019, Wuhan hosted the Military World Games and specifically used 5G (for the first time ever) for the event. Also on October 18th, 2019 in New York, the Johns Hopkins Center in partnership with World Economic Forum (WEF) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation hosted Event 201 – “A Global Pandemic Exercise” which is a simulation of a pandemic.Guess what virus they happen to choose for their ‘simulation’? A coronavirus! Guess what animal cells they use? Pig cells! (COVID-19 was initially reported to be derived from a seafood market, and the fish there are known to be fed on pig waste). Event 201 includes the UN (since the WEF now has a partnership agreement with UN), Big Pharma (Johnson and Johnson), Bill Gates (key figure in pushing vaccines, human microchipping and Agenda 2030) and both China and America’s CDC. Participants in Event 201 recommended that governments force social media companies to stop the spread of ‘fake news’ and that ultimately the only way to control the information would be for the WHO (World Health Organization, part of the UN) to be the sole central purveyor of information during a pandemic. Inovio, Electroporation And 5G As reported on January 24th, 2020, US biotech and pharmaceutical company Inovio received a $9 million grant to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus. Inovio got the money grant from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), however they already have an existing partnership with CEPI; in April 2018 they got up to $56 million to develop vaccines for Lassa Fever and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). CEPI was founded in Davos by the governments of Norway and India, the Wellcome Trust … and the participants of Event 201: the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the WEF. CEPI’s CEO is the former director of BARDA (US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority) which is part of the HHS. Inovio claimed they developed a coronavirus vaccine in 2 hours! On the face of it such a claim is absurd; what is more likely is that they are lying or that they already had the vaccine because they had the foreknowledge that the coronavirus was coming and was about to be unleashed. So who owns and runs Inovio? Two key men are David Weiner and Dr. Joseph Kim. Weiner was once Kim’s university professor. Weiner was involved with developing a vaccine for HIV and zika (you can read my articles about zika here and here where I exposed some of the lies surrounding that epidemic). Kim was funded by Merck (a large Big Pharma company) and produced something called Porcine Circovirus (PCV 1 and PCV 2). As mentioned above, there is a link between pig vaccines/pig DNA and the coronavirus; Annie Logical notes that it “has long been established that seafood in the area is fed on pig waste.” Kim served a 5-year tenure as a member of the WEF’s Global Agenda Council – yet another organ pushing the New World Order One World Government under the banner of Agenda 2030 Global Governance. Weiner is an employee and advisor to the FDA, is considered a DNA technology expert and pioneered a new DNA transference method called electroporation – a microbiology technique which uses an electrical pulse to create temporary pores in cell membranes through which substances like chemicals, drugs or DNA can be introduced into the cell. This technique can be used to administer DNA vaccines, which inject foreign DNA into a host’s cells that changes the host’s DNA. This means if you take a DNA vaccine, you are allowing your DNA to be changed! As if vaccines weren’t already horrific enough … but here’s the kicker: electroporation uses pulsed waves. Guess what else uses pulsed waves? 5G! This is either a startling coincidence or evidence or a sinister coronavirus 5G-connection. Annie writes:“. he same action that 5G technology uses in pulsed waves and the coronavirus was reported to have started in an area in China that had rolled out 5G technology! “So we can see how geneticists using scientists are tampering with the building blocks of our existence and what is disturbing is that Prof Wiener is a HIV pioneer and we know that soon after the Polio vaccines were given to millions in Africa that HIV emerged. They have perfected the art of injecting animal or bird DNA into human chromosomes which alters our DNA and causes things like haemorrhaging, fever, cancers and even death.”Speaking of HIV (which is not the same things as AIDS, but that is another story), remember also that a group of Indian scientists put out their research that the virus was manmade and had HIV inserts. They found that 4 separate HIV genes were randomly embedded within the coronavirus. These genes somehow converged to create receptor sites on the virus that were identical to HIV, which was a surprise due to their random placement. They also specifically stated that this was not likely to happen naturally (“unlikely to be fortuitous in nature”). In yet another example of egregious censorship, these scientists were pressured to withdraw their work. 5G And Electroporation DNA Vaccines – Both Producing Pulsed EMF Waves Consider the implications of this for a moment. The technology exists to use EMFs to open your very skin pores and inject foreign DNA into your bloodstream and cells. This is an extreme violation of your bodily sovereignty, and it can have long-term effects, because of genetic mutation – changing your very DNA which is the biological blueprint and physical essence of who you are. What if 5G mimics electroporation? What if 5G can do on a large scale what electroporation does on a small scale? We already know that 5G has the potential to be mutagenic (DNA-damaging). The frequencies that 5G uses, especially 75-100GHz, interact with the geometrical structure of our skin and sweat ducts, acting upon them like a transmission reaching an antenna, and fundamentally affecting us and our mood. What if 5G is being used to open up the skin of those in Wuhan so as to allow the new bioweapon coronavirus to infiltrate more easily? Mandatory Vaccines, Depopulation And Transhumanism So, what’s at the bottom of the coronavirus-5G connection rabbit hole? I would suggest we find mandatory vaccine agenda, the depopulation agenda and transhumanist agenda (via DNA vaccines). The key figures and groups who appear to have planned this already have the vaccine in place, just as they did for the other epidemics that fizzled out (SARS, ebola and zika). Weiner even has links to HIV/AIDS, and if you dive into that as Jon Rappoport did, you find gaping holes in that story. It’s the same epidemic / pandemic game played out every 2-3 years. There’s a couple of versions. In the first version, you invent a virus, hype it up, get people scared, do ineffectual and inconclusive tests (e.g. like the PCR test which measures if a viral fragment is present but doesn’t tell you the quantities of whether it would actually causing the disease), inflate the body count, justify quarantine/martial law and brainwash people into thinking they have to buy the (toxic) vaccine and introduce mandatory vaccination. You don’t even need a real virus or pathogen for the version. In the second version, you create a virus as a bioweapon, release it as a test, pretend it was a natural mutation, watch how many people it kills (which helps with the eugenics and depopulation agendas), again justify martial law, again justify the need for mandatory vaccines and even pose as the savior with the vaccine that stops it. As a variation on this second version, you can even develop a race-specific bioweapon so as to reduce the population of rival nations or enemy races as a geopolitical strategy. This article suggests that the coronavirus targets Chinese people / Asians more than others, and certainly the official death count attests to that, although it’s always hard to trust governmental statistics. Annie Logical gives her take: “The con job goes like this. Step 1) poison the population purposely to create disease that does not and would never occur naturally Step 2) parlay the purposely created disease as being caused by something invisible, outside the realm of control or knowledge of the average person Step 3) create a toxic vaccine or medication that was always intended to further poison the population into an early grave Step 4) parlay the vaccine or medication poisoning as PROOF the disease, which never existed, is much worse than anticipated Step 5) increase the initial poisoning, which is marketed as a fake disease, and also increase the vaccine and medication poisoning, to start piling the bodies into the stratosphere Step 6) repeat as many times as possible upon an uninformed population because killing a population this way (the art of having people line up to kill themselves with poison……known as a “soft kill” method) is the only legal way to make sure such eugenic operations can be executed on mass and in plain sight.“ DNA vaccines are a disturbing new advancement for transhumanism. After all, the objective of the transhumanist agenda is to merge man with machine, and in doing so, wipe out what fundamentally makes us human, so we can be controlled and overtaken by a deeply sinister and negative force. It’s all about changing us at the fundamental level, or attacking human sovereignty itself. DNA vaccines fit right in with that – literally changing your DNA by forcefully inserting foreign DNA to change your genetics, with consequences no one could possibly fully foresee and predict. One Last Coronavirus – 5G Connection Finally, I will finish with another coronavirus-5G connection. The word coronavirus itself refers to many kinds of viruses by that name, not just COVID-19. Guess who owns a patent for a coronavirus strain that can be used to develop a vaccine? The Pirbright Institute. And guess who partially owns them? Bill Gates! As you can read here Pirbright is being supported in their vaccine developement endeavors by a British company Innovate UK … who also funds and supports the rollout of 5G. Innovate UK ran a competition in 2018 with a £15 million share out to any small business that could produce vaccines for ‘epidemic’ potential.The Motivation To Hype And The Motivation To Downplay History has shown that in cases of epidemics (or fake epidemics) there is almost always a morass of conflicting reports and contradictory information. In such situations, it can be very difficult to get to the bottom of the matter and find the truth. The conflict stems from the different motivations of nations, governments and other interested groups. Essentially, there are 2 main motivations: the motivation to hype (exaggerate and use fear to grab attention, sell something, make a group look bad/incompetent, make people scared, make the public accept mandatory vaccination and martial law) and the motivation to downplay (cover up and hide the true extent of the damage, morbidity or mortality so as to appear competent and in control, to lessen possible anger, backlash or disorder). Sometimes, these 2 motivations may drive the behavior of the same group, e.g. in the case of the Chinese Government, it has the motivation to hype (to get people afraid so they easily follow its draconian quarantine rules) and the motivation to downplay (so as to appear in the eyes of its people and the rest of the entire world to have the situation under control, to ensure saving face, credibility and a good reputation). Final Thoughts On The Coronavirus 5G Connection. Governments around the world have experimented with bioweapons both on their own citizens and foreign citizens, and even sold that research to other governments for their own benefit (e.g. Japan’s notorious Unit 731 which developed bioweapons in China, only to hand over that research to the US after losing World War 2). See Bioweapons: Lyme Disease, Weaponized Ticks, Plum Island & More for a brief history of the USG’s usage of weaponized ticks which resulted in Lyme Disease. The evidence that COVID-19 is a bioweapon is overwhelming – and so is the evidence that 5G is involved to either cause the flu-like symptoms/pneumonia people have been experiencing, and/or to exacerbate the virulity of the virus by weakening people’s immune systems and subjecting them to pulsed waves of EMF to open up their skin to foreign DNA fragments (including viruses). In this kinds of story, there are no major coincidences – only connections and conspiracies waiting to be uncovered. You can learn more on the subject by reading the book “The Dark Side of Prenatal Ultrasound and the Dangers of Non-Ionizing Radiation“.There’s A Connection Between Coronavirus And 5G\n",

      "The hype and disinformation campaign about the spread of the new COVID-19 coronavirus has created a climate of fear and uncertainty around the world since WHO declared it a medical emergency. international public health on January 30. The fear campaign is underway, creating panic and uncertainty. National governments and WHO mislead the public.\"About 84000 people in at least 56 countries have been infected and about 2900 have died,\" said the New York Times. What the newspaper fails to mention is that 98% of infections are in mainland China. There are fewer than 5000 confirmed cases outside of China (WHO, February 28, 2020). At the moment, there is no real pandemic outside of mainland China. The numbers speak for themselves. At the time of this writing, the number of \"confirmed cases\" in the US is 64 .The number is minimal, but the media is spreading panic.There are however 15 million cases of influenza in the USA .The latest FluView surveillance report from the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicates that on January 18, 2020, there were 15 million influenza cases, 140000 hospitalizations and 8200 deaths in this influenza season in the USA (emphasis added ). COVID-19 Pandemic Data On February 28, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 83652 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 78961 in mainland China. Outside China, there were 4691 (WHO, February 28, 2020, see table on the right). WHO also reported 2791 deaths, including only 67 outside of mainland China .These figures confirm that the pandemic is mainly confined to mainland China. In addition, recent data tend to show that the epidemic in China is under control. On February 21, 2020, the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China reported that 36157 patients were declared cured and discharged from hospital (see chart below).Chinese reports confirm that people have received treatment and are recovering from the viral infection. The number of infected patients is also decreasing. According to the National Pharmaceutical Administration of China, hospitals use the antiviral drug Favilavir \"to treat coronavirus with minimal side effects\".Let's look at the numbers:The world population is around 7.8 billion people.The population of China is around 1.4 billion people.The world population minus China is around 6.4 billion people.4691 confirmed cases and 67 reported deaths (outside of China) out of a population of 6.4 billion do not constitute a pandemic. 4691 / 6400000000 = 0.00000073 = 0.000073%. In the USA, 64 cases out of a population of around 330 million do not constitute a pandemic. (data from February 28): 64 / 330000000 .Why propaganda? Racism against people of Chinese origin. A deliberate campaign against China has been launched and a wave of racist sentiments against people of Chinese origin is underway, largely peddled by the Western media.The Economist  reports that \"The coronavirus spreads racism against people of Chinese origin and also among themselves.\"Fear of covid-19 causes people to behave badly, including some Chinese.\"The Chinese community in Great Britain is facing racism because of the coronavirus epidemic\" according to the SCMP.“Chinese communities abroad are increasingly facing racist abuse and discrimination in the context of the coronavirus epidemic. Some people of Chinese origin living in the UK say they have been the victims of growing hostility due to the deadly virus from China.The New York Times reported on March 30 that President Trump backed down from his previous statement that by April 12, the COVID-19 lockout should be over and it's time to think about \" back to work \". Instead, he said an extension until the end of April was necessary - and perhaps even until June. This, he said, followed the advice of his advisers, including Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), within the National Institute for Health (NIH), The COVID-19 virus has so far caused far fewer infections and deaths than regular flu in recent years. The WHO reported on March 30, 750000 infections worldwide and 36000 deaths. In the United States, there are approximately 161000 cases and 3000 deaths. Yet whistleblower Fauci says there could be millions of cases of coronavirus in the United States and 100000 to 200000 deaths. And, coincidentally, Bill Gates does the same, using roughly the same numbers.\n",
      "All this with the idea of ​​imposing a vaccine on the population.A multi-billion dollar vaccine is not necessary.NIAD and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation are collaborating to develop a COVID-19 vaccine.China has shown that the COVID-19 virus can be brought under control at relatively low cost and with strict discipline and traditional medicines. The same drugs and measures have been used for centuries to successfully prevent and cure all kinds of viral diseases.First of all, a vaccine against COVID-19, or against coronaviruses in general, is a vaccine against influenza. Vaccines do not cure. Ideally, influenza vaccines can prevent the virus from affecting a patient as much as it would without a vaccine. The effectiveness of influenza vaccines is generally evaluated between 20 and 50%. Above all, vaccines are a huge financial bonus for large pharmaceutical companies.Then here are a multitude of remedies that have proven to be very effective. See also this and that.The French Professor Didier Raoult , which is one of the five best scientists in the world in the field of communicable diseases, has suggested the use of hydroxychloroquine ( Chloroquine or Plaquenil) , a well known drug, simple and low COVID-19: More Hydroxychloroquine Data From Francecost, also used to fight malaria, which has been shown to work with previous coronaviruses such as SARS. From mid-February 2020, clinical trials at his institute and in China have already confirmed that the drug can reduce viral load and bring a dramatic improvement. Chinese scientists have published their first trials on more than 100 patients and announced that the Chinese National Health Commission would recommend chloroquine in its new guidelines for the treatment of the COVID-19 virus.China and Cuba are collaborating on the use of interferon Alpha 2B, a highly effective antiviral drug developed in Cuba for 39 years, but little known to the world, due to the embargo imposed by the United States on everything which comes from Cuba. Interferon has also been shown to be very effective in the fight against COVID-19 and is now produced in a joint venture in China. There is an old natural Indian / Ayurvedic medicine, curcumin, which comes in the form of C90 capsules. It is an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compound that has been used successfully to treat cancer, infectious diseases and, yes, coronaviruses.\n",
      "Other simple but effective remedies include the use of large doses of vitamin C , as well as vitamin D3 , or more generally the use of essential micro-nutrients to fight infections, especially vitamins A, B, C, D summer. Another remedy used for thousands of years by the ancient Chinese, Romans and Egyptians is colloidal silver products. They come in the form of a liquid to be administered orally, or to be injected, or to be applied to the skin. Colloidal silver products strengthen the immune system, fight bacteria and viruses, and have been used to treat cancer, HIV / AIDS, shingles, herpes, eye conditions, prostatitis - and COVID-19.\n",
      "A simple and inexpensive remedy to use in combination with others is the menthol-based \"Mentholatum  \" . It is used for common flu and cold symptoms. Applied on and around the nose, it acts as a disinfectant and prevents germs from entering the respiratory tract, including coronaviruses.Northern Italy and New Orleans report that an unusual number of patients had China Is Using Cuba's Interferon Alfa 2B Against Coronavirus ...to be hospitalized in intensive care units (ICUs) and placed on a 24-hour, 7-day-a-day ventilator %, some of them not reacting and falling into respiratory failure. The reported mortality rate is around 40%. This condition is called acute respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS. This means that the lungs are filled with fluid. When this description of ARDS episodes applies, Dr. Raoult and other medical colleagues recommend COVID-19 patients to \"sleep sit\" until they are cured. This allows the fluid to escape from the lungs. This method has been known for its effectiveness since it was first documented during the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic.Finally, Chinese researchers, in cooperation with Cuban and Russian scientists, are also developing a vaccine that may soon be ready for testing. This vaccine would attempt to attack not only a single strand of coronavirus, but also the basic genome of coronaviral RNA (RNA = ribonucleic acid), to prevent new mutations in coronaviruses. Unlike the West, which works exclusively for profit, the Sino-Cuban-Russian vaccine would be made available to the whole world at a low price.These alternative remedies cannot be found on the internet controlled by the major pharmaceutical companies. Internet references, if any, may discourage their use. At best, they will tell you that these products or methods have not proven to be effective, and at worst, that they can be harmful. Don't believe it. None of these products or methods are harmful. Remember that some of them have been used as natural remedies for thousands of years. And don't forget that China has successfully mastered COVID-19, using some of these relatively simple and inexpensive drugs.Few doctors know these practical, simple and inexpensive remedies. The media, under pressure from giants of the pharmaceutical industry and government agencies that comply with it, were asked to censor this valuable information. Neglect or inability to publicize these readily available remedies takes their toll.The role of Bill Gates and locking. Bill Gates may have been one of Trump's \"advisers\", suggesting that he extend the \"return to work\" date at least until the end of April, and, if Gates wants it, at least until in June. It remains to be seen. Gates is very - very powerful:Bill Gates Says US Has Missed Chance to Avoid Coronavirus Closure and Businesses Should Stay Closed. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation will be the source of the organization of mass vaccination which should be launched in the period following containment.The vaccination association includes the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations ( CEPI ), a semi-NGO, to which NIH / NIAID has entrusted the supervision of the vaccination program - with the support of Bill Gates; GAVI, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization - also a creation of Bill Gates, supported by WHO, also heavily funded by the Gates Foundation; the World Bank and UNICEF; as well as a myriad of pharmaceutical partners.Bill Gates also strongly suggests that travelers must have a vaccination certificate in their passports before boarding a plane or entering a country.The implementation of the program, including a related global electronic identity program, possibly administered using nanos chips that could be integrated into the vaccine itself, would be overseen by the little-known agency Agenda ID2020, which is also an initiative from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.Bill Gates is also known as a fervent proponent of a drastic and selective reduction of the population. Knowing what we know, who would trust any vaccine with the signature of Bill Gates. The hope that this evil enterprise will not succeed is very important. Economic war against China. The US strategy is to use COVID-19 to isolate China, despite the fact that the US economy relies heavily on Chinese imports.The short-term disorganization of the Chinese economy is largely due to the (temporary) closure of trade and transportation circuits.The public health emergency declared by the WHO is combined with media misinformation and a ban on flights to China. Panic on Wall Street. Media disinformation has taken on another dimension by causing panic on the stock markets. Fear of the coronavirus has led to a fall in financial markets around the world. According to reports, the value of the world's stock markets has plummeted by around $ 6 trillion. This decline has so far been on the order of \"15% or more\".This causes massive losses in personal savings (ie, average Americans), to which are added personal bankruptcies and corporate bankruptcies.It is also a boon for institutional speculators, especially for corporate hedge funds. The financial meltdown leads to large transfers of monetary wealth in the pockets of a handful of financial institutions.The most ironic is that analysts casually link the collapse of the markets to the spread of the virus, when there are only 64 confirmed cases in the USA.\"No wonder the markets are going down ... the virus has grown so much ...\"Could we \"predict\" the financial crash of February? It would be naive to believe that the financial crisis was only due to market forces that responded spontaneously to the spread of COVID-19. The market was already carefully manipulated by powerful players who use speculative instruments in the derivatives markets, including \"short selling\". The unspoken objective is the concentration of wealth. It was quite a financial boon for the \"insiders\" who knew in advance what would lead to WHO's decision to declare a public health emergency of international concern on January 30.Was the COVID-19 (nCoV-2019) pandemic known in advance? What are the likely repercussions?On October 18, 2019, the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Baltimore undertook a carefully crafted simulation exercise of a coronavirus outbreak called nCoV-2019. In the exercise called Event 201 Simulation of a Coronavirus Pandemic , we “simulated” a stock market fall of 15%. It was not \"planned\" according to event organizers and sponsors, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the World Economic Forum.The simulation carried out in October called nCoV-2019 took place barely two months before the appearance of COVID-19. John Hopkins' pandemic simulation simulated a stock market drop of \"  15% or more  \" (video, section 0.0 - 1'2 ″), which largely corresponds to the drop that really took place at the end of February 2020. Many aspects of this \"simulation exercise\" actually correspond to what actually happened when the Director-General of WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020. What needs to be understood is that those who sponsored the John Hopkins Center “simulation exercise” are powerful and knowledgeable in the areas of “global health” (B. and M. Gates Foundation) and \"The world economy\" (GEF).It should also be noted that WHO initially adopted a similar acronym (to denote the coronavirus) to that of the John Hopkins Center Pandemic Simulation Exercise ( nCoV-2019 ) before changing it to COVID-19. Corruption and the role of WHO.What motivated the WHO Director General, Dr.  Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , to declare that the Ncov-2019 is a \"public health emergency of international concern\" on 30 January, when the epidemic was largely confined to mainland China?Everything suggests that the Director General of WHO Tedros served the interests of powerful corporate partners.According to F. William Engdahl , Tedros has long-standing ties to the Clintons and the Clinton Foundation. He is also closely linked to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Along with the World Economic Forum in Davos, the Gates Foundation sponsored the John Hopkins nCoV-2019 “simulation exercise”.As Minister of Health, Tedros also chaired the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, of which the Gates Foundation was the co-founder. The Global Fund has been marred by fraud and corruption scandals. \"During the three-year campaign by Tedros to get his post at WHO, he was accused of hiding three major cholera epidemics while he was Ethiopia's Minister of Health, falsely qualifying the cases \"acute watery diarrhea\" (a symptom of cholera), to minimize the scale of the epidemic, an accusation he denied. (Engdahl, op. Cit.).A massive vaccine development campaign has been ordered by WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Many pharmaceutical companies are already working on it.In this regard, it is important to recall the fraud of the WHO during the mandate of its predecessor, Dr Margaret Chan , who said this about the H1N1 swine flu pandemic in 2009: Vaccine manufacturers can produce 4.9 billion influenza vaccines a year at best. ( Margaret Chan, executive director of the World Health Organization , cited by Reuters on July 21, 2009, underline added).There was no H1N1 pandemic in 2009. It was a fraud to make money, as revealed by the European Parliament. What is the next step in the COVID-19 pandemic? Is it a fake or a true pandemic?The propaganda against China is not over.Nor is the \"fear pandemic\" outside of China, despite the really low number of \"confirmed cases\".The financial crisis continues, supported by media disinformation and financial interference.If normal business relationships (and transportation) between the US and China are not restored, the delivery of \"Made in China\" consumer goods exported to the United States will be jeopardized.This situation could trigger a major crisis in the retail trade in the USA, where “Made in China” goods constitute a significant part of monthly household consumption. From a public health perspective, the prospects for eliminating COVID-19 in China are favorable. Progress has already been reported. In the rest of the world (where there were approximately 3000 confirmed cases on February 28, 2020), the COVID-19 pandemic continues, along with propaganda for a global vaccination program.Without a fear campaign combined with fake news, COVID-19 would not have made headlines.From a medical point of view, is global vaccination indicated?. 43.3% of \"confirmed cases\" in China are now considered \"recovered\" (see graph above). Western reports do not distinguish between \"confirmed cases\" and \"confirmed infected cases\". It is the latter cases that are relevant. The trend is towards a recovery and a decrease in \"confirmed infected cases\".\n",
      "The WHO massive vaccination campaign (mentioned above) was duly confirmed by its Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , on February 28:\n",
      "“… More than 20 vaccines are being developed worldwide and several therapeutic products are undergoing clinical trials, the first results of which are expected in“ a few weeks ”. (emphasis added). It goes without saying that this WHO decision constitutes another financial windfall for the five main vaccine producers: GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, Merck & Co., Sanofi, and Pfizer, which control 85% of the vaccine market. According to CNBC:  (emphasis added). These companies have entered the race to fight the deadly coronavirus and are working on programs to create vaccines or drugs ... Sanofi is teaming up with the US government to develop a vaccine against the new virus , hoping that its work on the the 2003 SARS outbreak will speed up the process. In 2019, Merck earned $ 8.4 billion in revenues from the vaccine market, a growing segment at an annual rate of 9% since 2010, according to Bernstein.GlaxoSmithKline announced this month its partnership with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations [CEPI] for a vaccination program ... CEPI was launched at the 2017 World Economic Forum.Interestingly, CEPI launched in Davos in 2017 is supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Wellcome Trust (a multi-billion dollar British humanitarian foundation) and the World Economic Forum. The governments of Norway and India are members and their role is mainly to finance CEPI.Chronology. October 18, 2019  : The B. and M. Gates Foundation and the World Economic Forum are partners in the pandemic “simulation exercise” at nCoV-2019 conducted by the John Hopkins Center for Health Security in October 2019.December 31, 2019  : China alerts the WHO to the discovery of several cases of \"unusual pneumonia\" in Wuhan, Hubei province.January 7, 2020  : Chinese officials say they have identified a new virus. WHO names the new virus 2019-nCoV ( exactly the same name as the virus which was the object of the simulation exercise of the John Hopkins Center, except the placement of the date).January 24-25, 2020  : Davos Summit under the auspices of CEPI, which is also the fruit of a partnership between the World Economic Forum and the Gates Foundation, during which the development of a vaccine against the 2019 nCoV is announced (2 weeks after the announcement of January 7, 2020 and barely a week before the declaration of a public health emergency of international scope by the WHO). January 30, 2020  : The WHO director declares a \"public health emergency of international concern\". Now a vaccination campaign has been launched to stop COVID-19 under the auspices of CEPI in partnership with GlaxoSmithKline. Conclusion. COVID-19 (aka nCoV-2019) represents a treasure worth billions of dollars for large pharmaceutical companies. But it also contributes to precipitating humanity into a dangerous process of economic, social and geopolitical destabilization.COVID-19 Coronavirus: A False Pandemic? Who is behind this?

      "The breakdown of the global liberal world order and its foundations. What is happening now is a global breakdown of the world order. It does not matter at all whether the nature of the coronavirus is artificial or not, nor is it even of principal importance whether, if it is artificial, it was deliberately released by the “world government” or not. The epidemic has begun - it is a fact. Now the main thing is to trace how the \"world government\" has reacted to it.To clarify, the \"world government\" is the totality of global political and economic elites and the intellectuals and media (mediacrats) that serve them. Such a \"world government\" necessarily exists, because on a global scale there are strictly-defined, fundamental norms that determine the basic parameters of politics, economics and ideology.In the economy, the only recognized norm is capitalism, the market economy (which is disputed only by North Korea - not, and this is very important, by China, which presents its own version of national state capitalism under the management of the Communist Party).In politics the only recognized norm is parliamentary liberal democracy, based on civil society being the subject and source of legality and legitimacy (besides North Korea, almost everyone is in agreement with this, although China interprets \"civil society\" in a special socialist and partly national-cultural optic and carries out mediacratic screening by means other than direct parliamentary elections; and some Islamic states - for example, Iran and the Gulf monarchies - have a number of special features. In ideology, everyone agrees with the arrangement that any individual has a number of inalienable rights (to life, freedom of conscience, freedom of movement, etc.) which all states and societies are obliged to guarantee.In essence, these are the three basic principles of the global world that emerged after the collapse. of the USSR and the victory of the capitalist West in the Cold War. The main players in politics, economics and ideology are concentrated in Western countries, which set the model for others. This is the core of the \"world government\". Inside this government, China is beginning to play an increasingly important role, towards which the elite of Russia and all other states are rushing.\n",
      "Whether the coronavirus is artificial is not so important. It does not matter whether the coronavirus was produced artificially and deliberately used by the \"world government\" in this sense.But it is this world, under the umbrella of such a \"world government” with all three of its axiomatic foundations, that is collapsing before our very eyes. This is reminiscent of the end of the socialist camp, the bipolar world and the USSR, but then one of two worlds disappeared, while one remained and extended its rules to all others including its yesterday's opponents. Gorbachev himself wanted to get into the \"world government\" without dissolving the USSR, but he was not accepted. Nor were the pro-Western leaders of the Russian Federation who surrendered to the West accepted. They still are not. And now, today, this very \"world government\" is collapsing. Could it have voluntarily opted for liquidation? Hardly. But it reacted to the coronavirus as if to something inevitable, and this was a choice.There was freedom on whether or not to recognize the coronavirus as existing. And by the very fact of its recognition of the pandemic, the \"world government\" signed its own death sentence. Did it do so consciously? No more (or no less) consciously than Gorbachev in Perestroika. In the case of the USSR, one pole disappeared, while the other remained. Today the end of planetary liberal democracy means the end of everything. This system has no other paradigm - except for North Korea (which is still a pure anachronism, albeit a very interesting one) or China’s compromised version.Who should have defeated the coronavirus and how?The coronavirus has already struck a blow from which neither politics, economics, nor ideology will recover. The pandemic would have to have been dealt with by the existing institutions, in normal mode without changing the basic rules neither in politics (meaning no quarantine, no forced isolation, let alone a state of emergency);nor in the economy (no remote work, no stopping of production, exchanges and financial- industrial institutions or trading platforms, no vacation, etc.);nor in ideology (no restrictions, albeit temporary on essential civil rights, freedom of movement, the cancellation or postponement of elections, referenda, etc.).but all of this has already happened on a global scale, including in Western countries, i.e., in the territory of the \"world government\" itself. The very foundations of the global system have been suspended.This is how we see the ongoing situation. For the \"world government\" to take such a step, it had to be forced to do so. By whom? After all, there simply cannot be any higher instance of authority than modern materialistic, atheistic and rationalistic humanity.\n",
      "Liberalism as the final result of New Time. Let us postpone this question for later and now look at the larger historical trajectory of the modern liberal-democratic global system, that is, the government of the \"liberal political elites\" (parliamentarism), major economic players (oligarchs and transnational monopolies), the ideologists of the \"open society\" and the journalists who serve them (including moderators of sentiments on social networks and the Internet). The source of this system should be sought in the end of the Renaissance and in the “New Time” (early Modernity) that emerged therefrom, which saw a fundamental break with the Middle Ages with regard to the subject of power and, consequently, to its very nature. In the Middle Ages and in the society of Tradition overall, the legitimacy and legality of the political model of society were based on the transcendent - superhuman, divine - factor. The supreme subject of power and law was God, His revelations and the laws and settings established by Him, as well as those institutions which were considered to be his representatives on Earth: in the Christian world, these were the Church and the monarchical state. The New Time of Modernity abolished this vertical and set itself the goal of building a society on earthly foundations. Thus the main subject and source of legitimacy and legality became man, and the \"celestial government\" - the \"supra-world government\" - gave way to the \"earthly government\". Politics, economy and ideology changed accordingly: democracy,capitalism and civil society emerged.For several centuries, these principles fought against the old (medieval) order until the last empires - the Russian, Ottoman, Austrian and German - fell in the 20th century. However, liberal democracy still had to cope with such heretical (from the liberal point of view) versions of Modernity as communism and fascism, which in their own ways interpreted \"civil society” and the human being as such: the former in class optics and the latter in national or racial terms. In 1945, the Communists and Liberals jointly ended fascism, and in 1991 the Communists fell. The liberals were the only ones left, and henceforth the \"world government\" turned from a plan into nearly a reality, as all countries and societies have recognized the standards of democracy, the market, and human rights. This is what Francis Fukuyama meant in his book The End of History and the Last Man. The history of this New Time began when the goal was set to replace the celestial subject with the earthly one, and it ended when this replacement was accomplished on a global scale.The end of the liberal world and its parallels with the end of the USSR. Today, instead of the end of history, that is, instead of the total triumph of liberal democracy, world capitalism and the ideology of the \"open society\" (rights of the human as an individual), we have collapsed into completely new conditions overnight. This is as unexpected as the end of the USSR. Even after 1991, many people could not believe that the Soviet system had disappeared, and some cannot even realize it now. Of course, the end of globalism was sensed by some critical thinkers: it was spoken of by conservatives, and the sharp rise of China, which represents a special model of globalism, Putin's refusal to cede power to the manipulable and controllable (as the West thought) Medvedev in 2012, and perhaps most importantly, Brexit and the rise of populism, could all be considered clear signs that, despite its proximity to the final point, globalism has not only been unable to effectively achieve the “end of history”, but is beginning to paradoxically move away from it. On a philosophical level, the postmodernists began to reflect on this, loudly proclaiming that something was wrong with Modernity.But history has no other way left: it must either move forward along the inertia which it has over the past few centuries, since New Time and the Enlightenment, or collapse. Everyone believed that somehow everything would resolve itself, and that the only thing that mattered was to effectively confront those who were categorized as the \"enemies of open society”, i.e., Putin, Iran, Islamic fundamentalism, or the new rise of nationalist movements rapidly responding to the crisis of mass migration. In general, no one thought of an alternative, even consciously ruling out such. And that is why, in the moment of serious crisis, the global liberal system has failed and collapsed. Almost no-one has understood this yet, but it has already happened. And it has happened irrevocably. Coronavirus, by its very fact and especially by the way in which it has been responded to by the \"world government\", has become the end of the modern world.The end of \"the Ego and Its Own\"Does this mean that humanity will die? This is still unknown, but it cannot be ruled out. One can only guess whether it will perish or not. But what can already be said with certainty is that the global world order based on capitalism, liberal democracy and the principles of the sovereign individual (civil society, the open society) has already perished. It is gone, it has collapsed, although desperate efforts will still be undertaken to save it for some time to come. How they will be deployed and how long they will last is not crucial now. It cannot be ruled out that it will disappear altogether like smoke, just like the Soviet system dissolved in thin air.That which just a second ago was, was fleeting, as if it never was. It is much more important to look at what is coming to replace the old world order.\n",
      "The most important thing to understand is that it is not merely a technical failure in the system of global governance that has happened, but rather the resulting, final element of the entire historical process of Modernity, of New Time, over the course of which power was transferred from the celestial subject to the earthly one, and this subject itself - through the ideological and political battles of the last centuries, including the world hot and cold wars - moved towards a certain crystallization, that of parliamentary democracy, the global capitalist market and the individual endowed with rights. The whole system of modern global capitalism is built on the premise of \"the Ego and its Own\" (Max Stirner). The political rights of the \"Ego\" (the individual in complete isolation from nation, race, religion, sex, etc.) were fixed and entrenched in the global systems of political democracy. Economic rights were embodied in the norms of private property and market mechanisms. Thus, the source of political power reached its imminent limit: in liberalism and globalism, the last hints of verticality and “transcendence\" which had been preserved still at the first stages of Modernity, in particular the structures of the state, were eliminated. Hence the globalist aspiration to abolish the sovereignty of the state and transfer its powers to the supranational level, thus legalizing the \"world government\", which de facto already exists. In other words, the political, economic, and ideological history of New Time moved towards a quite definite end, in which the purely human, immanent, individual subject would be finally formed and laid as the basis for political legitimization. Little was left to chance: the complete abolition of states which took place on the level of the European Union was to be repeated on a global scale.The cancelled finale of liberalism. This final moment, to which everything was headed, today is not merely postponed indefinitely, but is altogether cancelled. If political history could not reach this point without the coronavirus, then the whole process collapsed in the face of this epidemic. In order to effectively counteract the epidemic, the authorities of nearly all countries, including those of the West, have introduced compulsory quarantine with strict measures for its violation, or have outright declared emergency situations. The economic mechanisms of the global market have collapsed due to closure of borders, as have stock exchanges and financial institutions. The open society and unhindered migration have come into direct contradiction with basic sanitary standards. In fact, a dictatorial regime has rapidly been established all over the world, under which power has been transferred to a completely new entity. Neither \"the Ego\", nor \"its Own\", nor all of the world's giant superstructures that guaranteed their legal and legitimate rights and statuses are any longer considered the source of political power. What Giorgio Agamben has called the \"naked life\", i.e., the absolutely special, physical survival imperative that has nothing to do with the logic of liberal capitalism, has come to the foreground. Neither equality, rights, law, private property, collective decision-making, the system of mutual obligations, nor any other fundamental principle of liberal democracy has real power. Only those mechanisms that contribute to survival, to stopping infection and providing for the simplest, purely physiological, needs, are important now.But this means that the subject of power is radically changing. It is no longer the free society, nor the market, nor the humanist presumptions of the sovereign individual, nor guarantees of personal freedom and private life. All of this is to be sacrificed if the matter at hand is physical survival. Political rights are abolished, economic obligations are abolished, total surveillance and strict disciplinary control become the only overriding social norm.If the \"world government\" has gone into a state of emergency, proved unable to or did not even dare to bypass it, or was simply forced to accept it, then this means that the paradigm which just yesterday seemed to be unshakeable has been abandoned. And in this case, there is either no \"world government\" at all, and every society saves itself as it can, or the fundamental paradigm abruptly changes and turns into something else. Both in the first and in the second cases, the former order has collapsed, and something new is being built before our very eyes.Such radical conclusions are not just related to the scale of the pandemic, which is not even so great yet. Much more important is the perception of the epidemic by the power elites, who have so quickly and easily abandoned their seemingly inviolable foundations. That is the most fundamental thing. The measures aimed at combating the coronavirus have already undermined the foundations of liberal democracy and capitalism, rapidly abolishing the subject of power itself. From now on, the \"ego and its own\" is no longer the basis of legality and legitimacy: under the conditions of the State of Emergency, power is being transferred to another authority. Something new is becoming the bearer of sovereignty.So what is it?The coronavirus as the ruling subject: the secular gods of the plague. On the one hand, it could be said that the coronavirus itself (the virus has its \"royal\" name for a reason) is demonstrating a status unique to that of the subject. To better understand this, we can recall the ancient plague gods, who were considered formidable deities in the religious beliefs of the peoples of the Middle East. The peoples of Mesopotamia had Erra, Nergal, and others, and in the monotheistic traditions, in particular in Judaism, plagues were sent by the supreme deity, Yahweh, to punish the Jews for idolatry. In the Middle Ages, epidemics and plagues were considered signs of divine punishment. Traditional society can justifiably give the status of subjectivity to large-scale phenomena or link them to the divine element. However, in the New Time of Modernity, man held himself to be the complete master of life, hence the development of modern medicine, drugs, vaccines, etc. Therefore, it is as if the complete inability of governments to counteract the coronavirus today is casting mankind beyond the edge of New Time. But the God or gods to whom the modern virus plague could be ascribed and left to no longer exist. The modern world is convinced that the virus must have earthly, material and immanent origin. But what kind of materiality is stronger than man? Hereby arise the many conspiracy theories linking the origin of the virus to malefactors aspiring to establish their control over mankind. For the philosophers of \"speculative realism,\" who for decades have been thinking about the need to replace humanity with a system of objects - whether Artificial Intelligence or cyborgs - the virus itself might very well be granted the status of sovereign actor, a kind of hyperobject (a la Morton) capable of subjugating the masses of beings to its will, as does mold, the rhizome, and so on. In other words, the collapse of the liberal model brings to the forefront the hypothesis of the post-human, post-humanist actor.Coronavirus, whose Latin name literally means “the crowned poison”, is thus (at least theoretically) a contender for the center of the new world system. If the main concern of mankind from now on will be to counteract the virus, fight against it, protect against it, etc., then the whole system of values, rules and guarantees will be rebuilt according to absolutely new principles and priorities. Speculative realists go even further and are ready to recognize in the hyperobject the presence of infernal entities of the ancient gods of chaos emerging out of the bottom of existence, but it is not necessary to go that far, insofar as, if we simply assume that\n",
      "political, economic and ideological rationality will henceforth be built around the counteraction of contagious viruses, we will live in a different - for example, in a hygienocentric - world, organized in a completely different way than the modern world. The \"Ego\", \"its Own\" and all the structures which guarantee them predictability, stability and protection, which elevate them to the status of the foundations of legality and legitimacy, will fall into the background, while the coronavirus or its analogue will establish a different hierarchy, a different political and economic ontology, a different ideology.The state vs. coronavirus. But which state?If we look at how the fight against coronavirus is unfolding today, we can notice an abruptly sharp increase in the role of the state, which over the course of globalization was considerably relegated to the back-burner. It is at the level of the state that decisions on quarantine, self- isolation, travel bans, restrictions on freedoms and economic measures, are being made. In fact, everywhere in the world - whether openly or by default - a state of emergency has been declared. According to the classics of political thought, and in particular Carl Schmitt, this means the establishment of a regime of dictatorship. The sovereign, according to Schmitt, is he who makes the decision in an emergency situation (Ernstfall), and today this is the state. However, it should not be forgotten that today’s state has until the altogether recent last moment been based on the principles of liberal democracy, capitalism, and the ideology of human rights. In other words, this state is, in some sense, deciding on the liquidation of its own philosophical and ideological basis (even if such are for now formalized, temporary measures, the Roman Empire still began with the temporary dictatorship of Caesar, which gradually became permanent). Thus, the state is rapidly mutating, just as the virus itself is mutating, and the state is following the coronavirus in this constantly evolving struggle, which is taking the situation ever further from the point of global liberal democracy. All the extant borders which until yesterday seemed to be erased or half-erased are once again gaining fundamental meaning - not only for those who are going to cross them, but also for those who simply have managed in time to return to their country. At the same time, in larger countries this fragmentation is being carried over to individual regions, where states of emergency are leading to the establishment of their own, regional dictatorships, which in turn will be strengthened as communication with the center becomes more difficult. Such fragmentation will continue all the way down to small towns and even individual households, where forced closure will open up new horizons and volumes of domestic violence.The state is taking upon itself the mission of fighting the coronavirus under certain conditions, but is waging this fight in already different circumstances. Over the course of this mission, all state institutions related to law, legality and economy are being transformed. Thus, the very introduction of quarantine completely overturns the logic of the market, according to which only the balance of supply and demand and the agreements concluded between employer and employee can regulate the relations between them. Bans on working for hygienic reasons are irrevocably collapsing the entire construction of capitalism. The suspension of freedom of movement, assembly and democratic procedures is blocking the institutions of political democracy and paralyzing individual freedoms.Post-liberal dictatorship. Over the course of this epidemic, a new state is emerging which is beginning to function with new rules. It is very likely that in the process of the state of emergency there will be a shift of power from formal rulers to technical and technological functionaries, e.g., the military, epidemiologists, and institutions especially created for such extreme circumstances. The physical threat which the virus poses to leaders is forcing them to be placed in special conditions that are not always compatible with full control over situations. As legal norms are suspended, new algorithms of behavior and new practices are beginning to be deployed. Thus is born the dictatorial state, which, unlike the liberal-democratic state, has completely different goals, foundations, principles and axioms. In this case, the \"world government\" is dissolved, because any supranational strategy loses all meaning. Power is rapidly moving to an ever lower level - but not to society and not to citizens, but to the military-technological and medical-sanitary level. A radically new rationality is gaining force - not the rationale of democracy, freedom, the market and individualism, but that of pure survival, for which responsibility is assumed by a subject combining direct power and the possession of technical, technological, and medical logistics. Moreover, in the network society, such is based on a system of total surveillance excluding any kind of privacy.Thus, if at one end we have the virus as the subject of transformation, then at the other end we have military-medical surveillance and punitive dictatorship fundamentally differing in all parameters from the state that we knew until yesterday. It is not at all guaranteed that such a state, in its fight against the secular \"plague gods”, will precisely coincide with the borders of existing national entities. Since there will be no ideology or politics beyond the straightforward logic of survival, centralization itself will lose its meaning and its legitimacy.From civil society to \"naked life”. Here once again let us recall the \"naked life\" of Giorgio Agamben, who in a similar vein and based on Schmitt's ideas on the \"state of emergency\" analyzed the situation in Nazi concentration camps, where the dehumanization of people attained the extreme, under which the \"naked life\" revealed itself. The “naked life” is not human life, but some other life that is beyond the limits of self-consciousness, personality, individuality, rights, and so on. Hence why Agamben has been more radical than others and opposed the measures taken against the coronavirus, preferring even death to the introduction of a state of emergency. He clearly saw that even a small step in this direction will change the entire structure of the world order. Entering the stage of dictatorship is easy, but exiting it is sometimes impossible.The \"naked life” is the victim of the virus. It is not people, families, citizens, or private owners. Here there is neither one nor many. There is only the fact of infection, which can turn anyone - including oneself - into an other, and therefore into the enemy of \"naked life.” And it is fighting this other, \"naked life\" that grants dictatorship the new status of the subject. Then, society itself, at the mercy of dictatorship, will be turned into “naked life” organized by the dictatorship in accordance with its own peculiar rationality. Out of fear of the coronavirus, people are ready to go for any of the steps of those who have taken upon themselves responsibility for the state of emergency.Thus, the fundamental split between the healthy and the sick, considered by Michel Foucault in his book \"Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison”, becomes even more impassable of a line than all the oppositions of the classical ideologies of Modernity, e.g., between the bourgeoisie and proletariat, the Aryans and Jews, the liberals and “enemies of the open society”, etc., and will see its dividing line set between the poles of the “naked life” and “medical technologists”, who have in their hands all the instruments of violence, surveillance, and authority. The difference between the already sick and the not yet sick which at first justified the new dictatorship will be erased, and the dictatorship of virologists, which has built new legitimacy on the basis of this distinction, will create a completely new model.\n",
      "The new dictatorship is neither fascism nor communism. This situation will seem to many to be reminiscent of fascism or communism, but these parallels are imaginary. Both fascism and communism represented types of “civil society”, albeit totalitarian ones, with pronounced ideologies which guaranteed civil rights - not to all, but to the significant and, de facto, overwhelming majority of their citizens. Liberalism, by reducing all identities down to the level of the individual, paved the way and created the preconditions for a special type of post-liberal dictatorship that, unlike communism and fascism, should have no ideology at all, insofar as it will have no reason to persuade, mobilize, or \"seduce\" the element of the “naked life\". The \"naked life” is already consciously ready to surrender to dictatorship, regardless of what it promises or insists on. The structures of such a dictatorship will be built on the basis of the fact that it opposes the virus, not on the basis of ideas and preferences. The military-medical hygienic dictatorship will be characterized by a post-liberal logic, for which the only operation will be rational treatment of the \"naked life\", the bearers of which have no rights at all and no identity. This order will be built along the infected vs. healthy watershed, and this dual code will be as powerful as it is obvious, with no need for any justification or argumentation.Artificial Intelligence and its enemies. Here the following consideration comes to mind: in the carriers of such a post-liberal anti-virus dictatorship, we see virtually no properly human traits. Any humanity would only hinder the most effective operation on the \"naked life\", and would thus represent a restless, trembling,survival-at-all-costs-seeking chaos. Consequently, Artificial Intelligence, abstract mechanical calculation, would cope best with this task. In military-medical dictatorship we see a distinct cybernetic dimension, something machine-like and mechanical. If the \"naked life\" is chaos, then there must be a cold mathematical order at the other pole. And from now on, its only legitimization will be not the consent of society, which loses everything but its survival instinct, but the very criterion of its ability to make balanced logical decisions without being affected by superfluous emotions and passions. Therefore, even if a military-medical hygienic dictatorship is established by people, sooner or later its main bearers will be machines.There will be no return Several conclusions can be drawn from this very preliminary analysis of the near future - the future that has already begun:It is impossible to go back to the world order that existed only recently and which seemed so familiar and natural that no one thought about its ephemerality. Liberalism either did not reach its natural end and the establishment of a \"world government\", or nihilistic collapse was its original goal, merely covered by increasingly less convincing and increasingly perverse \"humanist\" decor. Proponents of philosophical \"accelerationism\" speak of \"Black Enlightenment,\" emphasizing this dark, nihilistic aspect of liberalism as representing merely the accelerated movement of man toward the abyss of post-humanism. But in any case, instead of \"world government\" and total democracy, we are entering an era of new fragmentation, of \"closed societies\" and radical dictatorship, perhaps exceeding Nazi concentration camps and the Soviet gulag.The end of globalization will not mean, however, a simple transition to the Westphalian system, to realism and a system of closed trade states (Fichte). Such would require the well- defined ideology that existed in early Modernity, but which was completely eradicated in late Modernity, and especially in Postmodernity. The demonization of anything remotely resembling “nationalism” or “fascism” has led to the total rejection of national identities, and now the severity of the biological threat and its crude physiological nature makes national myths superfluous. The military-medical dictatorship does not need additional methods to motivate the masses, and moreover, nationalism only enhances the dignity, self-consciousness and civil feeling of society which contradict the rules of the \"naked life\". For the society to come, there are only two criteria - healthy and sick. All other forms of identity, including national ones, have no meaning. Approximately the same was true for communism, which was also a motivating ideology that mobilized the consciousness of citizens to build a better society. All these ideologies are archaic, meaningless, redundant and counterproductive in the fight against coronavirus. Therefore, it would be wrong to see any \"new fascism\" or \"new communism\" in the impending post-liberal paradigm. It will be something else. It cannot be ruled out that this new stage will affect so greatly the life of humankind or what will remain of it that, having passed through all these trials and tribulations, mankind will be ready to accept any form of power, any ideology, and any order that will weaken the terror of the Artificial Intelligence-military-medical dictatorship. And then, in a cycle, we cannot rule out a return to the project of \"world government\", but this will already be on a completely different basis, because society will be irreversibly changed over the period of “quarantine\". It will no longer be the choice of \"civil society\", but the cry of \"naked life”, which will recognize any authority that can offer deliverance from the horror that has occurred. This would be the right time for what Christians call the \"Antichrist\" to appear.Exaggeration and the liquidation of leaders Is such an analytical forecast too much of a dramatized exaggeration? I think it is quite realistic, although, of course, \"nobody knows the time\", and in any situation everything might be postponed for some time. The epidemic could end abruptly and a vaccine will be found. But all that has alPANDEMIC AND THE POLITICS OF SURVIVAL: THE HORIZONS OF A NEW TYPE OF DICTATORSHIP\n",

      "The global coronavirus pandemic has huge geopolitical implications. The world will never be the same again. However, it is premature to talk about what kind of world it will end up being. The epidemic has not passed: we have not even reached the peak. The main unknowns remain the following:how many losses will humanity suffer in the end - how many deaths?who will be able to stop the spread of the virus and how?what will be the real consequences for those who fell ill and for those who survived?No one can yet answer these questions, even roughly, and therefore we cannot even remotely imagine what the real damage will be. In the worst case, the pandemic will lead to a serious drop in the world population. At best, panic will prove premature and unfounded. But even after the first months of the pandemic, some global geopolitical changes are already quite evident and largely irreversible. No matter how the events that follow will develop, something in the world order has changed once and for all.The outbreak of the coronavirus epidemic represents a decisive moment in the destruction of the unipolar world and the collapse of globalization. The crisis of unipolarity and the breakdown of globalization have been evident since the beginning of the 2000s - the catastrophe of September 11, the strong growth of the Chinese economy, the return to Putin's Russia's global politics as an increasingly sovereign entity , the strong mobilization of the Islamic factor, the growing migration crisis and the rise of populism in Europe and even in the United States, which led to the election of Trump and many other parallel phenomena, made it clear that the world formed in the nineties around the predominance of the West, the United States and global capitalism has entered a phase of crisis. The multipolar world order begins to form with new central actors, civilizations, as anticipated by Samuel Huntington [Cfr. Aleksandr Dugin, Multipolar World Theory , AGA Editrice, 2019, NdT]. But in the face of the signs of an emerging multipolarity, one thing is a trend, another is objective reality. It is like ice cracked in the spring - it is clear that it will not last long, but at the same time, it is undeniable that you can also move on it, even if you run some risk. Nobody can be sure when the cracked ice will actually give up.Now we can start a countdown to a multipolar world order and the starting point is the coronavirus epidemic. The pandemic has buried globalization, open society and the global capitalist system. The virus forced us on ice and the individual enclaves of humanity began to take their own isolated historical trajectories.Coronavirus has buried all the major myths of globalization:the effectiveness of open borders and the interdependence of countries in the world,the ability of supranational institutions to cope with an extraordinary situation,the sustainability of the global financial system and the global economy as a whole, facing serious challenges, the futility of centralized states, socialist regimes and disciplinary methods in solving acute problems and the total superiority of liberal strategies towards them,\n",
      "- the total triumph of liberalism as a panacea for all problematic situations.Their solutions have not worked in Italy, nor in other European Union countries, nor in the United States. The only thing that proved effective was the clear closure of society, dependence on internal resources, the strong power of the state and the isolation of the sick from the healthy, citizens from foreigners, etc.At the same time, Western countries also reacted to the pandemic in a very different way: the Italians introduced the total quarantine, Macron introduced a state dictatorship regime (in the Jacobin spirit), Merkel has allocated 500 billion euros to support the population, and Boris Johnson, following the spirit of Anglo-Saxon individualism, suggested that the disease should be considered a private matter affecting every English taken individually and refused to perform the swab tests, sympathizing in advance with those who lose loved ones. Trump established a state of emergency in the United States, closing connections with Europe and the rest of the world. If the West acts in such a disparate and contradictory way, what will become of the rest of the countries? Everyone seems to be saved as they can. This goal was best achieved by China, which, thanks to the practical policies of the Communist Party, established strict disciplinary methods to combat contagion, accusing the United States of spreading it. The same accusation was made by Iran, which was hit hard by the virus - even among the leaders of the country.Thus, the virus tore open society to pieces and pushed humanity forward on its path to a multipolar world.Regardless of how the fight against coronavirus will end, it is clear that globalization has collapsed. This could almost certainly mark the end of liberalism and its total ideological domination. It is difficult to predict the final version of the future world order - especially in its details. Multipolarism is a system that historically has never existed, and if we look for some remote analogy, we should not turn to the era of the more or less equivalent European states according to the Westphalian world, but to the period before the era of the Great Geographical Discoveries, when, together with Europe (divided into western and eastern Christian countries), the Islamic world, India, China and Russia existed as independent civilizations. The same civilizations existed in the pre-colonial period in America (the Incas, the Aztecs, etc. ) and in Africa. There were links and contacts between these civilizations, but there was no single type of link with universal values, institutions and systems.The post coronavirus world is likely to include individual regions of the world, civilizations, continents that are gradually transforming themselves into independent actors. At the same time, the universal model of liberal capitalism is likely to collapse. This model currently serves as the common denominator of the whole structure of unipolarity: from the absolutization of the market to parliamentary democracy and the ideology of human rights, including the notion of progress and the law of technological development which have risen to the rank of dogma in the 'Europe  New Age  (of the New Times) and have spread to all human societies through colonization (directly or indirectly in the form of westernization).Much will depend on who defeats the epidemic and how: where disciplinary measures prove effective, they will enter the future political and economic order as an essential component. The same conclusion can be reached by those who, on the other hand, will not be able to face the threat of a pandemic through the opening and absence of severe measures. Temporary alienation dictated by the direct threat of contagion from another country and from another region, the breakdown of economic ties and the necessary alienation from a single financial system will force the states affected by the epidemic to seek self-sufficiency, because the priority will be food security, minimum autonomy and economic autarchy to meet the vital needs of the population, beyond any economic dogma considered mandatory before the coronavirus crisis. Even where liberalism and capitalism are preserved, they will be placed in a national framework in the spirit of mercantilist theories that insist on maintaining the monopoly of foreign trade in the hands of the state. Those who are less tied to the liberal tradition can very well move in the areas of the most optimal organization of the \"great space\" in other directions - taking into account the civilizational and cultural specificities.\n",
      "It cannot be said in advance what the multipolar model as a whole will eventually become, but the very fact of breaking the universally binding dogma of liberal globalization will open up completely new opportunities and paths for each civilization.After the coronavirus: multipolar security. The multipolar world will create a completely new security architecture. It may not be more sustainable or adaptable to conflict resolution, but it will be different. In this new model, the West, the United States and NATO, if NATO still exists, will be only one factor among others. The United States itself will clearly not be able (and probably will not, if Trump's line eventually prevails in Washington) to play the role of sole global arbiter, and therefore the United States will acquire a different status after the quarantine and emergency state. It can be compared to Israel's role in the Middle East. Israel is undoubtedly a powerful country, which actively influences the balance of power in the region, but does not export its ideology and values ​​to the surrounding Arab countries. On the contrary, it retains its Jewish identity for itself, rather trying to free itself from readers of other values ​​rather than include them in its composition. The construction of a wall with Mexico and Trump's invitation to the Americans to focus on their internal problems is similar to Israel's path: the United States will be a powerful power, but its liberal-capitalist ideology will have value are for themselves , without attracting third parties. The same will apply to Europe. As a result, the most important factor in the unipolar world will radically change its status. The construction of a wall with Mexico and Trump's invitation to the Americans to focus on their internal problems is similar to Israel's path: the United States will be a powerful power, but its liberal-capitalist ideology will have value are for themselves , without attracting third parties.

The same will apply to Europe. As a result, the most important factor in the unipolar world will radically change its status.This, of course, will lead to a redistribution of forces and functions among other civilizations. Europe, if it maintains its unity in some way, is likely to create its own military blockade independent of the United States, which has already been mentioned after the collapse of the Soviet Union (the Eurocorps project  ) and to which Macron and Merkel have repeatedly mentioned. While not directly hostile to the United States, such a blockade will in many cases pursue purely European interests, which at times may differ significantly from those of the United States. This will primarily affect relations with Russia, Iran, China and the Islamic world.China will have to transform itself from the beneficiary of globalization and adapt to pursue its national interests as a regional power. This is exactly what all the processes in China are heading towards lately - the strengthening of Xi Jianping's power, the \"One Belt One Road\" project, etc. It will no longer be a globalization with Chinese characteristics, but a project explicitly focused on the Far East with peculiar Confucian and partly socialist characteristics. Clearly, conflicts in the Pacific Ocean with the United States will worsen at some point.The Islamic world will face a difficult problem linked to the new paradigm of self-organization, since in the conditions of formation of the great spaces - Europe, China, USA, Russia, etc. - the individual Islamic countries will not be fully commensurate with the rest and effectively defend their interests. There will be a need for several Islamic integration poles - Shiites (with the center in Iran) and Sunnis, where, together with Indonesia and Pakistan in the east, a western Sunni bloc will probably be built around Turkey and some Arab countries such as Egypt or the Gulf States.And finally, in the multipolar world order, Russia will have the historical possibility of strengthening itself as an independent civilization that will see its power increase following the strong decline of the West and its internal geopolitical fragmentation. But, at the same time, this will also represent a challenge: before establishing itself fully as one of the most influential and powerful poles of the multipolar world, Russia will have to pass the test of maturity, preserving its unity and reaffirming its areas of influence in the Eurasian space. It is not yet clear where the southern and western borders of Russia-Eurasia will be post coronavirus. This will largely depend on what regime, what methods and efforts Russia will use to deal with the pandemic and what political consequences this will have. Moreover, it is impossible to predict with cognition the state of the other \"great spaces\" - the poles of the multipolar world. The establishment of the Russian perimeter will depend on many factors, some of which may prove to be rather acute and conflicting.Gradually, a multipolar settlement system will be formed - both based on a UN reformed under the conditions of multipolarity, and in the form of some new organization. Again, it will all depend on how the fight against coronavirus will unfold.The virus as a mission. Without pretense: the coronavirus pandemic represents a turning point in world history. Not only are stock indices and oil prices plummeting, the world order itself is also plummeting. We live in the period that marks the end of liberalism and its \"obviousness\" as a global meta-narrative, the end of its dispositions and standards. Human societies will soon become freely floating: no more dogmas, no more imperialism than the dollar, no more spells of the free market, no more dictatorship than the Fed or global stock exchanges, no more enslavement to the world media elite. Each pole will build its future on its civilization foundations. It is obviously impossible to say what this will look like or what it will bring. However,What neither ideologies, nor wars, nor bitter economic conflicts, nor terror, nor religious movements have been able to do, has been accomplished by an invisible but deadly virus. It brought with it death, suffering, horror, panic, pain ... but also the future.THE CORONAVIRUS AND THE HORIZON OF A MULTIPOLAR WORLD: THE GEOPOLITICAL POSSIBILITIES OF THE EPIDEMIC\n",

      "Last year a mysterious shipment was caught smuggling Coronavirus from Canada. It was traced to Chinese agents working at a Canadian lab. Subsequent investigation by GreatGameIndia linked the agents to Chinese Biological Warfare Program from where the virus is suspected to have leaked causing the Wuhan Coronavirus outbreak.Note: The findings of this investigation has been corroborated by none other than the Bioweapons expert Dr. Francis Boyle who drafted the Biological Weapons Convention Act followed by many nations. The report has caused a major international controversy and is suppressed actively by a section of mainstream media.The Saudi SARS Sample. On June 13, 2012 a 60-year-old Saudi man was admitted to a private hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, with a 7-day history of fever, cough, expectoration, and shortness of breath. He had no history of cardiopulmonary or renal disease, was receiving no long-term medications, and did not smoke.Egyptian virologist Dr. Ali Mohamed Zaki isolated and identified a previously unknown coronavirus from his lungs. After routine diagnostics failed to identify the causative agent, Zaki contacted Ron Fouchier, a leading virologist at the Erasmus Medical Center (EMC) in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, for advice. Fouchier sequenced the virus from a sample sent by Zaki. Fouchier used a broad-spectrum “pan-coronavirus” real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method to test for distinguishing features of a number of known coronaviruses known to infect humans.This Coronavirus sample was acquired by Scientific Director Dr. Frank Plummer (key to Coronavirus investigation Frank Plummer was recently assassinated in Africa) of Canada’s National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) in Winnipeg directly from Fouchier, who received it from Zaki. This virus was reportedly stolen from the Canadian lab by Chinese agents.The Canadian Lab\n",
      "Coronavirus arrived at Canada’s NML Winnipeg facility on May 4, 2013 from the Dutch lab. The Canadian lab grew up stocks of the virus and used it to assess diagnostic tests being used in Canada. Winnipeg scientists worked to see which animal species can be infected with the new virus.Research was done in conjunction with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency’s national lab, the National Centre for Foreign Animal Diseases which is housed in the same complex as the National Microbiology Laboratory.NML has a long history of offering comprehensive testing services for coronaviruses. It isolated and provided the first genome sequence of the SARS coronavirus and identified another coronavirus NL63 in 2004.This Winnipeg based Canadian lab was targeted by Chinese agents in what could be termed as Biological Espionage.Chinese Biological Espionage. In March 2019, in mysterious event a shipment of exceptionally virulent viruses from Canada’s NML ended up in China. The event caused a major scandal with Bio-warfare experts questioning why Canada was sending lethal viruses to China. Scientists from NML said the highly lethal viruses were a potential bio-weapon.\n",
      "Following investigation, the incident was traced to Chinese agents working at NML. Four months later in July 2019, a group of Chinese virologists were forcibly dispatched from the Canadian National Microbiology Laboratory (NML). The NML is Canada’s only level-4 facility and one of only a few in North America equipped to handle the world’s deadliest diseases, including Ebola, SARS, Coronavirus, etc.Xiangguo Qiu – The Chinese Bio-Warfare Agent. The NML scientist who was escorted out of the Canadian lab along with her husband, another biologist, and members of her research team is believed to be a Chinese Bio-Warfare agent Xiangguo Qiu. Qiu was the head of the Vaccine Development and Antiviral Therapies Section in the Special Pathogens Program at Canada’s NML.Xiangguo Qiu is an outstanding Chinese scientist born in Tianjin. She primarily received her medical doctor degree from Hebei Medical University in China in 1985 and came to Canada for graduate studies in 1996. Later on, she was affiliated with the Institute of Cell Biology and the Department of Pediatrics and Child Health of the University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, not engaged with studying pathogens. But a shift took place, somehow. Since 2006, she has been studying powerful viruses in Canada’s NML. The viruses shipped from the NML to China were studied by her in 2014, for instance (together with the viruses Machupo, Junin, Rift Valley Fever, Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever and Hendra).Infiltrating the Canadian Lab. Dr. Xiangguo Qiu is married to another Chinese scientist – Dr. Keding Cheng, also affiliated with the NML, specifically the “Science and Technology Core”. Dr. Cheng is primarily a bacteriologist who shifted to virology. The couple is responsible for infiltrating Canada’s NML with many Chinese agents as students from a range of Chinese scientific facilities directly tied to China’s Biological Warfare Program, namely:Institute of Military Veterinary, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Changchun. Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Chengdu Military Region. Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hubei.Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing. All of the above four mentioned Chinese Biological Warfare facilities collaborated with Dr. Xiangguo Qiu within the context of Ebola virus, the Institute of Military Veterinary joined a study on the Rift Valley fever virus too, while the Institute of Microbiology joined a study on Marburg virus. Noticeably, the drug used in the latter study – Favipiravir – has been earlier tested successfully by the Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences, with the designation JK-05 (originally a Japanese patent registered in China already in 2006), against Ebola and additional viruses.However, the studies by Dr. Qiu are considerably more advanced and apparently vital for the Chinese biological weapons development in case Coronavirus, Ebola, Nipah, Marburg or Rift Valley fever viruses are included therein.The Canadian investigation is ongoing and questions remain whether previous shipments to China of other viruses or other essential preparations, took place from 2006 to 2018, one way or another.Dr. Xiangguo Qiu also collaborated in 2018 with three scientists from the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, Maryland, studying post-exposure immunotherapy for two Ebola viruses and Marburg virus in monkeys; a study supported by the US Defense Threat Reduction Agency.The Wuhan Coronavirus. Dr. Xiangguo Qiu made at least five trips over the school year 2017-18 to the above mentioned Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which was certified for BSL4 in January 2017. Moreover, in August 2017, the National Health Commission of China approved research activities involving Ebola, Nipah, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses at the Wuhan facility.Coincidentally, the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory is located only 20 miles away from the Huanan Seafood Market which is the epicenter of the Coronavirus outbreak dubbed the Wuhan Coronavirus.The Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory is housed at the Chinese military facility Wuhan Institute of Virology linked to China’s Biological Warfare Program. It was the first ever lab in the country designed to meet biosafety-level-4 (BSL-4) standards – the highest biohazard level, meaning that it would be qualified to handle the most dangerous pathogens. \n",
      "In January 2018, the lab was operational ‘for global experiments on BSL-4 pathogens,’ wrote Guizhen Wu in the journal Biosafety and Health. ‘After a laboratory leak incident of SARS in 2004, the former Ministry of Health of China initiated the construction of preservation laboratories for high-level pathogens such as SARS, coronavirus, and pandemic influenza virus,’ wrote Guizhen Wu.Coronavirus Bioweapon. The Wuhan institute has studied coronaviruses in the past, including the strain that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, H5N1 influenza virus, Japanese encephalitis, and dengue. Researchers at the institute also studied the germ that causes anthrax – a biological agent once developed in Russia.“Coronaviruses (particularly SARS) have been studied in the institute and are probably held therein,” said Dany Shoham, a former Israeli military intelligence officer who has studied Chinese biowarfare. He said. “SARS is included within the Chinese BW program, at large, and is dealt with in several pertinent facilities.”James Giordano, a neurology professor at Georgetown University and senior fellow in Biowarfare at the U.S. Special Operations Command, said China’s growing investment in bio-science, looser ethics around gene-editing and other cutting-edge technology and integration between government and academia raise the spectre of such pathogens being weaponized.That could mean an offensive agent, or a modified germ let loose by proxies, for which only China has the treatment or vaccine. “This is not warfare, per se,” he said. “But what it’s doing is leveraging the capability to act as global saviour, which then creates various levels of macro and micro economic and bio-power dependencies.”China’s Biological Warfare Program. In a 2015 academic paper, Shoham – of Bar-Ilan’s Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies – asserts that more than 40 Chinese facilities are involved in bio-weapon production.China’s Academy of Military Medical Sciences actually developed an Ebola drug – called JK-05 — but little has been divulged about it or the defence facility’s possession of the virus, prompting speculation its Ebola cells are part of China’s bio-warfare arsenal, Shoham told the National Post.Ebola is classified as a “category A” bioterrorism agent by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, meaning it could be easily transmitted from person to person, would result in high death rates and “might cause panic.” The CDC lists Nipah as a category C substance, a deadly emerging pathogen that could be engineered for mass dissemination.China’s Biological Warfare Program is believed to be in an advanced stage that includes research and development, production and weaponization capabilities. Its current inventory is believed to include the full range of traditional chemical and biological agents with a wide variety of delivery systems including artillery rockets, aerial bombs, sprayers, and short-range ballistic missiles.Weaponizing Biotech.China’s national strategy of military-civil fusion has highlighted biology as a priority, and the People’s Liberation Army could be at the forefront of expanding and exploiting this knowledge.The PLA is pursuing military applications for biology and looking into promising intersections with other disciplines, including brain science, supercomputing, and artificial intelligence. Since 2016, the Central Military Commission has funded projects on military brain science, advanced biomimetic systems, biological and biomimetic materials, human performance enhancement, and “new concept” biotechnology.In 2016, an AMMS doctoral researcher published a dissertation, “Research on the Evaluation of Human Performance Enhancement Technology,” which characterized CRISPR-Cas as one of three primary technologies that might boost troops’ combat effectiveness. The supporting research looked at the effectiveness of the drug Modafinil, which has applications in cognitive enhancement; and at transcranial magnetic stimulation, a type of brain stimulation, while also contending that the “great potential” of CRISPR-Cas. as a “military deterrence technology in which China should “grasp the initiative” in development.In 2016, the potential strategic value of genetic information led the Chinese government to launch the National Genebank, which intends to become the world’s largest repository of such data. It aims to “develop and utilize China’s valuable genetic resources, safeguard national security in bioinformatics, and enhance China’s capability to seize the strategic commanding heights” in the domain of Biotechnology Warfare.Chinese military’s interest in biology as an emerging domain of warfare is guided by strategists who talk about potential “genetic weapons” and the possibility of a “bloodless victory.”This story has been published in full in one of the world’s largest Chinese TV News Network – NTDTV.\n",

      "A few days ago, Dr. Tedros, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) repeated what he said already a few weeks ago, that there are about 20 pharmaceutical laboratories throughout the world that are developing a vaccine for the novel coronavirus, named COVID-19, also called 2019-nCOV, or SARS-CoV-2. For the layman, it is just a stronger mutation of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus, that broke out in 2002 / 2003, also in China. To be sure, a mutation made in a laboratory. In a US high-security biological warfare laboratory. In other words, both SARS and COVID-19 – among many other bio-war agents – were made in the US.And now, the chaotic western-style race of private corporations for a vaccine wanting to outdo one another, has begun.\n",
      "Who is first to develop a vaccine? – It’s a fierce competition to establish a patent, a monopoly – for a possibly multi trillion-dollar business. Its western neoliberal capitalism at its very worst – or best, depending on the angle from where one looks.There are no words to describe this chaotic fever for profit over human wellbeing. It has nothing to do with health, with healing sick and suffering, possibly dying people. It’s all about money. Hundreds of billions, if not trillion of profit for the pharmaceutical oligarch and their associated research laboratories and enterprises. And even more so, if the WHO-declared “pandemic” (sic) will prompt a forced vaccination campaign, enhanced by military and police surveillance.Let’s put COVID-19 in context. As of 23 March 2020 (18:33 GMT), and according to WHO statistics, reported worldwide cases are 372572; deaths 16313; recovered 101373 – a death rate of 4.37%. However, these figures must be considered with caution. In many countries, especially developing economies, accurate testing may be a problem. Test kits are often not available, or not reliable. So, may people who go to the doctor with some flu symptoms are possibly falsely diagnosed as COVID-19 victims, as it serves the publicity hype.Miscalculations and false reporting may even occur in the United States. Mr. Robert Redfield, CEO of the US Center for Disease Control (CDC), testified before Congress that CDC does no longer carry out regular tests, that these were carried out at State-level and only in extreme cases. See also this reference form the LA Times of California measures and directives.By comparison, the US CDC estimates that in the 2019 / 2020 flu season in the US alone, some 38 to 54 million people may catch the common flu, and 23000 to 59000 may die from it. The vast majority of these deaths will be elderly people above 70-years of age and many of them with pre-health conditions and /or pre-existing respiratory problems. This is pretty much the same disease and death pattern as with COVID-19. Expanding these common flu figures linearly on a worldwide scale would result in hundreds of thousands of flu deaths. In the particularly strong 2017-2018 US flu season, an estimated 60000 people died from the flu in the US alone. The reader may himself judge whether WHO was justified declaring COVID-19 a “pandemic” — or whether there may have been – just perhaps – another agenda behind it?The vaccine that might eventually be applied to COVID-19, may most likely no longer be valid for the next coronavirus outbreak – which, also according to Mr. Redfield, CDC, will most probably occur. A later virus may most certainly have mutated. It’s quite similar to the common flu virus. In fact, the annually reoccurring common flu virus contains a proportion of 10% to 15% (some times more) of coronaviruses.\n",
      "The effectiveness of the annual flu vaccines is on average less than 50%, not to mention all the potential harmful side effects, they carry along. COVID-19 is very similar to influenza. Will a corona virus vaccine be equally weak in protecting a potential patient from a future infection?Cooperation instead of competition, doesn’t occur in the west. It’s all profit-driven. With a number of different vaccines from different pharma giants coming on the market, who will tell the patient which one is the best, most suitable for the patient’s condition? It smells like an utter chaotic scam.The real question is – are vaccines – or a vaccine – even necessary? Maybe – maybe not. The production of vaccines is pushed for profit motives and for an important political agenda for a New World Order – that has been planned to change human life as we know it, or thought we knew it. See further explanations below.Vaccines don’t heal, they may prevent the virus from hitting as hard as it might otherwise do, or not at all, depending on the age, physical and health condition of a person. Worldwide statistics show that usually a person up to the age of 40 or 50, who is infected by the COVID-19, has none or only slight symptoms, nothing to worry about.Should symptoms show up, staying home, resting and using traditional, age-old medicine, the same that might be used for the common flu, might be enough to get rid of the virus. This might resolve the disease within one or two weeks. Then, the person will be naturally “vaccinated” against this strand of coronavirus. Elderly people above 65 or 70 may be more at risk and special attention may be in order – separated from crowds, isolation during a two-week quarantine (the incubation period), while the rest of society goes on with life as normal as possible, thereby reducing the huge cost to society.China has brought the COVID-19 pandemic under control without a vaccine, but using common sense and traditional, rather inexpensive medication. What are these regular medicines that are effective and have helped to bring COVID-19 under control in China, without a vaccine?The “Children’s Health Defense” (the Children’s Defense Fund – CDF), an American NGO, founded 1973 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., depicts the current power struggle in France between health official and the country’s leading experts in virology, as representative for the worldwide fight between corporate pharma supported by (bought) governments and international organizations, such as WHO – and renowned scientists. If laid open, it is an eye-opener. See full CDF study.French Professor Didier Raoult, who is one of the world’s top 5 scientists on communicable diseases, argued that the approach of mass quarantine is both inefficient and outdated and that large-scale testing and treatment of suspected cases achieves far better results.Early on, Dr. Raoult suggested the use of hydroxychloroquine (Chloroquine or Plaquenil), a well-known, simple, and inexpensive drug, also used to fight Malaria, and that has shown efficacy with previous coronaviruses such as SARS. By mid-February 2020, clinical trials at his institute and in China already confirmed that the drug could reduce the viral load and bring spectacular improvement. The Chinese scientists published their first trials on more than 100 patients and announced that the Chinese National Health Commission would recommend Chloroquine in their new guidelines to treat Covid-19.In addition, China and Cuba are working together with the use of Interferon Alpha 2B, a highly efficient anti-viral drug developed in Cuba some 39 years, but little known to the world, because of the US imposed embargo on anything from Cuba. Interferon has also proven to be very effective in fighting COVID-19 and is now produced in a joint-venture in China.\n",
      "Chinese researchers in cooperation with Cuban scientists are also developing a vaccine which may soon be ready for testing. In contrast to the west, working exclusively on profit-motives, the Chinese-Cuban vaccine would be made available at low cost to the entire world.Other simple, but effective remedies include the use of heavy doses of Vitamin C, as well as Vitamin D3, or more generally the use of Micronutrients essential to fight infections, include vitamins A, B, C, D, and E.Another remedy that has been used for thousands of years by ancient Chinese, Romans and Egyptians, are Colloidal silver products. They come in forms to be administered as a liquid by mouth, or injected, or applied to the skin. Colloidal silver products are boosting the immune system, fighting bacteria and viruses, and have been used for treating cancer, HIV/AIDS, shingles, herpes, eye ailments, prostatitis – and COVID-19.\n",
      "Yet another simple and inexpensive remedy, to be used in combination with others, is menthol-based “Mentholatum”. It’s used for common flu and cold symptoms. Rubbed on and around the nose, it acts as a disinfectant and prevents germs to enter the respiratory track.Northern Italy and New Orleans report that an unusual number of patients had to be hospitalized in Intensive Care Units (ICU) and be put 24×7 on a 90% strength respirator, with some of them remaining unresponsive, going into respiratory failure. The reported death rate is about 40%. The condition is called acute respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS. That means the lungs are filled with fluid. When this description of ARDS episodes applies, Dr. Raoult and other medical colleagues recommend COVID-19 patients to “sleep sitting up” until they are cured. This helps drain the liquid out of the lungs. The method has been known to work successfully since it was first documented during the 1918 Spanish Flu epidemic.As you may expect, if you look up any of these alternative cures on internet – internet controlled by Google and the Big Corporatocracy, including the pharmaceuticals, will logically advise you against using them. At best they will tell you that these products or methods have not proven effective, and at worst, that they may be harmful. Don’t believe it. None of these products or methods are harmful. Remember, some of them have been used as natural remedies for thousands of years. And remember, China has successfully come to grips with COVID-19, using some of these relatively simple and inexpensive medications.Unfortunately, few doctors are aware of these practical, simple and inexpensive remedies. They are safe and more often than not successful. The media, under pressure from the pharma giants and the compliant government agencies, have been requested to censoring such valuable information. The negligence or failure, to make such easily accessible remedies public knowledge is killing people.Now, let’s cut to the chase, to what’s behind it all – behind the extraordinary monstrous media propaganda hype that is bringing down the entire (western) world’s socioeconomic system, creating untold misery, famine, and death. A misery with suffering potentially by orders of magnitude worse than the Big Depression of 1928 / 1929 and the subsequent years.If anybody had any doubts up to now, where the virus originated, the truth was dropped surreptitiously, a slip of the tongue or on purpose, by Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, when he addressed the Nation on 21 March on COVID-19, he said, “This is not about retribution, we are in a live exercise here…”, meaning military exercise, or a war game.President Trump by Pompeo’s side was whispering, “you should have let us know”. Whatever that means. It’s hard to believe that Mr. Trump didn’t know. But these are the vagaries of American politics, even on a death-serious subject like the new coronavirus breakout. See here with a brief video. See this also.This live (military) exercise has unimaginable worldwide implications which may completely transform our lives. It’s economic warfare. Almost every country on this planet is on some kind of a lock-down, a quarantine of sorts for an as of yet undetermined period, with businesses closed, shops and restaurants shot, construction sites halted, people working from home if they can, being in the streets is forbidden, in many countries under police and military surveillance, with cases of people being beaten up and hand-cuffed, if they have no good explanation.The President Macron-inspired French police is especially known for its uncontrolled brutality fighting the Yellow Vests. They have already demonstrated their same despise for their fellow citizens, when they are in the streets, even food shopping, without a special permit.Borders are shot, airlines are grounded, tourism comes to a screeching halt, basically from one day to the other, stranded throughout the world. With a few exceptions, Germany and France are rare ones, they organize return flights for their citizens abroad. Otherwise, with uncertain flight departures, over-booked and over-crowded flights, the stranded tourists have hardly a chance to return home soon.The socioeconomic cost is astronomical. In the multi-quadrillion, or quintillion; numbers with so many zeros they make you dizzy. This calamity can only partly be valued with numbers, and not now, as the world’s lock-down continues – with a social cost that cannot be valued. The dive of the stock market by about 30% – a typical bonanza for forward speculators and Big Finance, Big Banking, with multi-trillion-dollar losses for the small investors.Millions, if not hundreds of millions of small and medium size businesses going broke, unemployment going rampant, in the hundreds of millions, throughout the world, and the poorest of the poor, especially in developing countries, who are either unemployed or survive on small hourly or day-to-day jobs – they have no income, cannot buy the basics for survival – some of them may die from famine, others may commit suicide, others convert to crime. This is Greece by a factor of thousand, or worse.Then, there is a moral and societal breakdown from a forced quarantine, for which there is no clear end in sight. This creates fear and anxieties, frustration and anger.  For many it’s like solitary confinement – all of which is bad for health, and lowers the immune defense system. Just what those who pull the strings want.So, whom does this live (military) exercise serve? – First one would assume its destined to break China’s back, as China is the up-and-coming economic power. It is true, China’s economy has suffered enormously, with about 60% to 70% of all production stopped for the first two months this year, the time of the COVID-19 outbreak and peak, meaning a significant plunge of China’s GDP, maybe as much as 40% for January and February 2020.However, China has the corona virus now firmly under control. And China being China, her economy is recovering fast and may soon be back to what it was in December 2019. In fact, despite the significant impact of COVID-19, China’s economy may soon overtake that of the self-styled empire, the United States of America. China’s currency the yuan, is solidly backed by a strong economy and by gold, and is slated to become the world’s chief reserve currency, replacing the US-dollar, which had that role for the last 100 years. When that happens, the US hegemony is doomed.It goes without saying, our monetary system is planned to be fully electronic, no more cash – cash is poison – or as WHO’s Director General recently warned, not verbatim, but with that meaning, cash is dangerous for infections, paper money and coins may carry deadly viruses – thereby paving the way for full digitization of our monetary system. This has, indeed, already been tested over the past few years, mainly in Scandinavian countries, where entire department stores refuse to accept cash. In response to the WHO DG’s recommendation, some shops and restaurants in Germany refuse to accept cash.The universal vaccination and electronic ID go together and will first be tested in a few developing countries. Bangladesh is one of them. The vaccination program is the platform for the mega-changes the New World Order (NOW), or the One World Order (OWO) wants to bring about. This, in addition to the enormous money-making bonanza.An almost unknown agency called Agenda ID2020 is behind all this, monitoring, directing and adjusting the implementation of the various programs – that are supposed to eventually lead to Full Spectrum Dominance. For more details, see also the recent article on the dangers of Agenda ID2020.Behind this elaborate and complex network of things, appears time and again, one prominent name: Bill Gates, the Bill and Melinda Gate’s Foundation. Bill Gates has been funding vaccination programs in Africa for decades. And Bill Gates and the Rockefellers make no secret that one of their ultimate goal for planet earth is a drastic population reduction.Abstract of Agenda ID2020.Agenda ID2020 – is an alliance of public-private partners, including UN agencies and civil society. It’s an electronic ID program that uses generalized vaccination as a platform for digital identity. The program harnesses existing birth registration and vaccination operations to provide newborns with a portable and persistent biometrically-linked digital identity.GAVI, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, identifies itself on its website as a global health partnership of public and private sector organizations dedicated to “immunization for all”. GAVI is supported by WHO, and needless to say, its main partners and sponsors are the pharma-industry.The ID2020 Alliance at their 2019 Summit, entitled “Rising to the Good ID Challenge”, in September 2019 in New York, decided to roll out their program in 2020, a decision confirmed by the WEF in January 2020 in Davos. Their digital identity program will be tested with the government of Bangladesh. GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, and “partners from academia and humanitarian relief” (as they call it), are part of the pioneer party.Is it just a coincidence that ID2020 is being rolled out at the onset of what WHO calls a Pandemic? – Or is a pandemic needed to ‘roll out’ the multiple devastating programs of ID2020?How the Vaccination Research and Production is supposed to work.How will this elaborate and complex business of creating vaccines and implementing vaccine campaign work? As most official activities that basically are government responsibilities are privatized and outsourced, they become complex, chaotic at times and inefficient. In the case of the west, the US pretends to take the lead, but will also assign responsibilities to European pharma-labs.The National Institute of Health (NIH) has overall responsibility for national health research and program implementation. NIH’s Director is Anthony Fauci. The Institute was created in 1955. Under NIH, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), one of 27 institutes, reporting to NIH, is responsible for vaccination programs. NIAD’s mission is to conduct basic and applied research to better understand, treat and prevent infectious, immunologic and allergic diseases. NIAD has outsourced the vaccination program to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).CEPI was formed by the WEF (World Economic Forum) in Davos in January 2017. It was founded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) and the London-based Welcome Trust, created in 1936, but including now as members several European countries and the European Union (EU). The BMGF made a first infusion to CEPI of US$ 460 million. CEPI also receives funding from Norway and India and is also heavily supported by the pharma-industry.According to CEPI’s website, CEPI has appealed for US$ 2 billion to support the development of a vaccine for COVID-19 and to expand the number of vaccine candidates to increase the chances of success and to fund the clinical trials for these candidate vaccines. CEPI’s ambition is to have at least three vaccine candidates, which could be submitted to regulatory authorities for licensing for general use/use in outbreaks.“Governments around the world will need to invest billions of euros more in coronavirus vaccine development, to take forward some promising candidates that are emerging.  – It’s a very risky business – everything is being done in parallel, you’re not building on the expertise of others – but good progress is being made,” said Melanie Saville, director of vaccine research and development at CEPI.CEPI has already some preselected international pharma corporations to research and work on a COVID-19 vaccine. They include the biotech “Moderna” in Seattle, not far from the Microsoft Headquarters – also a Bill Gates creation; the biotech lab Inovio, the University of Queensland, Australia, and the Germans, BioNTech and CureVac.rom the outset it looks that Moderna, CureVac and BioNTech are best suited to produce fast a vaccine, because according to a Health and Science report, published on March 17, 2020, “all three of these firms specialize in messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics. These mRNA molecules are used to instruct the body to produce its own immune response to fight a range of different diseases. This type of vaccine can potentially be developed and produced more quickly than traditional vaccines.”Enters GAVI – the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization has also been created by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It is a global health partnership of public and private sector organizations, dedicated to “immunization for all”. GAVI is supported by WHO, and needless to say, its main partners and sponsors are the pharma-industry. GAVI has already announced it needs billions of dollars to support its COVID-19 vaccination program. In June 2020, the UK Government will sponsor a donor conference in support of GAVI’s COVID-19 vaccination program, expecting to raise US$ 7.3 billion.From this maze of overlapping organizations, activities and unclear responsibilities, the money-flow is likely going to be a crisscross that nobody can follow. Accountability on a large scale will be lost.As to the output – hopefully a vaccine – or several vaccines. For the layman and potential patient, it will be a matter of luck (or bad luck) what cocktail of biological substances will be injected into his or her body. In any case, the long-term outcome, is unpredictable. Remember, Bill Gates has been pursuing during the last fifteen or twenty years his own very special agenda. It is unlikely he will abandon it now. Rather COVID-19 and the ensuing vaccination program will allow him to enhance it.Concluding – it is amply clear that this is a huge money-making and public-rip-off proposition by the pharma industry. What makes this multi-billion-dollar scam even worse, is that it has an official rubber-stamp, by being supported by western governments and international organizations, foremost WHO, UNICEF and the World Bank.This may be the last opportunity for the elite, the 0.1%, to shuffle social capital and worker funded assets from the bottom to the top, before we enter an era of total control through electromagnetic fields (EMF), managed by the minions of the 0.1% and with 5G / 6G technology, where we, the remaining humans may have become mere tele-guided robots.It is by now a pipe dream to believe that the world may continue as it did until the end of the last decade. It would be too much of a coincidence that Agenda ID2020 started activating its evil programs exactly at the beginning of the decade 2020. Unfortunately, it is also a far-away dream that China and Cuba could lead the way for finding a cure for the most likely recurring coronavirus in one mutation or another – including but not exclusively, using traditional methods and remedies that have proven successful in the current battle to control COVID-19.There are draconian measures on the way, and we may just pray that they fail, or that we, the people, awake in time and in sufficient numbers – a critical mass – and find back to our innermost voice and soul – solidarity for each other that gives us strength to fight this Luciferian monster.\n",

      "Washington benefits from new SARS unsettling major competitors. Prior to the advent of the 2019-nCoV coronavirus, the so-called “first package” of the US-China trade agreement, which was signed on behalf of the Celestial Empire by Vice-Premier of the State Council of the PRC Liu He, was a tactical move that would allow China to take a break. And there is the presidential election in the United States, and it remains to be seen whether Donald Trump will be able to gain a foothold in the Oval Office for a second term ... But it looks like a malicious virus that has matured either in the stomachs of bats or in a snake’s gut has confused all the cards to a friend Xi Jinping.Against the background of alarming reports from the Chinese province of Hubei (when this material was being prepared, more than 4.5 thousand people fell ill with pneumonia, and 106 died, and these are not final numbers. - Auth.) Copper and iron ore prices collapsed.Copper cheaper ten days in a row, and yesterday the price fell by 1.5% - up to 5834.5 dollars per ton. Iron ore futures are falling in price, on Tuesday at the Singapore auction they offered 85 dollars per ton - a decrease of 6.4%. But, as Bloomberg predicts, $ 80 per tonne is not such a distant prospect. Prices for black gold also plummeted - April futures for the North Sea Brent oil mix were already trading below $ 58 per barrel.At the same time, the Fitch rating agency cautiously reports that the spread of coronavirus will first of all have a negative impact on the economies of Thailand, Vietnam and Singapore, since in these countries the most vulnerable regions to the epidemics are tourism and the service sector. The statement is indisputable - everyone will get it, and yet China, presumably, is more than others, since it is the Chinese economy that is the main consumer of both metals and energy resources, and tourism with services is not the last source of replenishment of the treasury. And since the prices of these goods went down, the Chinese economy also caught the “virus”. And it’s easier to negotiate with a “sick” client, which is well known even without Trump.It is noteworthy that 2019-nCoV got to the American technological giant Apple, whose production facilities are located just 500 kilometers from the “homeland” of the coronavirus - the Wuhan metropolis. And now, according to the Nikkei Asian Review, the production of popular iPhone smartphones is in jeopardy. Starbucks also found itself in a difficult situation, which, due to quarantine, had to close a large half of its four thousand coffee houses operating in China (by the way, this is the second largest market after the United States). But at the same time, the Americans for some reason do not look like such victims of the epidemic, especially Apple, whose leadership at the very beginning of the trade and economic confrontation with China advised to evacuate production facilities in the United States. It seems as if President Trump saw everything in advance, like Wolf Messing or old Wang. However, both Apple and Starbucks were really out of luck. You can’t say the same about the American political establishment, which is making titanic efforts to bring to its knees the \"presumptuous China.\" And why should these efforts necessarily be economic in nature? The main question is - who benefits from another SARS unsettling a competitor? If we apply the well-known trick highly likely, unceremoniously used by the British ex-prime minister Theresa May to hang the so-called Skripals poisoning in Russia, then the answer is obvious: the coronavirus epidemic 2019-nCoV, which hit China, is highly likely on the hand of the United States. And the worse for Beijing, the better for Washington. Moreover, the outlook for the epidemic is not yet encouraging. For example, some experts argue: if the spread of 2019-nCoV cannot be stopped, up to 250 million Chinese can become victims of the virus, which is almost two in number in Russia.By the way, about the prospects. The Cepi Global Vaccine Coalition has reportedly invested a total of $ 12.5 million in three projects, in which researchers are ready to expeditiously develop the 2019-nCoV vaccine.Scientists from the Australian University of Queensland, as well as two American biotechnology companies Inovio and Moderna, participate in the work. The American National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is also involved. And it seems that microbiologists from Hong Kong have already developed a vaccine against the new coronavirus, as Professor of Hong Kong University Ewan Kwok-Jung hastened to inform the newspaper South China Morning Post. But her research, he claims, could take more than a year. German Shipulin, the deputy director of the Center for Strategic Planning of the Russian Ministry of Health, does not promise an imminent victory over 2019-nCoV. So the hands of the coronavirus 2019-nCoV can be considered as yet untied, and there are suspicions that the United States may be involved in this epidemic. In the Russian media, this assumption has already been made.\n",
      "US operations as part of a biological warfare against the entire planet.As a result of the dengue epidemic in Cuba from 1978-1981, up to 500 thousand people were affected. Fidel Castro said this was the result of an American biological attack. Washington did not confirm or refute the allegations of the Cuban leader.Pentagon bio laboratories exist in 25 countries around the world. They are funded by the Military Threat Reduction Agency under a $ 2.1 billion military program. The joint biological interaction program includes laboratories located in the countries of the former Soviet Union, such as Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, as well as in the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Africa. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.By the location of these biological laboratories, we can confidently indicate the four countries and territories against which the American biological threats are now directed, these are Russia, Iran, China and the countries of Central and West Africa. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.The American company CH2M Hill, under contracts for the Pentagon bio-laboratories in Georgia, Uganda, Tanzania, Iraq, Afghanistan, Southeast Asia, was funded in the amount of $ 341.5 million. Of this amount, almost half ($ 161.1 million) was allocated for research in Lugar Center in Tbilisi. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.Its subcontractor, the private company Battelle, has worked in Pentagon bio labs in Afghanistan, Armenia, Georgia, Uganda, Tanzania, Iraq, Afghanistan and Vietnam. Battelle conducts research, development, testing and evaluation of the use of both highly toxic chemicals and highly pathogenic biological agents for a wide range of US government agencies. The company entered into federal contracts totaling $ 2 billion and ranks 23rd in the list of 100 best US state contractors. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.The Pentagon has a very long history of using insects as carriers of disease. According to a partially declassified US Army report of 1981, American scientists conducted a series of experiments on insects. These operations were part of the US Entomological War as part of a biological weapons program. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.The report reported two scenarios: 16 simultaneous attacks on the city by A. Aegypti mosquitoes infected with yellow fever, as well as Tularemia aerosol attack, and assessed their effectiveness in cash and loss of life. The results were very cynical. Pentagon experts were able to \"kill\" 625 thousand people at a cost of $ 0.29 per unit. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.Operation Big Itch: Field trials were carried out to determine the coverage and survivability of tropical rat fleas Xenopsylla cheopis for use as a disease carrier in biological warfare. In Ashington neither confirmed nor refuted this information.Operation Big Buzz: 1 million A. Aegypti mosquitoes were raised. One third of them were placed in ammunition, dropped from aircraft and scattered on the ground. Mosquitoes survived in the air and actively sought human blood. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.Operations on military experiments with tropical mosquitoes and ticks in Georgia. These types of mosquitoes and fleas (which were studied in the past as part of the US Entomological War Program) were imported into Georgia and tested at the Lugar Center. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.Anthrax is one of the biological agents in service with the US Army, not only in the past. Despite Pentagon claims that this program is only defensive, there are facts to the contrary. In 2016, at the Lugar Center, American scientists conducted the study “Genome Sequence of the Soviet / Russian Bacillus anthracis Vaccine Strain 55-VNIIVViM” (the sequence of the Soviet / Russian anthracite cancer vaccine in Russia), which was funded by the US Agency for Biological Weapons Sharing Program Threat Reduction (DTRA) in Tbilisi, and implemented by Metabiota. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is caused by the tick-borne virus Nairovirus (Nairovirus). The disease was first described in Crimea in 1944 and was called Crimean hemorrhagic fever. Later, it caused an epidemic in the Congo in 1969. In 2014, 34 people were infected with the CCHF, including a 4-year-old child, three of whom died. Pentagon biologists are currently studying the virus in Georgia as part of the DTRA project, Epidemiology of febrile illnesses caused by Dengue viruses and other Arboviruses in Georgia. The project included trials on patients with fever symptoms and collection of ticks as possible distributors of CCHV for laboratory analysis. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.Similar CCHV outbreaks occurred in Afghanistan, where there are 3 Pentagon bio labs. As of December 2017, 237 cases of CCHV were reported in this country, 41 of which were fatal. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.Bats are also being investigated as a carrier of various diseases at the Lugar Center, which scientists say are carriers of the Ebola virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and other deadly diseases. As of June 2017, 1980 cases were recorded with 699 deaths in 19 countries worldwide caused by MERS-CoV. This virus is designed and manufactured in the USA. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.Another weapon of bioterrorism is, according to a 1981 US Army report, Tularemia developed in the USA, or Rabbit Fever. New tularemia carriers, such as ticks and rodents, are currently being developed. DTRA has launched a number of projects on Tularemia and in Georgia at the Lugar Center. Highly pathogenic agents (EDP) can be used for military purposes. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.\n",
      "Ukraine itself does not have control over military biological laboratories on its territory. Under the 2005 Agreement between the US Department of Defense and the Department of Health of Ukraine, the Ukrainian government is prohibited from publicly disclosing confidential information about the US program. Ukraine is also required to transfer all dangerous pathogens to the US Department of Defense for biological research. Under this Agreement, the Pentagon was granted access to many state secrets of Ukraine. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.The Pentagon has invested at least $ 65 million in gene editing research. The U.S. Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has provided seven research teams to develop tools for altering the genome of insects, rodents, and bacteria through the DARPA Safe Gene program using new CRISPR-Cas9 technology. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.The worst biological weapon that may have already been used and possibly used in Russia is, again, perhaps used against the “enemy” of the USA - China. Until recently, ethnic biological weapons (biogenetic weapons) were theoretical weapons, the purpose of which is, first of all, to harm people of certain ethnic groups or genotypes (Russians, Chinese, etc.). Although officially the research and development of ethnic bio-weapons has never been publicly confirmed, documents show that the United States collects biological materials from certain ethnic groups - Russians and Chinese. American National Socialism in its purest form.US Air Force specifically collects samples of Russian DNA and synovial tissue, which causes concern in Moscow about a hidden American program for the use of biological weapons.Senator Franz Klintsevich commented on the words of President Vladimir Putin about the purposeful collection of Russian biomaterial: “In the West, everything is done very scrupulously and verified to the smallest detail: if we use biological weapons, then surely ... The relevant services in the West should know that we are aware of their interest. Let those who are engaged in this work on the territory of the Russian Federation not be offended. ”And it cannot be said that such suspicions have no reason. As you know, the United States ratified the Geneva Protocol and the Biological Weapons Convention back in 1975. But the biological games overseas have not stopped, and not only in the national territory. Already after the collapse of the USSR, American biological laboratories appeared, which is precisely established in Georgia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan. Where else - except that the State Department knows that it is, they say, absolutely peaceful organizations involved in the development of medicines. But if they are so peaceful, then why, one wonders, did the Americans build them not at home, but at the other end of the world?And the participants of the “visiting” American biological project are very specialized. For example, the US Army Institute of Infectious Disease Medical Research (USAMRIID, Fort Detrick), the Military Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), which is a division of the Pentagon, the Central Asian and Caucasian Biosafety Association, which monitors the biological potential of the CIS countries, the Biological Threat Reduction Program (Nunn-Lugar program) and so on.Comments, as they say, are unnecessary. Not so long ago, the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation analyzed documents on the activities of the so-called \"health center\" that the Americans built in Georgia, and came to the conclusion: in fact, this is a \"death factory\", which killed 73 people who were used by overseas biologists as experimental rabbits. But the fact of the matter is that American bio-laboratories are scattered not only around Russia, but also around the world, where America has its own interests.And another question, where did the 2019-nCoV coronavirus originate - in a bat or in some American \"health center\"? Where is it more highly likely?Coronavirus: US biological warfare against Russia and China\n",

      "Last year a mysterious shipment was caught smuggling Coronavirus from Canada. It was traced to Chinese agents working at a Canadian lab. Subsequent investigation by GreatGameIndia linked the agents to Chinese Biological Warfare Program from where the virus is suspected to have leaked causing the Wuhan Coronavirus outbreak.On June 13, 2012 a 60-year-old Saudi man was admitted to a private hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, with a 7-day history of fever, cough, expectoration, and shortness of breath. He had no history of cardiopulmonary or renal disease, was receiving no long-term medications, and did not smoke.Egyptian virologist Dr. Ali Mohamed Zaki isolated and identified a previously unknown coronavirus from his lungs. After routine diagnostics failed to identify the causative agent, Zaki contacted Ron Fouchier, a leading virologist at the Erasmus Medical Center (EMC) in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, for advice.Fouchier sequenced the virus from a sample sent by Zaki. Fouchier used a broad-spectrum “pan-coronavirus” real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method to test for distinguishing features of a number of known coronaviruses known to infect humans.This Coronavirus sample was acquired by Scientific Director Dr. Frank Plummer of Canada’s National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) in Winnipeg directly from Fouchier, who received it from Zaki. This virus was reportedly stolen from the Canadian lab by Chinese agents.The Canadian Lab. Coronavirus arrived at Canada’s NML Winnipeg facility on May 4, 2013 from the Dutch lab. The Canadian lab grew up stocks of the virus and used it to assess diagnostic tests being used in Canada. Winnipeg scientists worked to see which animal species can be infected with the new virus.Research was done in conjunction with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency’s national lab, the National Centre for Foreign Animal Diseases which is housed in the same complex as the National Microbiology Laboratory.NML has a long history of offering comprehensive testing services for coronaviruses. It isolated and provided the first genome sequence of the SARS coronavirus and identified another coronavirus NL63 in 2004.This Winnipeg based Canadian lab was targeted by Chinese agents in what could be termed as Biological Espionage.Chinese Biological Espionage. In March 2019, in mysterious event a shipment of exceptionally virulent viruses from Canada’s NML ended up in China. The event caused a major scandal with Bio-warfare experts questioning why Canada was sending lethal viruses to China. Scientists from NML said the highly lethal viruses were a potential bio-weapon.Following investigation, the incident was traced to Chinese agents working at NML. Four months later in July 2019, a group of Chinese virologists were forcibly dispatched from the Canadian National Microbiology Laboratory (NML). The NML is Canada’s only level-4 facility and one of only a few in North America equipped to handle the world’s deadliest diseases, including Ebola, SARS, Coronavirus, etc.The NML scientist who was escorted out of the Canadian lab along with her husband, another biologist, and members of her research team is believed to be a Chinese Bio-Warfare agent Xiangguo Qiu. Qiu was the head of the Vaccine Development and Antiviral Therapies Section in the Special Pathogens Program at Canada’s NML.Xiangguo Qiu is an outstanding Chinese scientist born in Tianjin. She primarily received her medical doctor degree from Hebei Medical University in China in 1985 and came to Canada for graduate studies in 1996. Later on, she was affiliated with the Institute of Cell Biology and the Department of Pediatrics and Child Health of the University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, not engaged with studying pathogens.But a shift took place, somehow. Since 2006, she has been studying powerful viruses in Canada’s NML. The viruses shipped from the NML to China were studied by her in 2014, for instance (together with the viruses Machupo, Junin, Rift Valley Fever, Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever and Hendra).Infiltrating the Canadian Lab.Dr. Xiangguo Qiu is married to another Chinese scientist – Dr. Keding Cheng, also affiliated with the NML, specifically the “Science and Technology Core”. Dr. Cheng is primarily a bacteriologist who shifted to virology. The couple is responsible for infiltrating Canada’s NML with many Chinese agents as students from a range of Chinese scientific facilities directly tied to China’s Biological Warfare Program, namely:Institute of Military Veterinary, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Changchun. Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Chengdu Military Region. Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hubei. Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing. All of the above four mentioned Chinese Biological Warfare facilities collaborated with Dr. Xiangguo Qiu within the context of Ebola virus, the Institute of Military Veterinary joined a study on the Rift Valley fever virus too, while the Institute of Microbiology joined a study on Marburg virus. Noticeably, the drug used in the latter study – Favipiravir – has been earlier tested successfully by the Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences, with the designation JK-05 (originally a Japanese patent registered in China already in 2006), against Ebola and additional viruses.However, the studies by Dr. Qiu are considerably more advanced and apparently vital for the Chinese biological weapons development in case Coronavirus, Ebola, Nipah, Marburg or Rift Valley fever viruses are included therein.The Canadian investigation is ongoing and questions remain whether previous shipments to China of other viruses or other essential preparations, took place from 2006 to 2018, one way or another.Dr. Xiangguo Qiu also collaborated in 2018 with three scientists from the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, Maryland, studying post-exposure immunotherapy for two Ebola viruses and Marburg virus in monkeys; a study supported by the US Defense Threat Reduction Agency.The Wuhan Coronavirus.Dr. Xiangguo Qiu made at least five trips over the school year 2017-18 to the above mentioned Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which was certified for BSL4 in January 2017. Moreover, in August 2017, the National Health Commission of China approved research activities involving Ebola, Nipah, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses at the Wuhan facility.Coincidentally, the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory is located only 20 miles away from the Huanan Seafood Market which is the epicenter of the Coronavirus outbreak dubbed the Wuhan Coronavirus.The Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory is housed at the Chinese military facility Wuhan Institute of Virology linked to China’s Biological Warfare Program. It was the first ever lab in the country designed to meet biosafety-level-4 (BSL-4) standards – the highest biohazard level, meaning that it would be qualified to handle the most dangerous pathogens. In January 2018, the lab was operational ‘for global experiments on BSL-4 pathogens,’ wrote Guizhen Wu in the journal Biosafety and Health. ‘After a laboratory leak incident of SARS in 2004, the former Ministry of Health of China initiated the construction of preservation laboratories for high-level pathogens such as SARS, coronavirus, and pandemic influenza virus,’ wrote Guizhen Wu.Coronavirus Bioweapon.The Wuhan institute has studied coronaviruses in the past, including the strain that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, H5N1 influenza virus, Japanese encephalitis, and dengue. Researchers at the institute also studied the germ that causes anthrax – a biological agent once developed in Russia.“Coronaviruses (particularly SARS) have been studied in the institute and are probably held therein,” said Dany Shoham, a former Israeli military intelligence officer who has studied Chinese biowarfare. He said. “SARS is included within the Chinese BW program, at large, and is dealt with in several pertinent facilities.”James Giordano, a neurology professor at Georgetown University and senior fellow in Biowarfare at the U.S. Special Operations Command, said China’s growing investment in bio-science, looser ethics around gene-editing and other cutting-edge technology and integration between government and academia raise the spectre of such pathogens being weaponized. That could mean an offensive agent, or a modified germ let loose by proxies, for which only China has the treatment or vaccine. “This is not warfare, per se,” he said. “But what it’s doing is leveraging the capability to act as global saviour, which then creates various levels of macro and micro economic and bio-power dependencies.”China’s Biological Warfare Program.In a 2015 academic paper, Shoham – of Bar-Ilan’s Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies – asserts that more than 40 Chinese facilities are involved in bio-weapon production.China’s Academy of Military Medical Sciences actually developed an Ebola drug – called JK-05 — but little has been divulged about it or the defence facility’s possession of the virus, prompting speculation its Ebola cells are part of China’s bio-warfare arsenal, Shoham told the National Post.Ebola is classified as a “category A” bioterrorism agent by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, meaning it could be easily transmitted from person to person, would result in high death rates and “might cause panic.” The CDC lists Nipah as a category C substance, a deadly emerging pathogen that could be engineered for mass dissemination.China’s Biological Warfare Program is believed to be in an advanced stage that includes research and development, production and weaponization capabilities. Its current inventory is believed to include the full range of traditional chemical and biological agents with a wide variety of delivery systems including artillery rockets, aerial bombs, sprayers, and short-range ballistic missiles.Weaponizing Biotech. China’s national strategy of military-civil fusion has highlighted biology as a priority, and the People’s Liberation Army could be at the forefront of expanding and exploiting this knowledge. The PLA is pursuing military applications for biology and looking into promising intersections with other disciplines, including brain science, supercomputing, and artificial intelligence. Since 2016, the Central Military Commission has funded projects on military brain science, advanced biomimetic systems, biological and biomimetic materials, human performance enhancement, and “new concept” biotechnology.In 2016, an AMMS doctoral researcher published a dissertation, “Research on the Evaluation of Human Performance Enhancement Technology,” which characterized CRISPR-Cas as one of three primary technologies that might boost troops’ combat effectiveness. The supporting research looked at the effectiveness of the drug Modafinil, which has applications in cognitive enhancement; and at transcranial magnetic stimulation, a type of brain stimulation, while also contending that the “great potential” of CRISPR-Cas as a “military deterrence technology in which China should “grasp the initiative” in development.In 2016, the potential strategic value of genetic information led the Chinese government to launch the National Genebank, which intends to become the world’s largest repository of such data. It aims to “develop and utilize China’s valuable genetic resources, safeguard national security in bioinformatics, and enhance China’s capability to seize the strategic commanding heights” in the domain of Biotechnology Warfare.Chinese military’s interest in biology as an emerging domain of warfare is guided by strategists who talk about potential “genetic weapons” and the possibility of a “bloodless victory.”\n",

      "THE STORY:The China Coronavirus COVID-19 rose to public attention late December 2019, but certain events October 2019 either planned for or precipitated it – such as the rollout of 5G in Wuhan.THE IMPLICATIONS:What is the coronavirus-5G connection? Is this bioweapon an excuse for mandatory vaccination, including DNA vaccines, which can be injected using a technique very similar to the EMF pulsed waves of 5G? The China Coronavirus 5G Connection is a very important factor when trying to comprehend the coronavirus (formerly abbreviated 2019-nCoV, now COVID-19) outbreak. Various independent researchers around the web, for around 2-3 weeks now, have highlighted the coronavirus-5G link despite the fact that Google (as the self-appointed NWO Censor-in-Chief) is doing its best to hide and scrub all search results showing the connection. The coronavirus 5G connection doesn’t mean the bioweapons connection is false (it’s not a case of either-or), but rather broadens the scope of the entire event. Wuhan was one of the test cities chosen for China 5G rollout; 5G went live there on October 31st, 2019, almost exactly 2 months before the coronavirus outbreak began. Meanwhile, many scientific documents on the health effects of 5G have verified that it causes flu-like symptoms. This article reveals the various connections behind the coronavirus phenomenon, including how 5G can exacerbate or cause the kind of illness you are attributing to the new virus. The rabbit hole is deep so let’s take a dive.5G – A Type of Directed Energy Weapon.For the deeper background to 5G, read my 2017 article 5G and IoT: Total Technological Control Grid Being Rolled Out Fast. Many people around the world, including concerned citizens, scientists and even governmental officials, are becoming aware of the danger of 5G. This is why it has already been banned in many places worldwide, such as Brussels, the Netherlands and parts of Switzerland, Ireland, Italy, Germany, the UK, the USA and Australia. After all, 5G is not just the next generation of mobile connectivity after 4G; it is a radical and entirely new type of technology – a military technology used on the battlefield that is now being ‘deployed’ (military term) in the civilian realm. It is phased array weaponry being sold and disguised as primarily a communications system when the frequency bands it uses (24GHz – 100+GHz including MMW [millimeter waves]) are the very same ones used in Active Denial Systems, i.e. crowd control. Even mainstream Wikipedia describes Active Denial Systems as directed energy weaponry; it disperses crowds by firing energy at them, causing immediate and intense pain, including a sensation of the skin burning. Remember, directed energy weapons (DEW) are behind the fall of the Twin Towers on 9/11 and the fake Californian ‘wildfires’.Numerous scientists have warned of the dangerous health effects of 5G. For instance, in this 5G Appeal from 2017 entitled Scientists and Doctors Warn of Potential Serious Health Effects of 5G, scientists warned of the harmful of non-ionizing RF/EMF radiation:If you listen to Mark Steele and Barrie Trower, you’ll get an idea of the horrifying effects of 5G. In this interview, Trower echoes the above quote by stating how 5G damages the immune system of trees and kills insects. He reveals how in 1977, 5G was tested on animals in hopes of finding a weapon. The results were severe demyelination – stripping the protective sheath of nerve cells. Some nations are now noticing a 90% loss of insects (including pollinating insects like bees) which congregate around lamp-posts where 5G is installed. \n",
      "Wuhan Military Games and Event 201 Simulation.If you dig deep enough, some disturbing connections arise between 5G and the men who have developed or are developing vaccines for novel viruses like ebola, zika and the new coronavirus COVID-19. In a fantastic piece of research, an author under the pen name of Annie Logical wrote the article Corona Virus Fakery And The Link To 5G Testing that lays out the coronavirus 5G connection. There is a ton of information, so I will break it all down to make it more understandable.From October 18-27th 2019, Wuhan hosted the Military World Games and specifically used 5G (for the first time ever) for the event. Also on October 18th, 2019 in New York, the Johns Hopkins Center in partnership with World Economic Forum (WEF) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation hosted Event 201 – “A Global Pandemic Exercise” which is a simulation of a pandemic. Guess what virus they happen to choose for their ‘simulation’? A coronavirus! Guess what animal cells they use? Pig cells! (COVID-19 was initially reported to be derived from a seafood market, and the fish there are known to be fed on pig waste). Event 201 includes the UN (since the WEF now has a partnership agreement with UN), Big Pharma (Johnson and Johnson), Bill Gates (key figure in pushing vaccines, human microchipping and Agenda 2030) and both China and America’s CDC. Participants in Event 201 recommended that governments force social media companies to stop the spread of ‘fake news’ and that ultimately the only way to control the information would be for the WHO (World Health Organization, part of the UN) to be the sole central purveyor of information during a pandemic.Inovio, Electroporation and 5G.As reported on January 24th, 2020, US biotech and pharmaceutical company Inovio received a $9 million grant to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus. Inovio got the money grant from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), however they already have an existing partnership with CEPI; in April 2018 they got up to $56 million to develop vaccines for Lassa Fever and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). CEPI was founded in Davos by the governments of Norway and India, the Wellcome Trust … and the participants of Event 201: the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the WEF. CEPI’s CEO is the former director of BARDA (US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority) which is part of the HHS. Inovio claimed they developed a coronavirus vaccine in 2 hours! On the face of it such a claim is absurd; what is more likely is that they are lying or that they already had the vaccine because they had the foreknowledge that the coronavirus was coming and was about to be unleashed.So who owns and runs Inovio? Two key men are David Weiner and Dr. Joseph Kim. Weiner was once Kim’s university professor. Weiner was involved with developing a vaccine for HIV and zika (you can read my articles about zika here and here where I exposed some of the lies surrounding that epidemic). Kim was funded by Merck (a large Big Pharma company) and produced something called Porcine Circovirus (PCV 1 and PCV 2). As mentioned above, there is a link between pig vaccines/pig DNA and the coronavirus; Annie Logical notes that it “has long been established that seafood in the area is fed on pig waste.” Kim served a 5-year tenure as a member of the WEF’s Global Agenda Council – yet another organ pushing the New World Order One World Government under the banner of Agenda 2030 Global Governance.Weiner is an employee and advisor to the FDA, is considered a DNA technology expert and pioneered a new DNA transference method called electroporation – a microbiology technique which uses an electrical pulse to create temporary pores in cell membranes through which substances like chemicals, drugs or DNA can be introduced into the cell. This technique can be used to administer DNA vaccines, which inject foreign DNA into a host’s cells that changes the host’s DNA. This means if you take a DNA vaccine, you are allowing your DNA to be changed! As if vaccines weren’t already horrific enough … but here’s the kicker: electroporation uses pulsed waves. Guess what else uses pulsed waves? 5G! This is either a startling coincidence or evidence or a sinister coronavirus 5G-connection. [T]he same action that 5G technology uses in pulsed waves and the coronavirus was reported to have started in an area in China that had rolled out 5G technology! So we can see how geneticists using scientists are tampering with the building blocks of our existence and what is disturbing is that Prof Wiener is a HIV pioneer and we know that soon after the Polio vaccines were given to millions in Africa that HIV emerged. They have perfected the art of injecting animal or bird DNA into human chromosomes which alters our DNA and causes things like haemorrhaging, fever, cancers and even death.”Speaking of HIV (which is not the same things as AIDS, but that is another story), remember also that a group of Indian scientists put out their research that the virus was manmade and had HIV inserts. They found that 4 separate HIV genes were randomly embedded within the coronavirus. These genes somehow converged to create receptor sites on the virus that were identical to HIV, which was a surprise due to their random placement. They also specifically stated that this was not likely to happen naturally (“unlikely to be fortuitous in nature”). In yet another example of egregious censorship, these scientists were pressured to withdraw their work.5G and Electroporation DNA Vaccines – Both Producing Pulsed EMF Waves. Consider the implications of this for a moment. The technology exists to use EMFs to open your very skin pores and inject foreign DNA into your bloodstream and cells. This is an extreme violation of your bodily sovereignty, and it can have long-term effects, because of genetic mutation – changing your very DNA which is the biological blueprint and physical essence of who you are.What if 5G mimics electroporation? What if 5G can do on a large scale what electroporation does on a small scale? We already know that 5G has the potential to be mutagenic (DNA-damaging). The frequencies that 5G uses, especially 75-100GHz, interact with the geometrical structure of our skin and sweat ducts, acting upon them like a transmission reaching an antenna, and fundamentally affecting us and our mood.What if 5G is being used to open up the skin of those in Wuhan so as to allow the new bioweapon coronavirus to infiltrate more easily?Mandatory Vaccines, Depopulation and Transhumanism.So, what’s at the bottom of the coronavirus-5G connection rabbit hole? I would suggest we find mandatory vaccine agenda, the depopulation agenda and transhumanist agenda (via DNA vaccines). The key figures and groups who appear to have planned this already have the vaccine in place, just as they did for the other epidemics that fizzled out (SARS, ebola and zika). Weiner even has links to HIV/AIDS, and if you dive into that as Jon Rappoport did, you find gaping holes in that story.It’s the same epidemic/pandemic game played out every 2-3 years. There’s a couple of versions. In the first version, you invent a virus, hype it up, get people scared, do ineffectual and inconclusive tests (e.g. like the PCR test which measures if a viral fragment is present but doesn’t tell you the quantities of whether it would actually causing the disease), inflate the body count, justify quarantine/martial law and brainwash people into thinking they have to buy the (toxic) vaccine and introduce mandatory vaccination. You don’t even need a real virus or pathogen for the version. In the second version, you create a virus as a bioweapon, release it as a test, pretend it was a natural mutation, watch how many people it kills (which helps with the eugenics and depopulation agendas), again justify martial law, again justify the need for mandatory vaccines and even pose as the savior with the vaccine that stops it. As a variation on this second version, you can even develop a race-specific bioweapon so as to reduce the population of rival nations or enemy races as a geopolitical strategy. This article suggests that the coronavirus targets Chinese people/Asians more than others, and certainly the official death count attests to that, although it’s always hard to trust governmental statistics. Annie Logical gives her take:The con job goes like this.poison the population purposely to create disease that does not and would never occur naturally. parlay the purposely created disease as being caused by something invisible, outside the realm of control or knowledge of the average person, create a toxic vaccine or medication that was always intended to further poison the population into an early grave. parlay the vaccine or medication poisoning as PROOF the disease, which never existed, is much worse than anticipated. increase the initial poisoning, which is marketed as a fake disease, and also increase the vaccine and medication poisoning, to start piling the bodies into the stratosphere. repeat as many times as possible upon an uninformed population because killing a population this way (the art of having people line up to kill themselves with poison……known as a “soft kill” method) is the only legal way to make sure such eugenic operations can be executed on mass and in plain sight.“DNA vaccines are a disturbing new advancement for transhumanism. After all, the objective of the transhumanist agenda is to merge man with machine, and in doing so, wipe out what fundamentally makes us human, so we can be controlled and overtaken by a deeply sinister and negative force. It’s all about changing us at the fundamental level, or attacking human sovereignty itself. DNA vaccines fit right in with that – literally changing your DNA by forcefully inserting foreign DNA to change your genetics, with consequences no one could possibly fully foresee and predict.One Last Coronavirus-5G Connection. Finally, I will finish with another coronavirus-5G connection. The word coronavirus itself refers to many kinds of viruses by that name, not just COVID-19. Guess who owns a patent for a coronavirus strain (not SARS CoV2 or COVID-19) that can be used to develop a vaccine? The Pirbright Institute.  And guess who partially owns them? Bill Gates! As you can read here Pirbright is being supported in their vaccine developement endeavors by a British company Innovate UK … who also funds and supports the rollout of 5G. Innovate UK ran a competition in 2018 with a £15 million share out to any small business that could produce vaccines for ‘epidemic’ potential.The Motivation to Hype and the Motivation to Downplay. History has shown that in cases of epidemics (or fake epidemics) there is almost always a morass of conflicting reports and contradictory information. In such situations, it can be very difficult to get to the bottom of the matter and find the truth. The conflict stems from the different motivations of nations, governments and other interested groups. Essentially, there are 2 main motivations: the motivation to hype (exaggerate and use fear to grab attention, sell something, make a group look bad/incompetent, make people scared, make the public accept mandatory vaccination and martial law) and the motivation to downplay (cover up and hide the true extent of the damage, morbidity or mortality so as to appear competent and in control, to lessen possible anger, backlash or disorder). Sometimes, these 2 motivations may drive the behavior of the same group, e.g. in the case of the Chinese Government, it has the motivation to hype (to get people afraid so they easily follow its draconian quarantine rules) and the motivation to downplay (so as to appear in the eyes of its people and the rest of the entire world to have the situation under control, to ensure saving face, credibility and a good reputation).\n",
      "Final Thoughts on the Coronavirus 5G Connection. Governments around the world have experimented with bioweapons both on their own citizens and foreign citizens, and even sold that research to other governments for their own benefit (e.g. Japan’s notorious Unit 731 which developed bioweapons in China, only to hand over that research to the US after losing World War 2). See Bioweapons: Lyme Disease, Weaponized Ticks, Plum Island & More for a brief history of the USG’s usage of weaponized ticks which resulted in Lyme Disease. The evidence that COVID-19 is a bioweapon is overwhelming – and so is the evidence that 5G is involved to either cause the flu-like symptoms/pneumonia people have been experiencing, and/or to exacerbate the virulence of the virus by weakening people’s immune systems and subjecting them to pulsed waves of EMF to open up their skin to foreign DNA fragments (including viruses).\n",

On the up side, China “appeared to be over the worst” of it, CBS said.All told, as of March 5, 2020, there were 98067 reported cases of novel coronavirus infections affecting 88 countries, 80430 of which were in China.

In fact, Boyle was the one who called for biowarfare legislation at the Biological Weapons Convention of 1972, and the one who drafted the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989, which was passed unanimously by both houses of Congress and signed into law by George Bush, Sr.At the time of this recording, February 14, 2020, more than 50000 people in China had been infected with the virus. Certainly, it does not originate from infected bat soup.As a result of Boyle's antibiological warfare work, which goes back to the early days of the Reagan administration — a time in which they were using DNA genetic engineering to manufacture biological weapons — Boyle has carefully followed \"mysterious outbreaks of disease in both humans and animals around the world\" that have appeared since then.\"My biowarfare antiterrorism act was specifically designed to not only to deal with regular biological weapons but also with DNA genetic engineering for biological weapons that was just coming into its infancy when the BWC was being drafted.Even though the BWC would cover DNA genetic engineering, I wanted to make it clear by name that it was covered. I also made it clear [that] it covered synthetic biology as well,\" Boyle says.\"So, when these unexplained mysterious illnesses break out, I monitor them a while and usually I just conclude they can be explained by normal reasons: lack of sanitation, poverty, things of that nature. But in Wuhan it seemed pretty suspicious to me.There is this Biosafety Level 4 facility there in Wuhan. It's the first in China, and it was specifically set up to deal with the coronavirus and SARS. SARS is basically a weaponized version of the coronavirus.There have been leaks before of SARS out of this facility, and indeed the only reason for these BSL-4 facilities, based on my experience, is the research, development, testing and stockpiling of offensive biological weapons.For that reason, I stated my opinion: That this Wuhan coronavirus leaked out of that BSL-4 facility … maybe mid-November … and the Chinese government has been lying about it and covering up ever since.\"Many Unknowns Remain. The first reported case of COVID-19 infection was December 1, 2019. Depending on the incubation period, which is still unknown, the initial lead, provided there was one, might have occurred anywhere in November. The official estimate is a 14-day incubation period, but a British health expert believes it's 24 days, and North Korean biological warfare experts believe it's 30 days, Boyle says.\"As for Wuhan and Hubei Province, they're basically under martial law. There's no other word for it. If you read the statements by President Xi and his assistants, they've made it very clear they're at war here, and that is correct. They're at war with their own biological warfare agent.President Xi just fired the party apparatchiks in charge of this and has brought in trusted military personnel to handle it, as well as large numbers of PLA [People's Liberation Army] forces saying they're health care workers. They don't look like health care workers to me. So, as of now, that's my best reading of the situation.\"\n",
      "When asked about rumors the COVID-19 virus might have been stolen from a high-security laboratory in Winnipeg, Canada, Boyle says:\"It could have been. I want to make it clear that, in my opinion they were already working on that at the Wuhan BSL-4 facility. They were working on a biological warfare weapon involving SARS, which is a coronavirus to begin with.We do know that Dr. [Yoshihiro] Kawaoka at the University of Wisconsin … resurrected the Spanish flu virus for the Pentagon, obviously for weapons purposes, and he specializes in mating the Spanish flu virus to all sorts of hideous biowarfare instrumentalities. And there was a record of him shipping his products to Winnipeg.\n",
      "Winnipeg is Canada's equivalent of our own Fort Detrick. It's a BSL-4 facility, and yes, they research, develop tests, manufacture and stockpile every type of hideous biological warfare weapon that we know of. So, some of this technology could have been stolen from Winnipeg. I don't know about that but, as I said, the Wuhan BSL-4 was already working on this to begin with.They had already developed SARS. SARS had leaked out two to three times before this, and it seems they were turbocharging SARS, which is what [COVID-19] looks to be. This is a brand-new generation of biowarfare weapons we haven't seen before.Its lethality goes from 15%, as estimated by Lancet, up to 17% to 18% by a British health official and even Chinese statistics. Its infectivity is 83%. It can infect maybe three to four people for every person infected.It has gain of function properties, which means it travels through air at least 6 or 7 feet, and … there are reports that even contaminated human feces give it off, that the human feces radiate off maybe 6 or 7 feet. So, we've never seen anything like this before in the history of biological warfare, at least in the public record.\n",
      "I want to make it clear: I have never worked for the United States government. I've never had a security clearance. I've never had access to any type of secret information.I just read what is in the public record and the scientific record and try to draw my own conclusions, and that's what I'm giving you today. I could change my opinion if people can provide me reputable scientific evidence to the contrary.Right now, I'm standing by my conclusion that it leaked out of the Wuhan BSL-4, the highest level of the Chinese government has known about it, they've been covering it up from the get-go, until they informed the WHO at the end of December.\"Despite Laws, Biowarfare Experimentation Is Alive and Well. As noted by Boyle, the Wuhan lab is a designated WHO research lab, which may sound odd, considering these facilities specialize in developing and researching dangerous pathogens that can easily be turned into bioweapons. According to Boyle, we should not be surprised however, as \"WHO is up to its eyeballs in this type of work and has been for quite some time.\" The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the drug industry also appear to have had their hand in many of the outbreaks of what appear to be weaponized viruses.\n",
      "\"I won't go through the long history of big pharma getting involved in this. There's huge amounts of money here. I believe the West Africa Ebola pandemic originated out of the US BSL-4 facility in Sierra Leone, and [that] they were testing out a so-called vaccine that contained live Ebola and gave it to these poor people,\" Boyle says.\"As for the CDC, it has been involved in every … BSL-4 biological warfare death science you could possibly imagine … It's a matter of public record that during the Reagan administration, the CDC and the American Type Culture Collection sent 40 shipments of weapons-grade biological warfare agents to Saddam Hussein in Iraq, in the hope and expectation that he would weaponize these agents and use them against Iran.Of course, the problem is that when that war was over … an order was given to U.S. military forces to blow up Saddam Hussein's biological warfare facilities, and that's not how you deal with biological warfare weapons. [It] contaminated our own troops, and that was a causative factor in the Gulf War Syndrome that … murdered about 11000 U.S. troops and disabled about 100000.\"According to Boyle, the U.S. government spent $100 billion on biological warfare programs since September 11, 2011, up until October 2015, which is no small sum. To put it into perspective, the U.S. spent $40 billion (assuming a constant dollar value) on the Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bomb. Boyle also estimates the U.S. has some 13000 life scientists working within the biowarfare industry.\"Clearly, the Reagan administration, under the influence of its neoconservatives who definitely believe in biological weapons and ethnic-specific biological weapons (you can see that in the PNAC report), were engaged in the use of DNA genetic engineering for the purpose of manufacturing biological weapons.That is why I gave a Congressional briefing in Washington, D.C. in 1985. I was asked to do that by the Council for Responsible Genetics that I work with, which involves the leading life scientists in the world from MIT and Harvard.I spent seven years at Harvard. I have three degrees and I knew all these people. They asked me to serve as their lawyer and give this Congressional briefing. I blew the whistle, and then they asked me to draft the implementing legislation, which I did.I want to make it clear I'm not here to speak in their name, I'm only speaking in my name, but if you look at my book, 'Biological Warfare and Terrorism,' professor Jonathan King wrote the foreword. So, I have the leading MIT professor of molecular biology supporting what I'm saying, if you don't think I know enough science about it.\"US Prepares for COVID-19 Pandemic. While there have so far only been a limited number of reported cases of COVID-19 infection in the U.S., the U.S. military has designated several detention sites around the country to quarantine Americans,8 should the situation take a turn for the worse.Historically speaking, however, government health officials have been vastly exaggerating the threat of pandemics in the U.S., including the bird flu, the swine flu, anthrax and Ebola.For example, as detailed in my 2009 New York Times bestseller \"The Great Bird Flu Hoax,\" then-President George Bush Jr. projected 2 million Americans would die from bird flu; the best-case scenario taking only 200000 lives. The final death count in the U.S. from that pandemic was zero.It generated massive profits, though, as U.S. taxpayer dollars were used to purchase 20 million doses of Tamiflu. One of the people who was able to line his pockets from that hoax was defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who was president of Gilead Sciences when the drug was created.\"[The bird flu] was another DNA, genetically engineered biological warfare weapon,\" Boyle notes. \"It was a chimera. It had three different elements in it and we were all lucky that somehow they attenuated the lethality and the infectiveness of the bird flu.\"Whether or not COVID-19 will be similarly ineffective in its spread and lethality remains to be seen. Judging by the statistics in China, \"it doesn't look very good,\" Boyle says.Understanding the COVID-19 Virus. According to Boyle, the COVID-19 virus is a chimera, like the avian flu virus before it. It includes SARS, an already weaponized coronavirus, along with HIV genetic material. \"That was in a published article by Indian scientists. You could see the pictures right there, [but] political pressure was brought to bear upon them so they withdrew [the paper].\"This is why some scientists are now looking into using HIV drugs to treat it,9 Boyle says. COVID-19 may also have a flu virus mixed in, along with gain of function properties that allow it to spread a greater distance than normal.Pandemics Repeatedly Used to Further Police State. Pandemics have also been used to chip away public freedoms. For example, the anthrax scare of 2001 was used as the impetus for signing the Patriot Act, which was the first step in taking away many of our personal freedoms and rolling out a complete surveillance state. To me, such outcomes are far more concerning than the risk of infection itself. Boyle adds:\"They used Amerithrax to ram the Patriot Act through, that is correct … We became a police state … And as I pointed out in 'Biowarfare and Terrorism,' I think the same people who were behind the 9/11 terrorist attack were also behind the Amerithrax, but I'm just connecting dots there. What's called Amerithrax came out of a U.S. government biological warfare weapons lab and program, and I publicly blew the whistle on that the first weekend of November 2001.The Council for Responsible Genetics was having its convention at Harvard Business School and I was chairing a panel with King and other experts on biological warfare, on U.S. biological warfare programs.As I was walking into the Harvard Divinity School, Fox TV had a camera crew there and I said, 'Obviously, this came out a U.S. biological weapons program and probably Fort Detrick.'I conducted the session and made the same comment. Then I made a comment to a Washington, D.C., radio station to that effect [and to] the BBC, so everyone in the world heard me.At that point, someone gave an order that I was never to be interviewed again by any mainstream news about biological warfare programs. And that's been the case since the first week of November 2001.\"As noted by Boyle, George Orwell's book, \"1984,\" has become reality. Boyle has since lectured lawyers at DePaul Law School in Chicago about the totalitarian nature of the Patriot Act.\"Snowden has correctly pointed out the federal government is spying on everything we say, all of our electronic communications, you name it,\" Boyle says.\"And again, the proof is I've been completely blackballed out of U.S. media. Indeed, if you go back and look at the Amerithrax attacks, they also hit mainstream U.S. media to make it clear to them that if they covered this issue they will be killed too.\"Bioweapons Are Developed To Be Used. As noted by Boyle, the U.S. government has a large stockpile of Amerithrax — a super weapons-grade nanotechnology anthrax with 1 trillion spores per gram — and that's just the tip of the iceberg of the biological weapons developed. What's more, Boyle has no doubt these weapons will eventually be put to use, as they have in the past. He says:\"There was a tabletop exercise at John Hopkins University last fall … on coronavirus.10 Tabletop exercise, that's a euphemism for a war game. Their estimate was that it killed 65 million people11. John Hopkins is up to their eyeballs in this Nazi biological warfare dirty work. They have a BSL-3 facility there … that they proudly announce on their website … They justify it by saying they're developing vaccines. OK … How do they do that?They go out around the world, and this is a matter of public record, and scour for every type of hideous disease, fungus, virus and bacteria you can possibly imagine. They then bring it back to these BSL-4 labs and develop an offensive, biological agent using DNA genetic engineering and synthetic biology … set up by the Pentagon under DARPA. Once they have this offensive agent, they then proceed to develop a vaccine, because the agent is no good unless you can have a vaccine to protect your own people.So, they're developing vaccines to have biological weapons, because a biological weapon consists of two elements: the offensive biological warfare agent in the first place, and then, second, a vaccine to protect your own people, and that is what is being done at all these BSL-4 facilities, and many of the BSL-3s as well.John Hopkins has a BSL-3 and they admit they do dual use. That's what dual use means. They first develop the offensive biological warfare agent and then they develop the supposed vaccine.\"Indeed, Johns Hopkins University is the biggest recipient of research grants from federal agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation and Department of Defense. It has also received millions of dollars in research grants from the Gates Foundation.12 In 2016, Johns Hopkins spent more than $2 billion on research projects, leading all U.S. universities in research spending for the 38th year in a row.How Can We Best Prevent or Treat COVID-19 Infection?While it's unclear exactly which treatment is the most effective, my guess is that Dr. Paul Marik's intravenous vitamin C protocol for sepsis would be a good starting point, seeing how sepsis appears to be what kills those who succumb to a serious COVID-19 infection.Marik's retrospective before-after clinical study1415 showed that giving patients IV vitamin C with hydrocortisone and vitamin B1 for two days reduced mortality from 40% to 8.5%. The precise protocol used was 200 mg of thiamine every 12 hours, 1500 mg of ascorbic acid every six hours, and 50 mg of hydrocortisone every six hours.16 Importantly, the treatment has no side effects and is inexpensive, readily available and simple to administer.According to Marik, vitamin C and corticosteroids have a synergistic effect,17 which is part of why his combo protocol is so effective. Still, simply using high-dose IV vitamin C exclusively has been shown to improve survival in patients with sepsis and acute respiratory failure, reducing mortality from 46% to 30%.It also reduced the number of days they needed to remain hospitalized. On average, those who received vitamin C had by Day 28 spent three fewer days in the intensive care unit than the placebo group (seven days compared to 10). By Day 60, the treatment group had also spent seven fewer days in the hospital overall —15 days compared to 22.19. While there are no trials that look at integrating hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), my suspicion is that this would provide a powerful synergy that could get the fatality rate from sepsis even closer to zero. Sadly, HBOT is not available at many hospitals, and even if it were, it is not approved for sepsis.Bioweapons Expert Speaks Out About Novel Coronavirus\n",

      "Sponsored by RevcontentTrending Now. The China Coronavirus 5G Connection is a very important factor when trying to comprehend the coronavirus (formerly abbreviated 2019-nCoV, now COVID-19) outbreak. Various independent researchers around the web, for around 2-3 weeks now, have highlighted the coronavirus-5G link despite the fact that Google (as the self-appointed NWO Censor-in-Chief) is doing its best to hide and scrub all search results showing the connection. The coronavirus 5G connection doesn’t mean the bioweapons connection is false (it’s not a case of either-or), but rather broadens the scope of the entire event. Wuhan was one of the test cities chosen for China 5G rollout; 5G went live there on October 31st, 2019, almost exactly 2 months before the coronavirus outbreak began. Meanwhile, many scientific documents on the health effects of 5G have verified that it causes flu-like symptoms. This article reveals the various connections behind the coronavirus phenomenon, including how 5G can exacerbate or cause the kind of illness you are attributing to the new virus. The rabbit hole is deep so let’s take a dive. 5G – A Type Of Directed Energy Weapon\n",
      "For the deeper background to 5G, read my 2017 article 5G and IoT: Total Technological Control Grid Being Rolled Out Fast. Many people around the world, including concerned citizens, scientist and even governmental officials, are becoming aware of the danger of 5G. This is why it has already been banned in many places worldwide, such as Brussels, the Netherlands and parts of Switzerland, Ireland, Italy, Germany, the UK, the USA and Australia. After all, 5G is not just the next generation of mobile connectivity after 4G; it is a radical and entirely new type of technology – a military technology used on the battlefield that is now being ‘deployed’ (military term) in the civilian realm. It is phased array weaponry being sold and disguised as primarily a communications system when the frequency bands it uses (24GHz – 100+GHz including MMW [millimeter waves]) are the very same ones used in Active Denial Systems, i.e. crowd control. Even mainstream Wikipedia describes Active Denial Systems as directed energy weaponry; it disperses crowds by firing energy at them, causing immediate and intense pain, including a sensation of the skin burning. Remember, directed energy weapons (DEW) are behind the fall of the Twin Towers on 9/11 and the fake Californian ‘wildfires’. Numerous scientists have warned of the dangerous health effects of 5G. For instance, in this 5G Appeal from 2017 entitled Scientists and Doctors Warn of Potential Serious Health Effects of 5G, scientists warned of the harmful of non-ionizing RF/EMF radiation: “Effects include increased cancer risk, cellular stress, increase in harmful free radicals, genetic damages, structural and functional changes of the reproductive system, learning and memory deficits, neurological disorders, and negative impacts on general wellbeing in humans. Damage goes well beyond the human race, as there is growing evidence of harmful effects to both plants and animals.” If you listen to Mark Steele and Barrie Trower, you’ll get an idea of the horrifying effects of 5G. In this interview, Trower echoes the above quote by stating how 5G damages the immune system of trees and kills insects. He reveals how in 1977, 5G was tested on animals in hopes of finding a weapon. The results were severe demyelination – stripping the protective sheath of nerve cells. Some nations are now noticing a 90% loss of insects (including pollinating insects like bees) which congregate around lamp-posts where 5G is installed. Wuhan Military Games And Event 201 Simulation If you dig deep enough, some disturbing connections arise between 5G and the men who have developed or are developing vaccines for novel viruses like ebola, zika and the new coronavirus COVID-19. In a fantastic piece of research, an author under the pen name of Annie Logical wrote the article Corona Virus Fakery And The Link To 5G Testing that lays out the coronavirus 5G connection. There is a ton of information, so I will break it all down to make it more understandable. From October 18-27th 2019, Wuhan hosted the Military World Games and specifically used 5G (for the first time ever) for the event. Also on October 18th, 2019 in New York, the Johns Hopkins Center in partnership with World Economic Forum (WEF) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation hosted Event 201 – “A Global Pandemic Exercise” which is a simulation of a pandemic.Guess what virus they happen to choose for their ‘simulation’? A coronavirus! Guess what animal cells they use? Pig cells! (COVID-19 was initially reported to be derived from a seafood market, and the fish there are known to be fed on pig waste). Event 201 includes the UN (since the WEF now has a partnership agreement with UN), Big Pharma (Johnson and Johnson), Bill Gates (key figure in pushing vaccines, human microchipping and Agenda 2030) and both China and America’s CDC. Participants in Event 201 recommended that governments force social media companies to stop the spread of ‘fake news’ and that ultimately the only way to control the information would be for the WHO (World Health Organization, part of the UN) to be the sole central purveyor of information during a pandemic. Inovio, Electroporation And 5G As reported on January 24th, 2020, US biotech and pharmaceutical company Inovio received a $9 million grant to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus. Inovio got the money grant from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), however they already have an existing partnership with CEPI; in April 2018 they got up to $56 million to develop vaccines for Lassa Fever and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). CEPI was founded in Davos by the governments of Norway and India, the Wellcome Trust … and the participants of Event 201: the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the WEF. CEPI’s CEO is the former director of BARDA (US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority) which is part of the HHS. Inovio claimed they developed a coronavirus vaccine in 2 hours! On the face of it such a claim is absurd; what is more likely is that they are lying or that they already had the vaccine because they had the foreknowledge that the coronavirus was coming and was about to be unleashed. So who owns and runs Inovio? Two key men are David Weiner and Dr. Joseph Kim. Weiner was once Kim’s university professor. Weiner was involved with developing a vaccine for HIV and zika (you can read my articles about zika here and here where I exposed some of the lies surrounding that epidemic). Kim was funded by Merck (a large Big Pharma company) and produced something called Porcine Circovirus (PCV 1 and PCV 2). As mentioned above, there is a link between pig vaccines/pig DNA and the coronavirus; Annie Logical notes that it “has long been established that seafood in the area is fed on pig waste.” Kim served a 5-year tenure as a member of the WEF’s Global Agenda Council – yet another organ pushing the New World Order One World Government under the banner of Agenda 2030 Global Governance. Weiner is an employee and advisor to the FDA, is considered a DNA technology expert and pioneered a new DNA transference method called electroporation – a microbiology technique which uses an electrical pulse to create temporary pores in cell membranes through which substances like chemicals, drugs or DNA can be introduced into the cell. This technique can be used to administer DNA vaccines, which inject foreign DNA into a host’s cells that changes the host’s DNA. This means if you take a DNA vaccine, you are allowing your DNA to be changed! As if vaccines weren’t already horrific enough … but here’s the kicker: electroporation uses pulsed waves. Guess what else uses pulsed waves? 5G! This is either a startling coincidence or evidence or a sinister coronavirus 5G-connection. Annie writes:“. he same action that 5G technology uses in pulsed waves and the coronavirus was reported to have started in an area in China that had rolled out 5G technology! “So we can see how geneticists using scientists are tampering with the building blocks of our existence and what is disturbing is that Prof Wiener is a HIV pioneer and we know that soon after the Polio vaccines were given to millions in Africa that HIV emerged. They have perfected the art of injecting animal or bird DNA into human chromosomes which alters our DNA and causes things like haemorrhaging, fever, cancers and even death.”Speaking of HIV (which is not the same things as AIDS, but that is another story), remember also that a group of Indian scientists put out their research that the virus was manmade and had HIV inserts. They found that 4 separate HIV genes were randomly embedded within the coronavirus. These genes somehow converged to create receptor sites on the virus that were identical to HIV, which was a surprise due to their random placement. They also specifically stated that this was not likely to happen naturally (“unlikely to be fortuitous in nature”). In yet another example of egregious censorship, these scientists were pressured to withdraw their work. 5G And Electroporation DNA Vaccines – Both Producing Pulsed EMF Waves Consider the implications of this for a moment. The technology exists to use EMFs to open your very skin pores and inject foreign DNA into your bloodstream and cells. This is an extreme violation of your bodily sovereignty, and it can have long-term effects, because of genetic mutation – changing your very DNA which is the biological blueprint and physical essence of who you are. What if 5G mimics electroporation? What if 5G can do on a large scale what electroporation does on a small scale? We already know that 5G has the potential to be mutagenic (DNA-damaging). The frequencies that 5G uses, especially 75-100GHz, interact with the geometrical structure of our skin and sweat ducts, acting upon them like a transmission reaching an antenna, and fundamentally affecting us and our mood. What if 5G is being used to open up the skin of those in Wuhan so as to allow the new bioweapon coronavirus to infiltrate more easily? Mandatory Vaccines, Depopulation And Transhumanism So, what’s at the bottom of the coronavirus-5G connection rabbit hole? I would suggest we find mandatory vaccine agenda, the depopulation agenda and transhumanist agenda (via DNA vaccines). The key figures and groups who appear to have planned this already have the vaccine in place, just as they did for the other epidemics that fizzled out (SARS, ebola and zika). Weiner even has links to HIV/AIDS, and if you dive into that as Jon Rappoport did, you find gaping holes in that story. It’s the same epidemic / pandemic game played out every 2-3 years. There’s a couple of versions. In the first version, you invent a virus, hype it up, get people scared, do ineffectual and inconclusive tests (e.g. like the PCR test which measures if a viral fragment is present but doesn’t tell you the quantities of whether it would actually causing the disease), inflate the body count, justify quarantine/martial law and brainwash people into thinking they have to buy the (toxic) vaccine and introduce mandatory vaccination. You don’t even need a real virus or pathogen for the version. In the second version, you create a virus as a bioweapon, release it as a test, pretend it was a natural mutation, watch how many people it kills (which helps with the eugenics and depopulation agendas), again justify martial law, again justify the need for mandatory vaccines and even pose as the savior with the vaccine that stops it. As a variation on this second version, you can even develop a race-specific bioweapon so as to reduce the population of rival nations or enemy races as a geopolitical strategy. This article suggests that the coronavirus targets Chinese people / Asians more than others, and certainly the official death count attests to that, although it’s always hard to trust governmental statistics. Annie Logical gives her take: “The con job goes like this. Step 1) poison the population purposely to create disease that does not and would never occur naturally Step 2) parlay the purposely created disease as being caused by something invisible, outside the realm of control or knowledge of the average person Step 3) create a toxic vaccine or medication that was always intended to further poison the population into an early grave Step 4) parlay the vaccine or medication poisoning as PROOF the disease, which never existed, is much worse than anticipated Step 5) increase the initial poisoning, which is marketed as a fake disease, and also increase the vaccine and medication poisoning, to start piling the bodies into the stratosphere Step 6) repeat as many times as possible upon an uninformed population because killing a population this way (the art of having people line up to kill themselves with poison……known as a “soft kill” method) is the only legal way to make sure such eugenic operations can be executed on mass and in plain sight.“ DNA vaccines are a disturbing new advancement for transhumanism. After all, the objective of the transhumanist agenda is to merge man with machine, and in doing so, wipe out what fundamentally makes us human, so we can be controlled and overtaken by a deeply sinister and negative force. It’s all about changing us at the fundamental level, or attacking human sovereignty itself. DNA vaccines fit right in with that – literally changing your DNA by forcefully inserting foreign DNA to change your genetics, with consequences no one could possibly fully foresee and predict. One Last Coronavirus – 5G Connection Finally, I will finish with another coronavirus-5G connection. The word coronavirus itself refers to many kinds of viruses by that name, not just COVID-19. Guess who owns a patent for a coronavirus strain that can be used to develop a vaccine? The Pirbright Institute. And guess who partially owns them? Bill Gates! As you can read here Pirbright is being supported in their vaccine developement endeavors by a British company Innovate UK … who also funds and supports the rollout of 5G. Innovate UK ran a competition in 2018 with a £15 million share out to any small business that could produce vaccines for ‘epidemic’ potential.The Motivation To Hype And The Motivation To Downplay History has shown that in cases of epidemics (or fake epidemics) there is almost always a morass of conflicting reports and contradictory information. In such situations, it can be very difficult to get to the bottom of the matter and find the truth. The conflict stems from the different motivations of nations, governments and other interested groups. Essentially, there are 2 main motivations: the motivation to hype (exaggerate and use fear to grab attention, sell something, make a group look bad/incompetent, make people scared, make the public accept mandatory vaccination and martial law) and the motivation to downplay (cover up and hide the true extent of the damage, morbidity or mortality so as to appear competent and in control, to lessen possible anger, backlash or disorder). Sometimes, these 2 motivations may drive the behavior of the same group, e.g. in the case of the Chinese Government, it has the motivation to hype (to get people afraid so they easily follow its draconian quarantine rules) and the motivation to downplay (so as to appear in the eyes of its people and the rest of the entire world to have the situation under control, to ensure saving face, credibility and a good reputation). Final Thoughts On The Coronavirus 5G Connection. Governments around the world have experimented with bioweapons both on their own citizens and foreign citizens, and even sold that research to other governments for their own benefit (e.g. Japan’s notorious Unit 731 which developed bioweapons in China, only to hand over that research to the US after losing World War 2). See Bioweapons: Lyme Disease, Weaponized Ticks, Plum Island & More for a brief history of the USG’s usage of weaponized ticks which resulted in Lyme Disease. The evidence that COVID-19 is a bioweapon is overwhelming – and so is the evidence that 5G is involved to either cause the flu-like symptoms/pneumonia people have been experiencing, and/or to exacerbate the virulity of the virus by weakening people’s immune systems and subjecting them to pulsed waves of EMF to open up their skin to foreign DNA fragments (including viruses). In this kinds of story, there are no major coincidences – only connections and conspiracies waiting to be uncovered.

      "The hype and disinformation campaign about the spread of the new COVID-19 coronavirus has created a climate of fear and uncertainty around the world since WHO declared it a medical emergency. international public health on January 30. The fear campaign is underway, creating panic and uncertainty. National governments and WHO mislead the public.\"About 84000 people in at least 56 countries have been infected and about 2900 have died,\" said the New York Times. What the newspaper fails to mention is that 98% of infections are in mainland China. There are fewer than 5000 confirmed cases outside of China (WHO, February 28, 2020). At the moment, there is no real pandemic outside of mainland China. The numbers speak for themselves. At the time of this writing, the number of \"confirmed cases\" in the US is 64 .The number is minimal, but the media is spreading panic.There are however 15 million cases of influenza in the USA .The latest FluView surveillance report from the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicates that on January 18, 2020, there were 15 million influenza cases, 140000 hospitalizations and 8200 deaths in this influenza season in the USA (emphasis added ). COVID-19 Pandemic Data On February 28, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 83652 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 78961 in mainland China. Outside China, there were 4691 (WHO, February 28, 2020, see table on the right). WHO also reported 2791 deaths, including only 67 outside of mainland China .These figures confirm that the pandemic is mainly confined to mainland China. In addition, recent data tend to show that the epidemic in China is under control. On February 21, 2020, the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China reported that 36157 patients were declared cured and discharged from hospital (see chart below).Chinese reports confirm that people have received treatment and are recovering from the viral infection. The number of infected patients is also decreasing. According to the National Pharmaceutical Administration of China, hospitals use the antiviral drug Favilavir \"to treat coronavirus with minimal side effects\".Let's look at the numbers:The world population is around 7.8 billion people.The population of China is around 1.4 billion people.The world population minus China is around 6.4 billion people.4691 confirmed cases and 67 reported deaths (outside of China) out of a population of 6.4 billion do not constitute a pandemic. 4691 / 6400000000 = 0.00000073 = 0.000073%. In the USA, 64 cases out of a population of around 330 million do not constitute a pandemic. (data from February 28): 64 / 330000000 .Why propaganda? Racism against people of Chinese origin. A deliberate campaign against China has been launched and a wave of racist sentiments against people of Chinese origin is underway, largely peddled by the Western media.The Economist  reports that \"The coronavirus spreads racism against people of Chinese origin and also among themselves.\"Fear of covid-19 causes people to behave badly, including some Chinese.\"The Chinese community in Great Britain is facing racism because of the coronavirus epidemic\" according to the SCMP.“Chinese communities abroad are increasingly facing racist abuse and discrimination in the context of the coronavirus epidemic. Some people of Chinese origin living in the UK say they have been the victims of growing hostility due to the deadly virus from China.The New York Times reported on March 30 that President Trump backed down from his previous statement that by April 12, the COVID-19 lockout should be over and it's time to think about \" back to work \". Instead, he said an extension until the end of April was necessary - and perhaps even until June. This, he said, followed the advice of his advisers, including Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), within the National Institute for Health (NIH), The COVID-19 virus has so far caused far fewer infections and deaths than regular flu in recent years. The WHO reported on March 30, 750000 infections worldwide and 36000 deaths. In the United States, there are approximately 161000 cases and 3000 deaths. Yet whistleblower Fauci says there could be millions of cases of coronavirus in the United States and 100000 to 200000 deaths. And, coincidentally, Bill Gates does the same, using roughly the same numbers.\n",
      "All this with the idea of ​​imposing a vaccine on the population.A multi-billion dollar vaccine is not necessary.NIAD and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation are collaborating to develop a COVID-19 vaccine.China has shown that the COVID-19 virus can be brought under control at relatively low cost and with strict discipline and traditional medicines. The same drugs and measures have been used for centuries to successfully prevent and cure all kinds of viral diseases.First of all, a vaccine against COVID-19, or against coronaviruses in general, is a vaccine against influenza. Vaccines do not cure. Ideally, influenza vaccines can prevent the virus from affecting a patient as much as it would without a vaccine. The effectiveness of influenza vaccines is generally evaluated between 20 and 50%. Above all, vaccines are a huge financial bonus for large pharmaceutical companies.Then here are a multitude of remedies that have proven to be very effective. See also this and that.The French Professor Didier Raoult , which is one of the five best scientists in the world in the field of communicable diseases, has suggested the use of hydroxychloroquine ( Chloroquine or Plaquenil) , a well known drug, simple and low COVID-19: More Hydroxychloroquine Data From Francecost, also used to fight malaria, which has been shown to work with previous coronaviruses such as SARS. From mid-February 2020, clinical trials at his institute and in China have already confirmed that the drug can reduce viral load and bring a dramatic improvement. Chinese scientists have published their first trials on more than 100 patients and announced that the Chinese National Health Commission would recommend chloroquine in its new guidelines for the treatment of the COVID-19 virus.China and Cuba are collaborating on the use of interferon Alpha 2B, a highly effective antiviral drug developed in Cuba for 39 years, but little known to the world, due to the embargo imposed by the United States on everything which comes from Cuba. Interferon has also been shown to be very effective in the fight against COVID-19 and is now produced in a joint venture in China. There is an old natural Indian / Ayurvedic medicine, curcumin, which comes in the form of C90 capsules. It is an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compound that has been used successfully to treat cancer, infectious diseases and, yes, coronaviruses.\n",
      "Other simple but effective remedies include the use of large doses of vitamin C , as well as vitamin D3 , or more generally the use of essential micro-nutrients to fight infections, especially vitamins A, B, C, D summer. Another remedy used for thousands of years by the ancient Chinese, Romans and Egyptians is colloidal silver products. They come in the form of a liquid to be administered orally, or to be injected, or to be applied to the skin. Colloidal silver products strengthen the immune system, fight bacteria and viruses, and have been used to treat cancer, HIV / AIDS, shingles, herpes, eye conditions, prostatitis - and COVID-19.\n",
      "A simple and inexpensive remedy to use in combination with others is the menthol-based \"Mentholatum  \" . It is used for common flu and cold symptoms. Applied on and around the nose, it acts as a disinfectant and prevents germs from entering the respiratory tract, including coronaviruses.Northern Italy and New Orleans report that an unusual number of patients had China Is Using Cuba's Interferon Alfa 2B Against Coronavirus ...to be hospitalized in intensive care units (ICUs) and placed on a 24-hour, 7-day-a-day ventilator %, some of them not reacting and falling into respiratory failure. The reported mortality rate is around 40%. This condition is called acute respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS. This means that the lungs are filled with fluid. When this description of ARDS episodes applies, Dr. Raoult and other medical colleagues recommend COVID-19 patients to \"sleep sit\" until they are cured. This allows the fluid to escape from the lungs. This method has been known for its effectiveness since it was first documented during the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic.Finally, Chinese researchers, in cooperation with Cuban and Russian scientists, are also developing a vaccine that may soon be ready for testing. This vaccine would attempt to attack not only a single strand of coronavirus, but also the basic genome of coronaviral RNA (RNA = ribonucleic acid), to prevent new mutations in coronaviruses. Unlike the West, which works exclusively for profit, the Sino-Cuban-Russian vaccine would be made available to the whole world at a low price.These alternative remedies cannot be found on the internet controlled by the major pharmaceutical companies. Internet references, if any, may discourage their use. At best, they will tell you that these products or methods have not proven to be effective, and at worst, that they can be harmful. Don't believe it. None of these products or methods are harmful. Remember that some of them have been used as natural remedies for thousands of years. And don't forget that China has successfully mastered COVID-19, using some of these relatively simple and inexpensive drugs.Few doctors know these practical, simple and inexpensive remedies. The media, under pressure from giants of the pharmaceutical industry and government agencies that comply with it, were asked to censor this valuable information. Neglect or inability to publicize these readily available remedies takes their toll.The role of Bill Gates and locking. Bill Gates may have been one of Trump's \"advisers\", suggesting that he extend the \"return to work\" date at least until the end of April, and, if Gates wants it, at least until in June. It remains to be seen. Gates is very - very powerful:Bill Gates Says US Has Missed Chance to Avoid Coronavirus Closure and Businesses Should Stay Closed. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation will be the source of the organization of mass vaccination which should be launched in the period following containment.The vaccination association includes the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations ( CEPI ), a semi-NGO, to which NIH / NIAID has entrusted the supervision of the vaccination program - with the support of Bill Gates; GAVI, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization - also a creation of Bill Gates, supported by WHO, also heavily funded by the Gates Foundation; the World Bank and UNICEF; as well as a myriad of pharmaceutical partners.Bill Gates also strongly suggests that travelers must have a vaccination certificate in their passports before boarding a plane or entering a country.The implementation of the program, including a related global electronic identity program, possibly administered using nanos chips that could be integrated into the vaccine itself, would be overseen by the little-known agency Agenda ID2020, which is also an initiative from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.Bill Gates is also known as a fervent proponent of a drastic and selective reduction of the population. Knowing what we know, who would trust any vaccine with the signature of Bill Gates. The hope that this evil enterprise will not succeed is very important. Economic war against China. The US strategy is to use COVID-19 to isolate China, despite the fact that the US economy relies heavily on Chinese imports.The short-term disorganization of the Chinese economy is largely due to the (temporary) closure of trade and transportation circuits.The public health emergency declared by the WHO is combined with media misinformation and a ban on flights to China. Panic on Wall Street. Media disinformation has taken on another dimension by causing panic on the stock markets. Fear of the coronavirus has led to a fall in financial markets around the world. According to reports, the value of the world's stock markets has plummeted by around $ 6 trillion. This decline has so far been on the order of \"15% or more\".This causes massive losses in personal savings (ie, average Americans), to which are added personal bankruptcies and corporate bankruptcies.It is also a boon for institutional speculators, especially for corporate hedge funds. The financial meltdown leads to large transfers of monetary wealth in the pockets of a handful of financial institutions.The most ironic is that analysts casually link the collapse of the markets to the spread of the virus, when there are only 64 confirmed cases in the USA.\"No wonder the markets are going down ... the virus has grown so much ...\"Could we \"predict\" the financial crash of February? It would be naive to believe that the financial crisis was only due to market forces that responded spontaneously to the spread of COVID-19. The market was already carefully manipulated by powerful players who use speculative instruments in the derivatives markets, including \"short selling\". The unspoken objective is the concentration of wealth. It was quite a financial boon for the \"insiders\" who knew in advance what would lead to WHO's decision to declare a public health emergency of international concern on January 30.Was the COVID-19 (nCoV-2019) pandemic known in advance? What are the likely repercussions?On October 18, 2019, the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Baltimore undertook a carefully crafted simulation exercise of a coronavirus outbreak called nCoV-2019. In the exercise called Event 201 Simulation of a Coronavirus Pandemic , we “simulated” a stock market fall of 15%. It was not \"planned\" according to event organizers and sponsors, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the World Economic Forum.The simulation carried out in October called nCoV-2019 took place barely two months before the appearance of COVID-19. John Hopkins' pandemic simulation simulated a stock market drop of \"  15% or more  \" (video, section 0.0 - 1'2 ″), which largely corresponds to the drop that really took place at the end of February 2020. Many aspects of this \"simulation exercise\" actually correspond to what actually happened when the Director-General of WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020. What needs to be understood is that those who sponsored the John Hopkins Center “simulation exercise” are powerful and knowledgeable in the areas of “global health” (B. and M. Gates Foundation) and \"The world economy\" (GEF).It should also be noted that WHO initially adopted a similar acronym (to denote the coronavirus) to that of the John Hopkins Center Pandemic Simulation Exercise ( nCoV-2019 ) before changing it to COVID-19. Corruption and the role of WHO.What motivated the WHO Director General, Dr.  Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , to declare that the Ncov-2019 is a \"public health emergency of international concern\" on 30 January, when the epidemic was largely confined to mainland China?Everything suggests that the Director General of WHO Tedros served the interests of powerful corporate partners.According to F. William Engdahl , Tedros has long-standing ties to the Clintons and the Clinton Foundation. He is also closely linked to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Along with the World Economic Forum in Davos, the Gates Foundation sponsored the John Hopkins nCoV-2019 “simulation exercise”.As Minister of Health, Tedros also chaired the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, of which the Gates Foundation was the co-founder. The Global Fund has been marred by fraud and corruption scandals. \"During the three-year campaign by Tedros to get his post at WHO, he was accused of hiding three major cholera epidemics while he was Ethiopia's Minister of Health, falsely qualifying the cases \"acute watery diarrhea\" (a symptom of cholera), to minimize the scale of the epidemic, an accusation he denied. (Engdahl, op. Cit.).A massive vaccine development campaign has been ordered by WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Many pharmaceutical companies are already working on it.In this regard, it is important to recall the fraud of the WHO during the mandate of its predecessor, Dr Margaret Chan , who said this about the H1N1 swine flu pandemic in 2009: Vaccine manufacturers can produce 4.9 billion influenza vaccines a year at best. ( Margaret Chan, executive director of the World Health Organization , cited by Reuters on July 21, 2009, underline added).There was no H1N1 pandemic in 2009. It was a fraud to make money, as revealed by the European Parliament. What is the next step in the COVID-19 pandemic? Is it a fake or a true pandemic?The propaganda against China is not over.Nor is the \"fear pandemic\" outside of China, despite the really low number of \"confirmed cases\".The financial crisis continues, supported by media disinformation and financial interference.If normal business relationships (and transportation) between the US and China are not restored, the delivery of \"Made in China\" consumer goods exported to the United States will be jeopardized.This situation could trigger a major crisis in the retail trade in the USA, where “Made in China” goods constitute a significant part of monthly household consumption. From a public health perspective, the prospects for eliminating COVID-19 in China are favorable. Progress has already been reported. In the rest of the world (where there were approximately 3000 confirmed cases on February 28, 2020), the COVID-19 pandemic continues, along with propaganda for a global vaccination program.Without a fear campaign combined with fake news, COVID-19 would not have made headlines.From a medical point of view, is global vaccination indicated?. 43.3% of \"confirmed cases\" in China are now considered \"recovered\" (see graph above). Western reports do not distinguish between \"confirmed cases\" and \"confirmed infected cases\". It is the latter cases that are relevant. The trend is towards a recovery and a decrease in \"confirmed infected cases\".\n",
      "The WHO massive vaccination campaign (mentioned above) was duly confirmed by its Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , on February 28:\n",
      "“… More than 20 vaccines are being developed worldwide and several therapeutic products are undergoing clinical trials, the first results of which are expected in“ a few weeks ”. (emphasis added). It goes without saying that this WHO decision constitutes another financial windfall for the five main vaccine producers: GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, Merck & Co., Sanofi, and Pfizer, which control 85% of the vaccine market. According to CNBC:  (emphasis added). These companies have entered the race to fight the deadly coronavirus and are working on programs to create vaccines or drugs ... Sanofi is teaming up with the US government to develop a vaccine against the new virus , hoping that its work on the the 2003 SARS outbreak will speed up the process. In 2019, Merck earned $ 8.4 billion in revenues from the vaccine market, a growing segment at an annual rate of 9% since 2010, according to Bernstein.GlaxoSmithKline announced this month its partnership with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations [CEPI] for a vaccination program ... CEPI was launched at the 2017 World Economic Forum.Interestingly, CEPI launched in Davos in 2017 is supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Wellcome Trust (a multi-billion dollar British humanitarian foundation) and the World Economic Forum. The governments of Norway and India are members and their role is mainly to finance CEPI.Chronology. October 18, 2019  : The B. and M. Gates Foundation and the World Economic Forum are partners in the pandemic “simulation exercise” at nCoV-2019 conducted by the John Hopkins Center for Health Security in October 2019.December 31, 2019  : China alerts the WHO to the discovery of several cases of \"unusual pneumonia\" in Wuhan, Hubei province.January 7, 2020  : Chinese officials say they have identified a new virus. WHO names the new virus 2019-nCoV ( exactly the same name as the virus which was the object of the simulation exercise of the John Hopkins Center, except the placement of the date).January 24-25, 2020  : Davos Summit under the auspices of CEPI, which is also the fruit of a partnership between the World Economic Forum and the Gates Foundation, during which the development of a vaccine against the 2019 nCoV is announced (2 weeks after the announcement of January 7, 2020 and barely a week before the declaration of a public health emergency of international scope by the WHO). January 30, 2020  : The WHO director declares a \"public health emergency of international concern\". Now a vaccination campaign has been launched to stop COVID-19 under the auspices of CEPI in partnership with GlaxoSmithKline. Conclusion. COVID-19 (aka nCoV-2019) represents a treasure worth billions of dollars for large pharmaceutical companies. But it also contributes to precipitating humanity into a dangerous process of economic, social and geopolitical destabilization.COVID-19 Coronavirus: A False Pandemic? Who is behind this?

      "Two days ago, a paper published in the Biorxiv.org journal presented findings that indicated the coronavirus appeared to be engineered with “key structural proteins” of HIV. The paper, entitled, “Uncanny similarity of unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV spike protein to HIV-1 gp120 and Gag,” concluded that the engineering of coronavirus with such gene sequences was “unlikely to be fortuitous in nature,” providing strong scientific support for the theory that the coronavirus is an engineered bioweapon that escaped laboratory containment in China.The coverage of this paper by Zero Hedge led to a firestorm of denials by governments, health authorities and the CIA-controlled media, not surprisingly. Any suggestion that the coronavirus was engineered as a bioweapon had to be immediately eliminated. The prevailing panic by the establishment sought to blame this outbreak on Mother Nature — i.e. bats, snakes, seafood, etc. — rather than the human beings who are playing around with deadly biological weapons that are designed to extinguish human life.Within hours, Twitter slapped down a permanent ban on Zero Hedge, making sure the independent publisher could no longer reach its Twitter audience. After all, the first casualty in any pandemic is the truth, and Jack Dorsey is not only an enabler of pedophiles and child rapists, he’s also an authoritarian tyrant who wants to make sure the public is completely isolated from any “non official” reports about this pandemic. (Jack Dorsey has sided with communist China, in other words. Is anyone surprised?). Under the intense pressure, the authors of the original paper have now withdrawn the paper and intend to revise it. The publication that originally carried the paper now has a warning message stating, “This article has been withdrawn. Click here for details.” (See original source link here.)\n",
      "In addition, the publisher has posted a message warning that all the science papers it posts as “preliminary reports” that “should not be regarded as conclusive,” especially when the science establishment is panicked that its official narratives might be crumbling by the hour.No doubt the authors of this particular paper have been sufficiently threatened to revise their conclusions, and an update of their original paper will soon be posted that effectively denounces everything they stated in the original paper. The criminal wing of the science establishment strikes again, of course, and this tactic of threatening scientists with loss of funding, being blacklisted or even physically threatened and killed is not unusual at all. The CDC, NIH and even the EPA have long histories of threatening scientists with being harmed or killed if they don’t fall in line with the prevailing lies of the establishment. In some cases, they’ve even imprisoned scientists for fraud after those individuals refused to retract their papers. This has been especially common in research areas such as HIV / AIDS, pandemics and vaccines. Any scientist who finds fault with the establishment is destroyed, imprisoned or murdered.In fact, I’ve interviewed one of the science victims of this, named Judy Mikovits, PhD. Watch my full interview here, but keep reading below first, because there’s a lot more to this story that will shock you:pShuttle-SN sequence proves the coronavirus pandemic was definitely engineered in a lab. Now, stunning new evidence has emerged that proves the coronavirus was definitely engineered in a laboratory and may have been deliberately injected into patients as part of a Chinese vaccine experiment gone wrong.As detailed by James Lyons-Weiler, PhD, founder of the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge and author of 57 peer-reviewed publications, an analysis of the gene sequence for the coronavirus finds a peculiar sequence called “pShuttle-SN.” This sequence is is the remnant of a genetic engineering sequence that’s used to insert genes into viruses and bacteria. It provides irrefutable “open source” proof that the coronavirus now circulating in the wild was engineered in a laboratory. Every lab that has the gene sequence can see this for themselves. It’s right out in the open, which is why we describe this revelation as “open source.”\n",
      "“One thing we can say for certain is that this particular virus has a laboratory origin,” states Lyons-Weiler in a bombshell interview with Del Bigtree of The Highwire (see video below, via Brighteon.com, since the video would be banned everywhere else).This genomic evidence does not, however, prove whether it was produced as a bioweapon or as a vaccine experiment. It could be either one, according to Lyons-Weiler:In fact, if you then take that sequence and compare it to other proteins, we find that it’s actually a SARS protein that was put into a coronavirus for the purpose of making the vaccine work better. That’s why this element is in there, to create a more reactogenic vaccine.There’s bombshell after bombshell in this interview, especially at the 27:59 and 33:57 marks. Watch it exclusively at Brighteon.com, given that this information is of course being banned everywhere else by the anti-human tech giants, all of which are now siding with communist China to cover up the truth:If it was a vaccine experiment gone wrong, then the world is in real trouble, warns analyst.Why does it matter whether the origin was a Chinese vaccine experiment vs. a bioweapon? As previous research has revealed, when these SARS insertions into the coronavirus are introduced into animal as part of a vaccine, they create heightened fatalities when patients are exposed to other coronavirus strains.\n",
      "In effect, being vaccinated with this particular strain of coronavirus causes individuals to be more easily killed by the common cold and other non-pandemic coronavirus strains that are circulating in the wild.This is confirmed in the following science paper published in the PLoS ONE science journal: Immunization with SARS Coronavirus Vaccines Leads to Pulmonary Immunopathology on Challenge with the SARS Virus.This horrifying realization emerged when Chinese researchers were trying to make a SARS vaccine following the SARS outbreak from several years ago. They discovered that the SARS vaccine increased fatalities instead of saving people. Further study revealed that the SARS sequence being inserted into the coronavirus made the virus far more deadly, effectively transforming it into a bioweapon whether intended or not.\n",
      "Now, James Lyons-Weiler, PhD, has published a detailed article explaining the SARS insertion into the coronavirus and why this is proof that the coronavirus now circulating in the wild is of laboratory origin, not coming from bats and snakes. From his interview, above:Was it a vaccine that the Chinese government was experimenting with? … If you use a SARS vaccine in ferrets, rats or monkeys, and then they get a secondary infection of a SARS virus, the elderly and immunocompromised end up dying.So what we may in fact be looking at is a hidden attempt by the Chinese to get a jump on this, the economics of vaccines… it’s not working no matter who develops the vaccine, and that’s why the last time there was a SARS vaccine, the vaccine developers could not get funding because the mice, the rats were dying.\n",
      "I can say with certainty it’s not just a wild type coronavirus that just happened to acquire this [SARS] element. It’s laboratory acquired somehow. It has escaped from the laboratory or people have been vaccinated with it and that’s why it’s in their bodies…There’s a huge difference in the predicted health outcome for the world if this is a vaccination experiment in China versus just a laboratory escaped vaccine. In the vaccination experiment, you’re not vaccinated against coronavirus with that vaccine…, so if the Chinese tried to get a jump on the vaccine market by surreptitiously running clinical trials. against the coronavirus, and made their elderly and immunocompromised more susceptible to death due to subsequent infection by any coronavirus with this protein that’s in the vaccine, then the rest of the world has a serious humanitarian issue. if it is a biological laboratory weapons escape, it’s going to be a nightmare, but if it’s a vaccine type that escaped because of an accidental injection into someone, it’s going to be worse than… if they made their entire population susceptible to SARS with a vaccine program.In other words, if it’s an escaped vaccine strain that has now gone wild, the entire world is now vulnerable to the SARS-coronavirus gene insertion which was previously found to be killing lab animals, which is why the SARS vaccine program was halted (because it was too dangerous to test on humans).As Lyons-Weiler writes, “IPAK researchers found a sequence similarity between a pShuttle-SN recombination vector sequence and INS1378. Here’s a shot of the alignment and the DOT Plot.”The process for achieving this was patented by Chinese researchers as shown in this patent link.Lyons-Weiler warns:The disease progression in of 2019-nCoV is consistent with those seen in animals and humans vaccinated against SARS and then challenged with re-infection. Thus, the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV is an experimental vaccine type must be seriously considered.He further concludes that this appears almost certain to be a vaccine experiment gone wrong:The available evidence most strongly supports that the 2019-NCoV virus is a vaccine strain of coronavirus either accidentally released from a laboratory accident, perhaps a laboratory researcher becoming infected with the virus while conducting animal experiments, or the Chinese were performing clinical studies of a Coronavirus vaccine in humans.If this is further confirmed, we may, in fact, be looking at a true vaccine holocaust where vaccine researchers are now subjecting the entire world to a deadly mistake that could theoretically cause a very large number of fatalities… all in the quest for vaccine profits, of course.As Lyons-Weiler further warns:If the Chinese government has been conducting human trials against SARS. MERS, or other coronviruses using recombined viruses, they may have made their citizens far more susceptible to acute respiratory distress syndrome upon infection with 2019-nCoV coronavirus.The implications are clear: if China sensitized their population via a SARS vaccine, and this escaped from a lab, the rest of world has a serious humanitarian urgency to help China, but may not expect as serious an epidemic as might otherwise be expected.In the worst-case scenario, if the vaccination strain is more highly contagious and lethal, 2019-nCoV could become the worst example of vaccine-derived contagious disease in human history.Tech giants now working over time to cover it all up, censor all dissenting views, and reinforce communist China’s official lies. As expected, the evil tech giants are working overtime to squelch any dissenting views and protect the vaccine industry as well as the bioweapons industry. No blame can be allowed to fall on either one. Instead, Mother Nature must be blamed for all this. And that means the truth must be silenced… a strategy that is, of course, routine for the vaccine industry.Every channel, voice or website now exploring any human origins of this coronavirus strain — whether related to vaccines or bioweapons — is being rapidly de-platformed and attacked. In some cases, websites are being sabotaged and taken offline, as happened with Natural News last week (we have since recovered, which is why you are able to read this).Yet the anti-human tech giants are unified in their efforts to silence all information that contradicts official lies, no matter how scientifically accurate that information may be.Watch this important video to learn more about Big Tech and how it ran a simulation — complete with fake news censorship highlights — to play out the exact scenario we’re all witnessing now: A global pandemic of human origin, infecting tens of thousands of people, accompanied by a government cover-up:New evidence emerges: Coronavirus “bioweapon” might have been a Chinese vaccine experiment gone wrong… genes contain “pShuttle-SN” sequences, proving laboratory origin\n",

      "The China Coronavirus 5G Connection is a very important factor when trying to comprehend the coronavirus (formerly abbreviated 2019-nCoV, now COVID-19) outbreak. Various independent researchers around the web, for around 2-3 weeks now, have highlighted the coronavirus-5G link despite the fact that Google (as the self-appointed NWO Censor-in-Chief) is doing its best to hide and scrub all search results showing the connection. The coronavirus 5G connection doesn’t mean the bioweapons connection is false (it’s not a case of either-or), but rather broadens the scope of the entire event. Wuhan was one of the test cities chosen for China 5G rollout; 5G went live there on October 31st, 2019, almost exactly 2 months before the coronavirus outbreak began. Meanwhile, many scientific documents on the health effects of 5G have verified that it causes flu-like symptoms. This article reveals the various connections behind the coronavirus phenomenon, including how 5G can exacerbate or cause the kind of illness you are attributing to the new virus. The rabbit hole is deep so let’s take a dive.5G – A Type of Directed Energy Weapon. For the deeper background to 5G, read my 2017 article 5G and IoT: Total Technological Control Grid Being Rolled Out Fast. Many people around the world, including concerned citizens, scientist and even governmental officials, are becoming aware of the danger of 5G. This is why it has already been banned in many places worldwide, such as Brussels, the Netherlands and parts of Switzerland, Ireland, Italy, Germany, the UK, the USA and Australia. After all, 5G is not just the next generation of mobile connectivity after 4G; it is a radical and entirely new type of technology – a military technology used on the battlefield that is now being ‘deployed’ (military term) in the civilian realm. It is phased array weaponry being sold and disguised as primarily a communications system when the frequency bands it uses (24GHz – 100+GHz including MMW [millimeter waves]) are the very same ones used in Active Denial Systems, i.e. crowd control. Even mainstream Wikipedia describes Active Denial Systems as directed energy weaponry; it disperses crowds by firing energy at them, causing immediate and intense pain, including a sensation of the skin burning. Remember, directed energy weapons (DEW) are behind the fall of the Twin Towers on 9/11 and the fake Californian ‘wildfires’.Numerous scientists have warned of the dangerous health effects of 5G. For instance, in this 5G Appeal from 2017 entitled Scientists and Doctors Warn of Potential Serious Health Effects of 5G, scientists warned of the harmful of non-ionizing RF/EMF radiation:\n",
      "“Effects include increased cancer risk, cellular stress, increase in harmful free radicals, genetic damages, structural and functional changes of the reproductive system, learning and memory deficits, neurological disorders, and negative impacts on general wellbeing in humans. Damage goes well beyond the human race, as there is growing evidence of harmful effects to both plants and animals.”If you listen to Mark Steele and Barrie Trower, you’ll get an idea of the horrifying effects of 5G. In this interview, Trower echoes the above quote by stating how 5G damages the immune system of trees and kills insects. He reveals how in 1977, 5G was tested on animals in hopes of finding a weapon. The results were severe demyelination – stripping the protective sheath of nerve cells. Some nations are now noticing a 90% loss of insects (including pollinating insects like bees) which congregate around lamp-posts where 5G is installed.\n",
      "Wuhan Military Games and Event 201 Simulation.If you dig deep enough, some disturbing connections arise between 5G and the men who have developed or are developing vaccines for novel viruses like ebola, zika and the new coronavirus COVID-19. In a fantastic piece of research, an author under the pen name of Annie Logical wrote the article Corona Virus Fakery And The Link To 5G Testing that lays out the coronavirus 5G connection. There is a ton of information, so I will break it all down to make it more understandable.2019, Wuhan hosted the Military World Games and specifically used 5G (for the first time ever) for the event. Also on October 18th, 2019 in New York, the Johns Hopkins Center in partnership with World Economic Forum (WEF) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation hosted Event 201 – “A Global Pandemic Exercise” which is a simulation of a pandemic. Guess what virus they happen to choose for their ‘simulation’? A coronavirus! Guess what animal cells they use? Pig cells! (COVID-19 was initially reported to be derived from a seafood market, and the fish there are known to be fed on pig waste). Event 201 includes the UN (since the WEF now has a partnership agreement with UN), Big Pharma (Johnson and Johnson), Bill Gates (key figure in pushing vaccines, human microchipping and Agenda 2030) and both China and America’s CDC. Participants in Event 201 recommended that governments force social media companies to stop the spread of ‘fake news’ and that ultimately the only way to control the information would be for the WHO (World Health Organization, part of the UN) to be the sole central purveyor of information during a pandemic.Inovio, Electroporation and 5G.As reported on January 24th, 2020, US biotech and pharmaceutical company Inovio received a $9 million grant to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus. Inovio got the money grant from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), however they already have an existing partnership with CEPI; in April 2018 they got up to $56 million to develop vaccines for Lassa Fever and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). CEPI was founded in Davos by the governments of Norway and India, the Wellcome Trust … and the participants of Event 201: the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the WEF. CEPI’s CEO is the former director of BARDA (US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority) which is part of the HHS. Inovio claimed they developed a coronavirus vaccine in 2 hours! On the face of it such a claim is absurd; what is more likely is that they are lying or that they already had the vaccine because they had the foreknowledge that the coronavirus was coming and was about to be unleashed.So who owns and runs Inovio? Two key men are David Weiner and Dr. Joseph Kim. Weiner was once Kim’s university professor. Weiner was involved with developing a vaccine for HIV and zika (you can read my articles about zika here and here where I exposed some of the lies surrounding that epidemic). Kim was funded by Merck (a large Big Pharma company) and produced something called Porcine Circovirus (PCV 1 and PCV 2). As mentioned above, there is a link between pig vaccines/pig DNA and the coronavirus; Annie Logical notes that it “has long been established that seafood in the area is fed on pig waste.” Kim served a 5-year tenure as a member of the WEF’s Global Agenda Council – yet another organ pushing the New World Order One World Government under the banner of Agenda 2030 Global Governance.Weiner is an employee and advisor to the FDA, is considered a DNA technology expert and pioneered a new DNA transference method called electroporation – a microbiology technique which uses an electrical pulse to create temporary pores in cell membranes through which substances like chemicals, drugs or DNA can be introduced into the cell. This technique can be used to administer DNA vaccines, which inject foreign DNA into a host’s cells that changes the host’s DNA. This means if you take a DNA vaccine, you are allowing your DNA to be changed! As if vaccines weren’t already horrific enough … but here’s the kicker: electroporation uses pulsed waves. Guess what else uses pulsed waves? 5G! This is either a startling coincidence or evidence or a sinister coronavirus 5G-connection. Annie writes:“[T]he same action that 5G technology uses in pulsed waves and the coronavirus was reported to have started in an area in China that had rolled out 5G technology! So we can see how geneticists using scientists are tampering with the building blocks of our existence and what is disturbing is that Prof Wiener is a HIV pioneer and we know that soon after the Polio vaccines were given to millions in Africa that HIV emerged. They have perfected the art of injecting animal or bird DNA into human chromosomes which alters our DNA and causes things like haemorrhaging, fever, cancers and even death.”Speaking of HIV (which is not the same things as AIDS, but that is another story), remember also that a group of Indian scientists put out their research that the virus was manmade and had HIV inserts. They found that 4 separate HIV genes were randomly embedded within the coronavirus. These genes somehow converged to create receptor sites on the virus that were identical to HIV, which was a surprise due to their random placement. They also specifically stated that this was not likely to happen naturally (“unlikely to be fortuitous in nature”). In yet another example of egregious censorship, these scientists were pressured to withdraw their work.5G and Electroporation DNA Vaccines – Both Producing Pulsed EMF Waves.Consider the implications of this for a moment. The technology exists to use EMFs to open your very skin pores and inject foreign DNA into your bloodstream and cells. This is an extreme violation of your bodily sovereignty, and it can have long-term effects, because of genetic mutation – changing your very DNA which is the biological blueprint and physical essence of who you are.What if 5G mimics electroporation? What if 5G can do on a large scale what electroporation does on a small scale? We already know that 5G has the potential to be mutagenic (DNA-damaging). The frequencies that 5G uses, especially 75-100GHz, interact with the geometrical structure of our skin and sweat ducts, acting upon them like a transmission reaching an antenna, and fundamentally affecting us and our mood.What if 5G is being used to open up the skin of those in Wuhan so as to allow the new bioweapon coronavirus to infiltrate more easily?Mandatory Vaccines, Depopulation and Transhumanism.So, what’s at the bottom of the coronavirus-5G connection rabbit hole? I would suggest we find mandatory vaccine agenda, the depopulation agenda and transhumanist agenda (via DNA vaccines). The key figures and groups who appear to have planned this already have the vaccine in place, just as they did for the other epidemics that fizzled out (SARS, ebola and zika). Weiner even has links to HIV/AIDS, and if you dive into that as Jon Rappoport did, you find gaping holes in that story.It’s the same epidemic/pandemic game played out every 2-3 years. There’s a couple of versions. In the first version, you invent a virus, hype it up, get people scared, do ineffectual and inconclusive tests (e.g. like the PCR test which measures if a viral fragment is present but doesn’t tell you the quantities of whether it would actually causing the disease), inflate the body count, justify quarantine/martial law and brainwash people into thinking they have to buy the (toxic) vaccine and introduce mandatory vaccination. You don’t even need a real virus or pathogen for the version. In the second version, you create a virus as a bioweapon, release it as a test, pretend it was a natural mutation, watch how many people it kills (which helps with the eugenics and depopulation agendas), again justify martial law, again justify the need for mandatory vaccines and even pose as the savior with the vaccine that stops it. As a variation on this second version, you can even develop a race-specific bioweapon so as to reduce the population of rival nations or enemy races as a geopolitical strategy. This article suggests that the coronavirus targets Chinese people/Asians more than others, and certainly the official death count attests to that, although it’s always hard to trust governmental statistics. Annie Logical gives her take:The con job goes like this.Step 1) poison the population purposely to create disease that does not and would never occur naturally. Step 2) parlay the purposely created disease as being caused by something invisible, outside the realm of control or knowledge of the average person. Step 3) create a toxic vaccine or medication that was always intended to further poison the population into an early grave. Step 4) parlay the vaccine or medication poisoning as PROOF the disease, which never existed, is much worse than anticipated. Step 5) increase the initial poisoning, which is marketed as a fake disease, and also increase the vaccine and medication poisoning, to start piling the bodies into the stratosphere. Step 6) repeat as many times as possible upon an uninformed population because killing a population this way (the art of having people line up to kill themselves with poison……known as a “soft kill” method) is the only legal way to make sure such eugenic operations can be executed on mass and in plain sight.“DNA vaccines are a disturbing new advancement for transhumanism. After all, the objective of the transhumanist agenda is to merge man with machine, and in doing so, wipe out what fundamentally makes us human, so we can be controlled and overtaken by a deeply sinister and negative force. It’s all about changing us at the fundamental level, or attacking human sovereignty itself. DNA vaccines fit right in with that – literally changing your DNA by forcefully inserting foreign DNA to change your genetics, with consequences no one could possibly fully foresee and predict.One Last Coronavirus-5G Connection.Finally, I will finish with another coronavirus-5G connection. The word coronavirus itself refers to many kinds of viruses by that name, not just COVID-19. Guess who owns a patent for a coronavirus strain that can be used to develop a vaccine? The Pirbright Institute.  And guess who partially owns them? Bill Gates! As yoiu can read here Pirbright is being supported in their vaccine developement endeavors by a British company Innovate UK … who also funds and supports the rollout of 5G. Innovate UK ran a competition in 2018 with a £15 million share out to any small business that could produce vaccines for ‘epidemic’ potential.The Motivation to Hype and the Motivation to Downplay.History has shown that in cases of epidemics (or fake epidemics) there is almost always a morass of conflicting reports and contradictory information. In such situations, it can be very difficult to get to the bottom of the matter and find the truth. The conflict stems from the different motivations of nations, governments and other interested groups. Essentially, there are 2 main motivations: the motivation to hype (exaggerate and use fear to grab attention, sell something, make a group look bad/incompetent, make people scared, make the public accept mandatory vaccination and martial law) and the motivation to downplay (cover up and hide the true extent of the damage, morbidity or mortality so as to appear competent and in control, to lessen possible anger, backlash or disorder). Sometimes, these 2 motivations may drive the behavior of the same group, e.g. in the case of the Chinese Government, it has the motivation to hype (to get people afraid so they easily follow its draconian quarantine rules) and the motivation to downplay (so as to appear in the eyes of its people and the rest of the entire world to have the situation under control, to ensure saving face, credibility and a good reputation).Final Thoughts on the Coronavirus 5G Connection.Governments around the world have experimented with bioweapons both on their own citizens and foreign citizens, and even sold that research to other governments for their own benefit (e.g. Japan’s notorious Unit 731 which developed bioweapons in China, only to hand over that research to the US after losing World War 2). See Bioweapons: Lyme Disease, Weaponized Ticks, Plum Island & More for a brief history of the USG’s usage of weaponized ticks which resulted in Lyme Disease. The evidence that COVID-19 is a bioweapon is overwhelming – and so is the evidence that 5G is involved to either cause the flu-like symptoms/pneumonia people have been experiencing, and/or to exacerbate the virulity of the virus by weakening people’s immune systems and subjecting them to pulsed waves of EMF to open up their skin to foreign DNA fragments (including viruses).In this kinds of story, there are no major coincidences – only connections and conspiracies waiting to be uncovered.The Coronavirus 5G Connection and Coverup\n",

      "Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. wrote last week about Malibu police’s ticketing Point Dume surfers $1000 apiece for using the ocean during the quarantine. Was this merely an appalling police judgment at which we will laugh post-quarantine? Or does anyone else feel that this is the first wave of compliance and obedience training for something more permanent? Are powerful state and corporate entities using the current crisis to remove basic rights, and intensify pressures to promote vaccines and surveillance? Does anyone else feel the suffocating darkness of tyranny descending on our nation? And finally, does anyone share my dread that Bill Gates—and his long-time associate Tony Fauci—will somehow be running our Brave New World?Imagine a world where the government doesn’t need police officers to apprehend those surfers or ticket you when you violate social distancing with your girlfriend. Suppose that computers discover your beach trip by tracking your movements using a stream of information from your cell phone, your car, your GPS, facial recognition technology integrated with real-time surveillance from satellites, mounted cameras, and implanted chips. Desk-bound prosecutors or robots will notify you of your violation by text while simultaneously withdrawing your $1000 penalty in cryptocurrency from your payroll account. Welcome to Bill Gates’ America. It’s right around the corner.5G Strategies. Recently, Bill Gates announced his financial support for a $1 billion plan to blanket Earth in video surveillance satellites.  The company, EarthNow, will launch 500 satellites to live-stream monitor almost every “corner” of the Earth, providing instantaneous video feedback with only a one-second delay. According to Wikipedia, the company expects its customers to include “governments and large enterprises.” 5G Antennas­­­ deploying a vast array of ground-based 5G spy antennas. Through his Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Gates purchased 5.3 million Crown Castle shares currently worth a billion dollars. The Foundation’s second-largest tech holding after Microsoft, Crown Castle owns 5G infrastructure in every major U.S. market. It operates and leases more than 40000 cell towers, 65000 small cell nodes which are the central infrastructure for 5G and 75000 route miles of fiber to every major U.S. market that, instead of going to your home, providing you safe, fast, wired internet, has been confiscated to connect 5G cell towers.5G has almost nothing to do with improving your lives; it’s all about controlling your life, marketing products, and harvesting your data for Artificial Intelligence purposes. Data Mining\n",
      "Big Telecom, Big Data, and Bill Gates are baiting Americans into a digital tyranny-trap with million-dollar TV ads that pretend that their multi trillion-dollar  5G investment is about faster download speeds for video games and movies. But 5G has almost nothing to do with improving your lives; it’s all about controlling your life, marketing products, and harvesting your data for Artificial Intelligence. purposes. The 21st century’s “black gold” is data. 5G is the infrastructure for Gates’ “Internet of Things”—a world where tens of billions of “smart” devices: cell phones, computers, automobiles, garage door openers, Apple watches, baby diapers and even our living bodies—are wirelessly interconnected to enable Big Data to gather and sell our personal information.Gates, Elon Musk, Amazon, Facebook, and Telecom are launching the flagships for the new Gold Rush, a teeming fleet of 50000 satellites and a network of 2000000 ground antennas and cell towers to strip mine data from our smart devices. This microwave radiation-emitting spider web will allow Big Data/Big Telecom and Big Brother to capture what happens inside and outside every person at every moment of life. Gates will harvest, control, sort, characterize, analyze, and sell millions of terabytes of personal information from smart devices—private health data, medical records, our shopping habits, our biometric and behavioral responses to advertising, our children’s ability to learn, our facial expressions, and conversations overheard by Siri, Alexa, and your open cell phone’s microphones. His and other corporations will use these analytics to develop Artificial Intelligence (AI) and turn you into a predictable, easily-manipulated consuming machine.\n",
      "Next time you buy a “smart” device, remember the device is not the product—you are.Surveillance State & Transhumanism\n",
      "Corporations will use Gates’ 5G surveillance system to sell products and escalate AI capacity. Governments will use it to transition the globe to a totalitarian singularity more despotic than Orwell ever imagined. Silicon Valley titans like Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, and Google’s Chief Engineer Ray Kurzweil talk longingly of “transhumanism,” the process by which humanity will transition to become part-human, part-machine via genetic engineering and surgical implants.\n",
      "Bill Gates is investing heavily to accelerate this altered reality. His ambition to tag us all with injected subdermal vaccine data chips seems to be merely a steppingstone toward an all-encompassing surveillance state.Rewarding Compliance. Microsoft has patented a sinister technology that utilizes implanted sensors to monitor body and brain activity. It will reward compliant humans with crypto currency payments when they perform assigned activities.The Patent, WO |2020| 060606 has gained notoriety and the nickname “World Order 2020 666.” Microsoft describes this device as a “Crypto Currency System” and explains that it is “capable of” using body activity data to mine bitcoin in response to compliance with assigned tasks.People who agree to install the Microsoft harmful wireless sensors will receive periodic “duty” smart phone instructions to watch a certain advertisement, listen to a specific song, walk down a specific grocery store aisle, or to take a certain vaccine. This chip will collect data from embedded sensors that monitor brain waves, blood flow, and other body reactions. The system will transfer cryptocurrency into the subject’s account after completion of the assigned task. On the bright side, Microsoft’s dystopian invention should be a welcome source of income for the 40% of Americans put out of work by periodic COVID quarantines, by Musk’s self-driving electronic cars, which also rely on the 5G rollout, and by Artificial Intelligence, including robots. Will Gates sell the data we freely give him to companies that will take away our jobs?Owning Smart Cities. Maintaining and analyzing the data collected by a 5G infrastructure require massive computers housed in major data storage complexes. To keep control of this infrastructure, Bill Gates is building his own “smart city” in Arizona. According to KPNX-TV, he spent $80 million on a 24800-acre plot near Phoenix with the goal of turning it into a “smart city” where everything is interconnected via a wireless grid, including fleets of autonomous vehicles. The 80000 residents of Gates’ company town will mainly work in data centers.To consolidate his control over what people hear, learn, and think, Gates bought shares in Liberty Global, one of the largest international television and Internet companies, operating in 30 countries and growing.Controlling Reproduction.Gates will even control your body, your bedroom, your medicine cabinet and even women’s menstrual and ovulation cycles. He invested approximately $18 million in MicroCHIPS, a company that among other chip-based devices, develops birth-control implant chips with wireless on/off switches and chips for drug-delivery that allow a single implant to store and precisely deliver hundreds of therapeutic doses over months or years. The implants will be operated wirelessly by the patient to deliver medication. Knowing of Gates’ missionary zeal for population control, however, some customers might worry that the system could be remotely activated as well.The expansion of the wireless cloud between 2012–2015 was equivalent to adding 4.9 million cars to the roads.Controlling Climate: Geoengineering\n",
      "Gates’ apparent conviction that God has ordained him to use technology for humanity’s salvation is exemplified in one of his most ambitious projects. Gates is funding Harvard scientists to use Geoengineering to block the sun to reverse global warming and climate change.That project is a template for both hubris, hypocrisy and risk. The massive expansion of wireless use and the 5G wireless grid—for which Gates is a major player—is the most significant contributor to increased energy consumption. The expansion of the wireless cloud between 2012–2015 was equivalent to adding 4.9 million cars to the roads. 5G is expected to exponentially increase energy use by upwards of 170% by 2026. Proposing to use the wireless “smart” grid to combat the carbon footprint with geotechnology is a hare-brained scheme—not a solution for climate change.Cashless Society.To consolidate global control, Gates has declared war on cash, and the COVID-19 lockdowns have provided governments a convenient pretext for scuttling cash as a health hazard. Gates and his foundation are spearheading the global shift from a cash economy towards digital transactions. Gates and Microsoft are perfectly positioned to profit from a digital payments system. By controlling digital transactions (and removing cash), Gates can control and monitor everything commercial that a country and its citizens do.Western financial institutions—Mastercard, PayPal, Visa, eBay, and Citi—have long pushed for a cashless world. Electronic banking allows banks and financial consortiums to levy fees on every transaction.The Digital Economy will allow the Government to monitor and scrutinize every transaction, to freeze digital accounts, and to block “financial flows” to punish disobedience. Operating in a public-private partnership with government, tech billionaires will not only control the nation but will be able to micromanage the worldwide population. Digitized currency is the ultimate instrument of social control. After all, in a cashless society, survival is impossible without access to the digitized economic system. The poor—lacking bank accounts—will suffer disproportionately.Trillionaire Borg.While the lockdown is a cataclysm for the world economy, it is an opportunity for Gates. By purchasing our devalued assets at a penny on the dollar, Gates’ $100 billion might make him the world’s first trillionaire. But the quarantine is also an opportunity to enlarge his power and dominion. Under Gates’ leadership, Microsoft became known as “The Borg” because of his appetite for total market control. Now, Gates seeks to bring all humanity under his boot. His worship of technology and his megalomania threaten our freedoms, our democracy, our biology, our planet, our humanity, and our souls.The microwave radiation used for wireless surveillance of the world is not biologically tolerable, especially for developing children. Thousands of peer-reviewed, published studies abundantly document wireless technology’s profound, adverse, physical effects on humans, animals and plants. Sickness and environmental degradation from wireless technology is already widespread. Big Telecom control of U.S. and global regulatory agencies and media and Gates’ financial control of the World Health Organization have allowed a few billionaires to propagate the patent lie that wireless is safe.Gates’ technological dreams are not biologically sustainable. His Tower of Babel is bound to collapse, with catastrophic impact for lesser humans. It’s time to dismantle the Tower before it’s too late.The Brave New World of Bill Gates and Big Telecom\n",

      "HERE'S THE TRUTH BEHIND THE WUHAN VIRUS:Bill Gates & Barack Obama released a docuseries on Netflix called PANDEMIC in December right before the Wuhan virus was \"discovered.\"The docuseries pushed the need for the Gates Foundation to receive funding to carry on virus research to prevent the next PANDEMIC!Bill Gates funded the Wuhan lab in China that released the Wuhan virus and is already selling test kits. Coincidence? Bill Gates was a member of China's Academy of Sciences who built the lab and he was awarded their highest honor.The Wuhan virus was originally developed by Chinese scientists at the University of North Carolina by NIH grants approved by the Obama administration in 2012. To study the 2003 SARS coronavirus in a lab, NIH scientists developed a man-made version using BAT DNA. That's what the Communists unleashed. ab scientists developed a man-made version.The NIH defunded the \"dangerous\" UNC research because of the proven human-to-human transmission, so the Communist Chinese scientists left UNC and took their work to the NEWLY BUILT Wuhan lab in 2017 - funded by Gates, NIH & pals.The head of the Harvard Chemistry & Biology department, Charles Lieber, with ties to Gates & Epstein, was arrested for accepting bribes from the Communists. Did Epstein know what was coming?What was Charles Lieber's expertise? He invented a virus-sized transistor that could enter a human cell without harming it and be controlled remotely. Not kidding. The Pirbright Institute, funded by Bill Gates, owns the \"patent\" on Coronavirus genetic sequencing. They did simulation testing on a global PANDEMIC in 2019.The first case of Wuhan virus was reported in China on November 17th. Communists didn't inform the CDC until January 11th. WHO & Communist China said it wasn't spread by humans until January 21st. Cover up. How does the Wuhan virus spread and how does your body fight it?Bill Gates & Barack Obama docuseries marketed the need for a global \"universal\" vaccine to replace all other flu vaccines. I believe it will be used to deliver a human chip via nanotechnology designed to be monitored and controlled by Huawei's 5G network.17000 Americans in the US died of H1N1 flu from Mexico under Obama in 2009, many of them children, because he waited 6 months to do anything & never closed the border. Obama depleted America's critical medical supplies in 2009 and never restocked. The media said nothing about the 61 million who were infected in Obama's H1N1 crisis, but is creating a huge panic for Trump around US deaths from the Wuhan virus to destroy the US economy before the election. They tried to do the same thing with SARS under Bush in 2003.Know why the Commies unleashed the SWINE FLU virus in 2009 to infect 61 million & kill 17000? To convince the US to pass OBAMACARE! Thousands of people in the US have died from the common flu this year and the media says NOTHING about that - but is creating a huge panic around US deaths from the Wuhan virus.DR DREW: \"A bad flu season is 80000 dead. Which should you be worried about, influenza or Corona? It's not a trick question. What I have a problem with is the panic and the fact that businesses are getting destroyed and people's lives are getting upended. Not by the virus, but by the panic. The panic must stop, and the press they really need to be held accountable, because they are hurting people.\"Dozens out of the total US deaths from the Wuhan virus have come from ONE nursing home in Kirkland, Washington - the home state of Bill Gates where it all started.Half the staff at that nursing home were infected with Wuhan virus. They appear to be the carriers. The nursing home draws employees from a large Chinese population across the border in Canada. I believe Gates placed carriers in vulnerable locations for the narrative and funding.Other deaths around the country occurred in nursing facilities owned by the same company who owns the Kirkland facility! Half the deaths around the world occurred in nursing homes! Right after the first deaths were reported in Bill Gates backyard, the Never Trump Governor declared a national emergency & Congress approved over $8 billion - even though Trump asked for only a quarter of that. Much of the funding will flow to Gates' global \"research\" partners.Suddenly Bill Gates says his \"foundation\" will offer in-home testing kits where you swab your nose with a Q-Tip and send it to his labs. How convenient and timely! I think Gates developed the home-testing kits in order to secure access to all our DNA!Communist China tried to STEAL a patent from a US company that manufactured a treatment right AFTER they announced the virus to the world. Gilead's drug is under clinical trials. The same treatments, tests & blood plasma used on SARS patients in 2003 & MERS patients in 2013 work on Wuhan patients. They are all related viruses. They don't want you to know that. Fauci is covering that up. Why? Because he's working with Gates on a \"vaccine.\"90% of those who tested positive on the Princess Cruise ship were CREW MEMBERS. Meaning the crews are carriers and are infecting passengers. Who put them there?The virus started in South Korea because the leaders of a \"doomsday\" cult went to Wuhan, China and went back and infected 8000 of their members. Who paid them to do that? South Korean President Moon Jae-in allowed 5 million Chinese to enter the country after the initial outbreak!In Italy, the virus started in a hospital filled with sick elderly people in a small town in northern Italy -- spread by a 38-year old carrier from Wuhan, who recovered. Who put him there? Over 100000 Chinese migrants from Wuhan own & work in the textile/leather industry in Northern Italy. In 2019, Italy and Communist China signed an agreement to jointly promote China's Belt & Road Initiative. Partners in Wuhan Virus! Italy admits they are coding ALL deaths to Wuhan and letting the elderly die.ER doctors say socialized medicine is so bad in Italy that people avoid clinics and go straight to the hospital where they are housed with the elderly & sick - that's why the virus spread so fast. Under Italy's socialist healthcare, if you're 80+, you can be denied treatment & coverage and left to die. Now you know why so many elderly are dying in Europe.Iran's leaders suddenly became infected after Iran's foreign leader met with John Kerry in Munich and laughed about the Wuhan virus on camera. Almost like he was told to go home, create panic and spread the virus. Why? To try to force Trump to drop sanctions. Iran – like Italy, a partner in China’s Belt and Road initiative – continued flights between Iran and China. The first outbreak was in the city of Qom where most of the Chinese projects are set up. WHO: 4 countries with economic & political ties (Communist China, South Korea, Italy, Iran) facilitated virus spread around the globe. Italy, Iran, South Korea & China, home to 90% of virus cases, are ALL partners in the Communist Party's One Belt, One Road scheme!All those videos out of Communist China of people dying on the streets and thrashing bodies on gurnies from the virus - what did they really die from? Is Huawei's 5G network delivering something nefarious to accelerate a coronavirus' ability to suffocate people?Thousands of people from Wuhan China have protested against the Communist Party's plans to build an organic waste \"incinerator\" plant in their city. They are silent now! What did they really want the incinerator for?Real videos show Hong Kong freedom fighters being rounded up in handcuffs and sent off to the \"hospital\" where it's likely their organs are harvested and they are cremated.Real videos show elderly people in Communist China trapped in buildings and left to die with no food.Real videos show that Communist China installed major NEW surveillance cameras and technology to monitor people on the street & in their offices since the virus was released.Real videos show the Chinese people yelling \"IT'S ALL FAKE\" from high rises as the Communists pretend to care for them on the streets below.The Chinese are now being forced to use an app which tells them when they can come and go and tracks their every move. How did the Communists suddenly develop this technology in a month? This was part of the plan and put in place while they were under \"quarantine.\"After Trump closed travel from Communist China in January, the Chinese blamed the US and threatened to hold back our pharmaceuticals unless we opened travel back up again. They didn't expect him to do that - that thwarted their plans to seed the US with more cases.I believe the virus is no more dangerous than the common flu - for healthy people - but has been engineered to be highly infectious and impact the elderly & sick. Thankfully, it is NOT widely affecting children & young adults like pandemic flu does.Two Stanford doctors believe that the COMMON flu is 10 times more deadly than Wuhan virus.  Stanford doctors.I believe the virus was unleashed by the Communist Party to scare the Chinese people back into their homes and stop the Hong Kong & Taiwanese pro-freedom protests.I believe the virus was unleashed by the Communists to crash the US economy & drive people away from Trump rallies. So far, they've lied about everything!I believe the virus was unleashed to help the Communists round up dissidents, assert global control and to cull the elderly and weak.I believe the virus was unleashed to scare the American people into accepting SOCIALIZED medicine and total vote-by-mail. ALL respiratory viral outbreaks peak in March and end in April. I believe this one too.The SARS Coronavirus panic dropped the market 20% in March 2003, under Bush, and it came roaring back even higher by July. In other words, they've done this before to a Republican administration before an election.Wuhan virus is impacting less than 1% of the population in areas of \"high\" infection: China (.12%) S. Korea (.21%) Italy (.037%) - although the fake news media makes it sounds like 50% of the population is sick. Why are so many leaders testing positive for Wuhan Virus? Because Communist China brought the scheme to Davos in January!The fake news reported that Brazil's conservative President, Bolsonaro, tested positive for Wuhan virus. His son says that's a LIE. SOUTH KOREA FACTS: Of 179160 tests completed, 96% tested negative, 4% positive. 51 people died or .69% of confirmed cases.Now the fake news is trying to distance Wuhan from the virus -- and so is Communist China. That means we're right over the target.The New York Times is calling people \"racist\" for using the term \"Wuhan Virus.\" I guess they forgot that's what they used to call it before their masters in the Communist Party told them not to!Suddenly the liberal Governor of New York says the State will start selling their own brand of hand sanitizer made by prison inmates! How long was that in the works?Did you know WHO says 67% of ALL people under 50 in the WORLD are infected with HSV-1 (herpes) virus? Many NEVER show symptoms. Think about that. Are we permanently quarantined for herpes virus? NO.Democrats hope to hype the Wuhan virus for months to destroy the economy, bring down the market, shut down Trump rallies, gatherings, debates, the conventions & force ALL voting by mail or phone! They basically said that tonight on MSNBC & CNN. Democrats are masters at rigging absentee ballots!UPDATE 3/12/20: I heard a few things today from sources I trust I thought you should know:South Korea has already tested 200000 people and is testing 20000 people per day and finding a fatality rate of less than .7% - which I trust.The reason Trump shut down travel from the EU is because the newest Wuhan virus cases in America are from travelers who have visited the EU. The EU has NOT been shutting down its borders to Communist China like we have since 1/31 - in fact the EU is under siege by millions of migrants from who knows where clamoring to invade Greece & Italy.The majority of people who are dying from the Wuhan virus are 80+ with underlying conditions such as emphysema, heart disease or cancer. Young & healthy people have a very low risk - but they CAN transmit it to their elderly parents & grandparents. So, be vigilant. The average age of those who succumb to the Wuhan virus has been confirmed at 81 years old.  Many deaths in Communist China appear to come from elderly residents in Hubei province who received NO care at all and were left to fend for themselves. The reason the Wuhan Virus impacts the elderly & vulnerable is simply because their immune systems are not as strong. Many cases in Communist China were actually infected healthcare workers who were not properly safeguarded from patients and ended up re-infecting more patients. China told their healthcare workers there was no contagion problem for weeks, when there was.The same is true in Washington State & California - nursing home employees & cruise ship crew members are spreading the virus to people - not the other way around.As I mentioned many times, historically, Coronavirus outbreaks PEAK in March and start to die out by the end of April. Coronaviruses like cooler drier weather. A second round can start up again in October after a summer hiatus. Of those tested who were positive for ANY respiratory virus, ONLY 2% tested positive for Wuhan. Meaning 98% have the common flu.In order to STOP THE SPREAD in America, during the peak transmission months of March & April, President Trump ASKED businesses, sports teams and major events to suspend activity for 8 weeks to reduce transmission during this peak time. Makes perfect sense to stop it in its tracks and lower the bell curve. What if the shutdown is NOT about Wuhan Virus at all? The bright side of the panic is that liberals are suddenly wanting to buy guns, close borders, build walls, honor elders, cut taxes, stop human trafficking and vaccinate their children.REAL News about the Wuhan Virus\n",

No wonder there were shortages.PENCE: 3M in Minnesota has the capability to produce 35 MILLION masks per month but FORMER regulations only allowed them to distribute 5 MILLION of the 35 MILLION masks to hospitals. We got RID of those obstacles last night with new legislation.IMHO, the Communist Party of China used what, we in marketing, call the hub/spoke concept of transmission. They barricaded the landlocked city of Wuhan to keep their PEOPLE IN and protect the rest of China, while allowing virus carriers to FLY OUT and infect the world. PURE EVIL.How many members of Congress knew of the Communist's Wuhan virus scheme and sold off stocks before the market started crashing?

We can bring our finances back quickly. We can't bring the people back.PENCE: The risk of complications from the Wuhan virus is very low but it spreads fast & is about 3 times as contagious as the flu.It appears most transmission comes from INFECTED HARD SURFACES and thankfully the virus dies on most SURFACES within days.Experts say the global 1918 flu pandemic that killed 50 million also started in China. Most flu viruses originate there.Maybe the Wuhan flu is the wake up call that America needs. Imagine the money, time and human life we would save by closing our borders and rethinking our immigration policies.Each year up to 20% of the US population is infected with flu imported from China, resulting in 31.4 million outpatient visits, 200000 hospitalizations and up to 80000 deaths.

The Bank of China was caught laundering money in Italy so the Communists created a social media campaign called \"Hug a Chinese\" to shame Italians as \"racist.\" It worked to spread the virus fast!Why was Italy heavily infected with virus?

      "So it would seem that the coronavirus plan is working extremely well. The Plandemic that Bill Gates predicted 5 years ago, is now playing out live on all screens across the planet. It is not enough that people are losing work and being crippled by the orchestrated lock down/house arrest, but it cannot end until the project is complete and we are all vaccinated as stated by the new world leader Mr Bill Gates. Bill Gates joined “FOX News Sunday” host Chris Wallace yesterday to discuss his accurate prediction he made five years ago was that the deadliest event to face humanities future was not war, but a virus. “Not missiles but microbes” he stated.Apparently he has been trying to prevent this, but if you invest in a vaccine company and a Microchip ID system, how can you appear to be in any way neutral, when the business driver appears to be working so well? He is a business man. This is a very lucrative business. Bear in mind he would not give these vaccines to his own kids. This is his business, he understands the consequences and in amongst this noise, it was ruled in court that The CDC cannot deny vaccines cause autism. According to American Truth Today, published in January this year, when all this began: “Believe it or not, the coronavirus strain that’s currently spreading throughout China and abroad is a patented virus that’s owned by an entity called The Pirbright Institute, which is partially funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.The patent page for coronavirus explains that it “may be used as a vaccine for treating and/or preventing a disease, such as infectious bronchitis, in a subject”… A close look at the patent page also shows that the Pirbright Institute owns all sorts of other virus patents, including one for African swine fever virus, which is listed as a “vaccine.”The way this whole coronavirus situation is taking shape would seem to be exactly what Gates once proposed as a “solution” to the alleged problem of “overpopulation,” as he is now well known for saying in a previous Ted Talks and in many other places, for it would seem to have been a bit of a big thing for him, for how do we solve the problem of overpopulation he has mused this question for many years. It’s easy these days to cut off any counter viewpoint as “conspiracy,” but follow the money trail and it often leads to the culprit, as well as to the boss. For the boss here is very much Mr Gates and his technocracy cronies. His endless media appearances, are keeping him busy, this is his time to shine and show the world he was right. Of course due to tax laws and corporate misconduct the guise of charity is a perfect cover and so hence the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation was born, for a donation from a charity is not seen as an investment. Even though charities are also businesses that make a fortune. They still have shareholders who want a profit not a loss.Most people think small, Mr Gates thinks big. Of course. You don’t get to be the second richest man on the planet by playing Mr Nice Guy throughout your career, buying every decent start up and swallowing all your competition. Unless its in front of camera of course. And doe Bill knows the power of the media? According to Quartz, he said in 2017: “If anybody doesn’t think we need the media that’s a little scary.”For he is a major investor and understands not only the need for acquiring media companies, but how the game really works, getting his message out in the traditional media world, as well as all the other platforms. He is a baby of the digital age and was fortunate enough to be able to pile a monopoly of media companies: “If anybody says we don’t need the media, that’s a little scary… this idea that everybody watched the same media, the media was completely neutral—we never really achieved that ideal… which is why having many media groups and reducing barriers to entry—which the digital technology has done—is a very good thing.”\n",
      "Whilst this is polite board room speak for buy everyone, and controll the message. But he appears to be pleased with the way it is going and there is still more to be done, as he states that people should be “waking up to a new reality.”Bill Gates, is not an elected official. As one of the wealthiest persons on the planet, he has influenced public health policy for decades, spanning the administration of several U.S. Presidents. This is not new to him. Trump is only here for a term or two. Gates has been at this for decades. Nobody contributes more to the World Health Organization than Bill Gates does, either directly through his Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, or through other organizations and enterprises he funds. The bulk of spending through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is for the development of vaccines. They are behind the Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunization (GAVI) organization, which supplements what WHO spends on vaccine development.He doesn’t need the US Senate, when he holds the keys to the entire world. He is richer and more powerful than most countries in the world, and he is accountable to nobody. Event 201 briefing. Bill and Melinda Gates hosted “Event 201” back in October, described as a “high-level pandemic exercise” back in October with major business leaders and politicians, that involved discussions about how “public / private partnerships will be necessary during the response to a severe pandemic in order to diminish large-scale economic and societal consequences.” Held in partnership with the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and the World Economic Forum, this latest endeavor by Bill Gates is highly suspicious, to say the least, especially when considering that it was held just in time for the coronavirus outbreak. Dr Fauci. So now, alongside his friend Dr Fauci, Bill appears pleased with the way things are going and the work Dr Fauci is doing. The work that he paid for, as they have an agreement. However private or public that may be, there is at least a ginormous conflict of interest here, if nothing else.How can you have a top advisor that also works for a company that is set to reap huge rewards from the very advice he gives?

      "It’s like having Ronald McDonald working for the food board, or the department of health. Or, does he already? Dr Fauci was granted an eye watering sum to get this job done. This from the Patriots for Truth website March 6th entitled: CDC propagandist Anthony S. Fauci, MD received major funding from The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation—who also funded the Coronavirus patent holder The Pirbright Institute (UK) Fauci just recently received $100 million grant from Gates. The Gates Foundation is also a major funder of The Pirbright Institute (UK) with DARPA, The Wellcome Trust (UK), DARPA, WHO, EU, DERA. Whilst a handful of brave doctors are coming out and questioning the numbers, most remain silent, like the rest of the world, they are fearful of losing their jobs.How can we really be so sure that the Coronavirus is responsible for the deaths mentioned, when the tests are questionable and death certificates are being fudged?Please watch this video where Montana physician Dr. Annie Bukacek discusses how COVID 19 death certificates are being manipulated. Dr. Bukacek is a long time Montana physician with over 30 years’ experience practicing medicine. Signing death certificates is a routine part of her job:Dr Birx. Dr. Debra Birx, the other doctor on the White House Coronavirus Task Force, has worked with Dr. Fauci on HIV/AIDS research and vaccine development, and also has financial ties to Bill Gates. According to Patrick Howley, writing for the National File, Dr. Birx discarded several proposed models for the Coronavirus outbreak and chose a single model funded by Bill Gates, via the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME). (Source.) Howley also reports: Deborah Birx Sits on the Board of The Global Fund, which is heavily funded by Bill Gates’ organizational network, as journalist Jordan Schactel discovered. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation gave the Global Fund a $750 million promissory note in 2012.The Global Fund explains, “The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is a key partner of the Global Fund, providing cash contributions, actively participating on its board and committees, and supporting the Global Fund’s advocacy, communications and fundraising efforts. The Gates Foundation has contributed US$2.24 billion to the Global Fund to date, and pledged US$760 million for the Global Fund’s Sixth Replenishment, covering 2020-2022.” ID2020 So lets look at The Gates Foundations other investments, sorry donations. As his planned ID2020 also comes into fruition in the year of its naming, which ties it all up nicely with a neat little bow.The ID2020 Alliance combines vaccines with implantable microchips to create your digital ID. In a Reddit Q&A, Gates revealed his plan to use ‘digital certificates’ to identify those who have been tested for COVID-19: Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates will launch human-implantable capsules that have ‘digital certificates’ which can show who has been tested for the coronavirus and who has been vaccinated against it.Whilst the Gates Foundation has just offered a Grant to Cortellis, seemingly for this very thing, this from Bio World’s article entitled: Centre for Innovation in Regulatory Science Awarded a $1.09m Grant to Help Accelerate Registration of Medicines in Low and Middle Income Countries. London, UK.  March 9, 2020: The Centre for Innovation in Regulatory Science (CIRS), a “neutral and independent”, international member-based organisation headquartered in the UK, has been awarded a phase two grant of $1.09m by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to continue their collaborative endeavours to expedite patient access to medicines in specific areas of greatest medical need in Low and Middle Income Countries. For it is the Low to middle classes who are having the most children. The grant has been awarded to CIRS for the purpose of ‘Tracking Regulatory Performance Metrics in Low and Middle Income Countries’. Whilst DNA Electronics has also earned a breakthrough device designation for Lidia-seq, also according to BioWorld: DNA Electronics Ltd. (DNAe) won a U.S. FDA breakthrough device designation for its semiconductor-based DNA sequencing technology Lidia-seq and for the first assay based on the platform, which will detect bloodstream infections and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes at point of care. The designation paves the way for clinical trials and will bolster work the company is doing to adapt the technology for the diagnosis of COVID-19 infections. Meanwhile, DNAnudge Ltd., another company set up by DNAe’s founder Chris Toumazou, reported it has repurposed its consumer DNA device to detect COVID-19. The U.K.government has ordered 10000 of its testing cartridges, which use optical technology to identify the coronavirus. DNAe says Lidia-seq will bring genomic analysis into use at point of need. The entire process is automated, with all processing taking place in a single, hands-free cartridge. The compact device can be used by non-specialists. “We can now go from raw specimen directly to actionable result, and have automated the entire process,” said Samuel Reed, president of DNAe. “Apart from [increased] accuracy, we can go rapidly from a sample and we can do it in a diversity of environments,” he told BioWorld. Lidia-seq can identify pathogens and AMR markers in under three hours, allowing patients to receive targeted, rather than broad spectrum anti-infectives. So whatever the register says about your DNA, it will decide what to inject in you!Is it just me, or is that not pretty scary when we consider Bill Gates obsession with population control and reducing the number of children we go onto produce?What’s to say these devices, or implants will not also mean there are less births? How will we as ordinary people know what these ingredients are?\n",
      "How will we know that our children will not be unfertilised at this point? How will we know any of it unless we at least consider the inherent dangers of a machine manipulating and altering our DNA.Vaccines contain foreign DNA already Vaccines cause autism already Vaccines disrupt your immune system and turn it against you already The article goes on to say:“DNAe’s sequencing technology uses standard silicon chips to detect the hydrogen ions that are released when DNA or RNA bases pair with their opposite number. The signal registers as electrical impulses”. In November 2018, DNAe was the first to demonstrate it is possible to sequence the DNA of bacteria directly from an unprocessed blood sample. That completed the initial phase of a US$51.9 million contract with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority and released $10.9 million for the development of the prototype device.DNAe will benefit from the extra FDA input, Reed said. “We can have frequent and informal interactions, whereas the [conventional] process is more formal. It will help smooth the path,” he said.Sure, so now we don’t even need approval to see what is actually happening to your DNA, or what is being pumped into your veins, as this is based on informal hidden technology?Technology that can manipulate your very DNA. What better way to create the solution to the problem that is over population? Reduce the population and the people’s ability to decide anything for themselves via a piece of AI software? Control their reality. And of course now, COVID-19 is the time, the reason, the foe that must be slayed:In the face of the current pandemic, DNAe has been working to apply the technology to detecting SARS-CoV-19. “We are doing testing in-house with [Lidia-seq] with the coronavirus sequence, to show it could be directly applied,” Reed said.The test, which uses a cheek swab, has now been converted to detect the RNA of SARS-CoV-19. The repurposed test, which delivers results in just over an hour, has been clinically validated in an initial trial in COVID-19 patients.Reduce people’s fertility rates, life expectancy and movement… Problem solved? Scary stuff. But if everybody can get back to their old lives, break out of the prison that is their own home, then of course people will be queuing up for the vaccines and we can see this all being a very successful set of investments.

      "It’s been 2 weeks since we first wrote about the novel coronavirus (nCoV-2019) originating in China. Since then, the official numbers have skyrocketed from 630 infections and 17 deaths to over 24000 infections and roughly 500 deaths.NaturalNews reports that China is actually keeping two sets of numbers, and that the actual numbers are much higher than the “official” numbers, with over 154000 infected and almost 25000 dead. Several nations have evacuated their citizens from china, while airlines have shut down flights to China and other countries.On January 31st, President Trump declared that the novel coronavirus presents a public health emergency in the United States. That same day, under the guidance of the CDC, the White House Coronavirus Task Force announced a 14-day quarantine for Americans who recently visited Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak.Over the last two weeks, the Chinese government has quarantined roughly 50 million people in over a dozen cities – the largest quarantine in human history. Cruise liners carrying infected passengers have been denied entry into Japan and passengers will be quarantined on the ships for at least two weeks.Major manufacturers like Apple and Adidas have shut down their stores and plants in China, and airlines have placed over 30000 employees on unpaid leave. In the U.S., hundreds of Americans have been evacuated from the Wuhan area and will be immediately quarantined on military bases.The measures being taken by governments around the world are drastic and unprecedented. The authority that these institutions are willing to assume in the face of a “health emergency” is concerning… and it’s only the beginning.Social Media Increases Censorship. In the wake of the new virus, Facebook announced that it would remove any content about the coronavirus “with false claims or conspiracy theories that have been flagged by leading global health organizations and local health authorities,” saying such content would violate its ban on misinformation leading to “physical harm.”This is a much more aggressive policy than Facebook has taken before. Up to this point, censorship efforts have mostly involved restricting search results and advertising while still allowing the content to remain published. The ban will also apply to Instagram, which will subject users to pop-up ads when they click on hashtags related to the virus.Google has followed suit, pushing updates from the WHO to the top of search results involving the coronavirus. YouTube, owned by Google, will also make it harder to find independent information about the virus, promoting videos from public health organizations and mainstream media outlets.Twitter said Wednesday that it would begin prompting users who search for the coronavirus to first visit official channels of information about the illness. In the United States, for example, Twitter directs users to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, beneath a bold headline that reads: “Know the facts.”The campaign is running in 15 locations, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Australia, and “will continue to expand as the need arises,” the company said in a blog post.Twitter has even banned financial market website Zero Hedge from the social media platform after it published an article linking a Chinese scientist to the outbreak of the fast-spreading coronavirus last week.Zero Hedge had their account permanently suspended for violating “platform manipulation policy”. The account had 670000 followers as of its suspension. The suspension was in response to a complaint by Buzzfeed which said Zero Hedge had released the personal information of a scientist from Wuhan in an article that made allegations about coronavirus having been concocted “as a bioweapon.” The article was titled “Is This the Man Behind the Global Coronavirus Pandemic?”\n",
      "Tik-Tok, a Chinese-owned company, already removes posts and blocks users. This is standard practice in communist China, where state-run media and extreme surveillance of its citizens makes it easy to control what information is released.The Digital Police State. The effort in China to silence free speech and control the narrative regarding coronavirus has been aggressive. According to a Reuters report:At least 16 people have been arrested over coronavirus posts in Malaysia, India, Thailand, Indonesia and Hong Kong, while Singapore has used its controversial new “fake news” law, POFMA, to force media outlets and social media users to carry government warnings on their posts and articles saying they contain falsehoods.\n",
      "“Fortunately, we now have POFMA to deal with this fake news,” said Lawrence Wong, one of the ministers heading a Singapore government task force to halt the spread of the virus.At least five people were arrested and released on bail in India’s southwestern state of Kerala over WhatsApp messages, said Aadhithya R, District Police Chief of Thrissur. Six people were arrested in Malaysia on suspicion of spreading false news.In Vietnam, where an army of cyber-censors tracks social media comments for the communist government, at least nine people have been fined and three celebrities asked to explain their actions over posts about coronavirus.Thailand hailed the success of an “anti-fake news centre” it set up last year. Dozens of staff reviewed nearly 7600 posts in four days from Jan. 25 – leading to 22 posts being highlighted as false on its website and two arrests under computer crimes laws.“The anti-fake news centre is working intensively to verify these rumours and communicating truth to the people,” said Digital Minister Puttipong Punnakanta.\n",
      "To make matters worse, it turns out that Chinese officials arrested 8 medical professionals who tried to warn people of the disease back in December. Each detainee was part of a medical school’s alumni group on WeChat, a popular social network in China, and they were concerned that SARS, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, was back. (SARS is a type of coronavirus.).According to The Daily Beast:It wasn’t long before police detained them. The authorities said these eight doctors and medical technicians were “misinforming” the public, that there was no SARS, that the information was obviously wrong, and that everyone in the city must remain calm. On the first day of 2020, Wuhan police said they had “taken legal measures” against the eight individuals who had “spread rumors.”Since then, the phenomenal spread of the virus has created cracks even within the normally united front of the Chinese Communist Party. “It might have been fortunate if the public had believed the ‘rumor’ and started to wear masks, carry out sanitization measures, and avoid the wild animal market,” a judge of China’s Supreme People’s Court wrote online last Tuesday.Li Wenliang, a doctor who was among the eight people who tried to sound the alarm before the coronavirus infected many thousands and killed hundreds, was diagnosed as someone infected with the coronavirus and is being treated at a hospital. Authorities are still actively censoring social-media posts and news articles that question the government’s response to the outbreak. One Wuhan man, Fang Bin, uploaded footage of corpses in a van and a hospital in Wuhan and was then tracked down and taken into custody. His laptop was confiscated, and he had to pedal for three hours on a bicycle to get home after he was questioned, warned, and released. His coronavirus video went viral.Experts agree that this kind of aggressive censorship could make the virus even more lethal. Leaders within the Chinese government have put their political interests before the good of their people, and the results have been catastrophic thus far.In recent days, medical experts have found evidence that the origin of the outbreak was not a seafood market in Wuhan, as the Chinese government initially reported. That evidence also suggests that the first human infections occurred in November, if not earlier, rather than in early December.The true scope of the disease may be worse than we’ve been told. Public officials have been deleting investigative reports by journalists in the area, while many patients who have died of “regular pneumonia” were never tested for coronavirus.Given the rapid spread of the virus and the enormous economic effects expected, censorship and propaganda are certain to continue — and to extend beyond China’s borders — as the regime seeks to protect its hold on power and international reputation. While Chinese authorities assure domestic and international audiences that their efforts will contain the outbreak, censors are busily deleting social media posts and journalists’ reporting that contradict the official narrative.\n",
      "An International Conspiracy.Lies and secrecy are common in most communist nations, and China is no exception. It is well-documented that the information released during the SARS outbreak of 2003 was significantly redacted to minimize its true impact.But what about here in America?We’ve already reported that, in 2015, a patent was filed by The Pirbright Institute for the live, attenuated coronavirus. The application claims that the new virus could be used to create a vaccine for treating or preventing respiratory viruses. The patent was awarded in 2018.The Pirbright Institute is funded by the UK Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs, the WHO, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. All of these entities have been loud supporters of mandatory vaccinations and more government control based on “health concerns.”And for several years, Bill Gates has been telling us that a pandemic is coming, and in November of 2019, collaborating with the World Economic Forum, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation hosted “Event 201” where they ran a simulation of a coronavirus pandemic.It should come as no surprise that – just yesterday – Bill and Melinda Gates announced that they would be donating $100 million to coronavirus vaccine research and treatment efforts, which were announced as part of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) request for $675 million in global contributions to fight the spread of the disease.You can bet your bottom dollar that this vaccine will be heavily pushed on all Americans, and probably mandated in some states and cities. But what’s the truth behind the coronavirus?The Truth About Coronavirus. Officials would have you believe that the new coronavirus began when someone ate contaminated bat soup at a Wuhan seafood and animal market, but that is a flat-out lie. And a paper published in The Lancet last week has the proof.The paper, written by a large group of Chinese researchers from several institutions, offers details about the first 41 hospitalized patients who had confirmed infections with what has been dubbed 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). In the earliest case, the patient became ill on 1 December 2019 and had no reported link to the seafood market, the authors report.“No epidemiological link was found between the first patient and later cases,” they state. Their data also show that, in total, 13 of the 41 cases had no link to the marketplace. “That’s a big number, 13, with no link,” says Daniel Lucey, an infectious disease specialist at Georgetown University.Lucey says if the new data are accurate, the first human infections must have occurred in November 2019—if not earlier—because there is an incubation time between infection and symptoms surfacing. If so, the virus possibly spread silently between people in Wuhan—and perhaps elsewhere—before the cluster of cases from the city’s now-infamous Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market was discovered in late December. “The virus came into that marketplace before it came out of that marketplace,” Lucey asserts.The much more likely scenario is that a weaponized version of the virus was released (whether intentionally or not) by Wuhan’s Institute of Virology – a level-4 biohazard lab which was studying “the world’s most dangerous pathogens.”The institute even has an ad for researchers to help use “bats to research the molecular mechanism that allows Ebola and SARS-associated coronaviruses to lie dormant for a long time without causing diseases.”The job is for a lab run by Dr. Peng Zhou, Ph.D., a researcher at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and Leader of the Bat Virus Infection and Immunization Group. Since 2009, Peng has been the leading Chinese scientist researching the immune mechanism of bats carrying and transmitting lethal viruses in the world.His primary field of study is researching how and why bats can be infected with some of the most nightmarish viruses in the world including Ebola, SARS and Coronavirus, and not get sick. As part of his studies, Peng also researched mutant Coronavirus strains that overcame the natural immunity of some bats; these are “superbug” Coronavirus strains, which are not resistant to any natural immune pathway, and now appear to be out in the wild.The institute is about 13 miles away from the market that China claims as the source of the outbreak.A study by 5 Greek scientists (published 1/27/2020) examined the genetic relationships of nCoV-2019 and found that “the new coronavirus provides a new lineage for almost half of its genome, with no close genetic relationships to other viruses within the subgenus of sarbecovirus,” and has an unusual middle segment never seen before in any coronavirus.What exactly does that mean?  Basically, this means that we are dealing with a brand new type of ‘man-made’ coronavirus. The study’s authors rejected the original hypothesis that the virus originated from random natural mutations between different coronaviruses.Dany Shoham, a former Israeli military intelligence officer who has studied Chinese biological warfare, has also linked the virus to China’s covert biological weapons program. Mr. Shoham holds a doctorate in medical microbiology. From 1970 to 1991, he was a senior analyst with Israeli military intelligence for biological and chemical warfare in the Middle East and worldwide.“Certain laboratories in the institute have probably been engaged, in terms of research and development, in Chinese [biological weapons], at least collaterally, yet not as a principal facility of the Chinese BW alignment,” Mr. Shoham told The Washington Times. Work on biological weapons is conducted as part of dual civilian-military research and is “definitely covert,” he said.In a sad turn of events, the Chinese doctor who tried to warn others about the Wuhan coronavirus, has died. Li Wenliang, a 34-year-old doctor working in Wuhan, raised the alarm about the novel coronavirus on December 30th. Soon after he posted the message, Li was accused of rumor-mongering by the Wuhan police. He was one of several medics targeted by police for trying to blow the whistle on the deadly virus in the early weeks of the outbreak. Li was hospitalized on January 12th after contracted the virus from one of his patients, and he was confirmed to have nCoV-2019 on February 1st.The question is If the Chinese made this virus in a lab, what was their purpose? And why did they arrest the doctor who tried to inform the rest of the world?The world needs an answer.Wolves in Sheep’s Clothing. As long as we continue to believe the lies promulgated by communist state-run media, we’re going to stay in the dark. Government agencies around the world have been happy to sensationalize the virus as an excuse for extreme control over their citizens.People are being detained and quarantined. Travel and business have been seriously disrupted. The global economy is in turmoil. Scientists and journalists are being silenced and even arrested. And social media companies founded in the freest country on earth are deleting any content that suggests that this is a man-made problem.People are scared. Tens of millions have had their lives put on hold. Hundreds have died in the last week.But don’t worry… be healthy! There are herbs and natural substances that can have a profound effect on viruses and your immune function.Surprise surprise!  Bill Gates, the WHO, and everyone else in the medical industry are working on a nCoV-2019 vaccine … a vaccine that they patented half a decade before the virus appeared … a virus that was created in a lab.But that’s just a “coincidence,” right?Here’s another incredible “coincidence”.For several years, Bill Gates has been telling us that a pandemic is coming, and on October 18, 2019 (collaborating with the World Economic Forum), the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation hosted “Event 201” where they ran a simulation of a coronavirus pandemic.A meeting of the “globalist health minds” occurred on November 6th to discuss its findings with 9 recommendations.Surprise surprise!  One recommendation, of course, included deleting/erasing/censoring “disinformation” in the WHO’s eyes.But that’s just another “coincidence,” right?Man-Made Coronavirus Kills Hundreds (Bill Gates has a Vaccine for That)\n",

      "Is this the month (March 2020) when the world changed forever? Maybe future generations will never know this date as the time our civil liberties died and this coordinated move to supress humanity succeeded on a global scale. Who is going to fight this now? Thanks to the 24-hour news stream of information about the coronavirus “pandemic”, we are now seeing the submissive subtle introduction of a military medical state that has become the will of the people. Germ warfare would seem to be the victor. The people are now convinced. Prisons are over run, so your home has become a prison. With many of us living in built up urban areas, have we somehow willingly paid for our own asylum? First introduce the devil and then the angel (an untested vaccine) that protects you from the foe. It’s a phenomenal global chess move by the invisible elite.\n",
      "Humanity is out of control… Or was. Maybe this is where the curve changes. Either way, our world will probably never be the same again. For whilst everyone is locked up indoors, hiding from an invisible virus, division lines have already been drawn. The fight is already over before it began. We have now been made so wary of each other, no one talks face to face for fear of infection, families and friends have been separated as we “self isolate” and practice “social distancing.” No need for heavy handed crowd control when suspicion is made the norm. For there is a far subtler silent killer in our midst and no one is to be trusted. This globally simulated man made viral attack has ramped up over such a short period of time, that it has already led to what can only be seen as the beginning of the New World Order.Mass demonstrations are a thing of the past, as now we fear each other.Any organised protests against deploying new radiation emitting technology (call it 5G, call it whatever you want), digital ID chips and state enforced vaccines have been dealt with and crushed. The noise of information we are bombarded with has meant no one knows the truth anymore. Probably including this article. We now fear each other too much to even have a get together and a gossip, it’s all done via video links and remote access, we are being de-humanised, whilst the idea of gathering on the streets to protest is now widely accepted as a criminal act. Herd the people in, get them indoors, get them home and keep them scared. Change the financial model, with industry ground to a halt, its our livelihoods that are also now under threat. So introduce further control in the hope that it will return to us what we have lost. It shows just how flimsy our world is and how reliant we all are upon the system.As we now enter an age where you can be fined, or beaten for even going out onto the streets, whilst everyone agrees you probably “deserved it”. Mass electrification of our planet has in fact massively increased in the last 6 months. Radiation emitting satellites are already everywhere and soon they will be on every street corner. It’s no surprise that people will show more “flu-like symptoms” with this huge surge in radiation. So of course a virus pandemic makes for a perfect scape goat. We all carry radiation devices in our pockets. We wear it on our wrists, put it in our ears, we stare at it all day, sleep with it at night and use it to pay for everything we touch and eat. These are water de-structuring devices that alter our heart rates. We are electrical beings; we are made up of water and energy. All of this damage to our cells makes our bodies sick. The damaged cells build up in our sinuses and secrete as phlegm – it’s easy to mistake these as “flu-like symptoms.”Bear in mind also that the side effects of radiation is infertility and need we say more. The resulting increase in cancer will be kept as a mystery from the wider world and the slow down of the birth rate easily blamed on other factors, rather than the inevitable by-product of mass 5G technology. Add to this the vaccines and it becomes a cataclysm of a health catastrophe. Inject aluminium in people and they become electrical magnetic conductors. 5G towers are now being installed in schools and public places, while everyone stays at home, begging for a time when they can be released, get tested, get the vaccine and return to their old systemic way of life. It’s both evil and genius.But ultimately very scary. And guess what? It’s all about to become legally binding too, as 5G will become protected by law with this terrifying new legislation going through Congress, as we speak: S.893 – Secure 5G and Beyond Act of 2020 Passed on 3rd March. The purpose of which is to “develop a strategy to secure and protect U.S. fifth and future generations (5G) systems and infrastructure.” Such strategy shall ensure the security of 5G wireless communications systems and infrastructure within the United States; assist mutual defense treaty allies, strategic partners, and other countries in maximizing the security of 5G systems and infrastructure. This is about to become a law!The Microchip society. The ID2020 Alliance combines vaccines with implantable microchips to create your digital ID. In a Reddit Q&A, billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates revealed his plan to use ‘digital certificates’ to identify those who have been tested for COVID-19: Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates will launch human-implantable capsules that have ‘digital certificates’ which can show who has been tested for the coronavirus and who has been vaccinated against it. The 64 year old “tech mogul” and most powerful medical figure on the planet, revealed this yesterday during a Reddit ‘Ask Me Anything’ session while answering questions on the COVID-19 Coronavirus Pandemic. Gates was responding to a question on how businesses will be able to operate while maintaining social distancing, and said that, “Eventually we will have some digital certificates to show who has recovered or been tested recently or when we have a vaccine who has received it.” The ‘digital certificates’ Gates was referring to are human-implantable ‘QUANTUM-DOT TATTOOS’ that researchers at MIT and Rice University are working on as a way to hold vaccination records. It was last year in December when scientists from the two universities revealed that they were working on these quantum-dot tattoos after Bill Gates approached them about solving the problem of identifying those who have not been vaccinated. The quantum-dot tattoos involve applying dissolvable sugar-based microneedles that contain a vaccine and fluorescent copper-based ‘quantum dots’ embedded inside biocompatible, micron-scale capsules. After the microneedes dissolve under the skin, they leave the encapsulated quantum dots, whose patterns can be read to identify the vaccine that was administered. The quantum-dot tattoos will likely be supplemented with Bill Gates’ other undertaking called ID2020, which is an ambitious project by Microsoft to solve the problem of over 1 billion people who live without an officially recognized identity. ID2020 is solving this through digital identity. Currently, the most feasible way of implementing digital identity is either through smartphones or RFID microchip implants. The latter will be Gates’s likely approach not only because of feasibility and sustainability, but also because for over 6 years,the Gates Foundation has been funding another project that incorporates human-implantable microchip implants. This project, also spearheaded by MIT, is a birth control microchip implant that will allow women to control contraceptive hormones in their bodies. As for ID2020, to see it through, Microsoft has formed an alliance with four other companies, namely; Accenture, IDEO, Gavi, and the Rockefeller Foundation.\n",
      "The project is supported by the United Nations and has been incorporated into the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals initiative. But, on the other hand, this is Bill Gates’ perfect opportunity to see the projects through because as the coronavirus continues to spread and more people continue to die from the pandemic, the public at large is becoming more open to problem-solving technologies that will contain the spread of the virus. Last year in November, a Denmark-based tech company which had contracts to produce microchip implants for the Danish Government and the US Navy, had to cancel the launch of its supposedly “revolutionary” Internet-of-Things powered microchip implant after Christian activists attacked its offices in Copenhagen.Back in 2018 an article by Jay Greenberg, in Neon Nettle, described how Bill Gates had developed a new microchip, along with researchers at MIT, that will allow for adjustments to be made to a person’s hormone levels via remote control, in a bid to reduce the planet’s population.The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has been working in conjunction with a small Massachusetts startup to develop the “digital pill” that will enable women’s fertility to be switched on or off, remotely, with the touch of a button.The new “digital version of the contraceptive” pill will be tested in Africa this year where the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has spent years developing vaccination and family planning programs.Following testing, the microchips are due to be rolled out globally in 2018 with “every woman in America” replacing their regular contraceptive pill with the new remote-controlled chips, according to Gates.According to Forbes:A TED Talk by Gates from 2015 recently emerged called “The Next Outbreak? We’re Not Ready,” given during the Ebola epidemic, but as the White House administration faces criticism for not reacting quick enough, Gates reiterated that, “We did know it would happen at some point, either with a flu or some other respiratory virus…There was almost no funding.”Following the eventual end of the pandemic, Gates hopes that countries can work together to better prepare for similar situations, including the “need to have the ability to scale up diagnostics, drugs and vaccines very rapidly…the technologies exist to do this well if the right investments are made”; the $100 million his and his wife Melinda’s Gates Foundation donated to fight the coronavirus is focused on those three areas.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, this week said that mass production of a vaccine would likely not occur for another 12-18 months, and Gates concurred, saying that lots of manufacturing will need to be built to provide “billions of vaccines to protect the world” and that the first vaccines, which would “go to healthcare workers and critical workers…could happen before 18 months if everything goes well, but we and Fauci and others are being careful not to promise this when we are not sure.”Gates called for a “national tracking system similar to South Korea, saying that “in Seattle, the [University of Washington] is providing thousands of tests per day but no one is connected to a national tracking system” and that “Whenever there is a positive test it should be seen to understand where the disease is and whether we need to strengthen the social distancing.”\n",
      "He also stated: “My retiring from public boards was not related to the epidemic but it does reinforce my decision to focus on the work of the foundation including it’s work to help with the epidemic.” So fast forward to now and watch this video as this unnamed man announces the microchip vaccine. He says: “The military are in place… With mandated vaccines in the State of Oklahoma to vaccinate everyone in that state, there will be “no free travel without proof that certain levels of the population have the vaccines.” With plans that include road blocks and blockades to hold people that prove they have the vaccine.Metal bracelets that contain the chip, with your information.\n",
      "“They either kill you with the injection, or you refuse to take it… get taken away and be incarcerated.”I’m sure we have all seen law enforcement brutality across the world now, as in this video today in Ecuador, the man is beaten with batons and told to say he will not go out on the streets again, another scape goat to show the civilians what happens if you break the curfew.Now also watch this video from a Secret Service personnel, who spells it out. Stating: “No matter if you have a flu like symptom, do not take any vaccines… If you take the vaccine, the corona virus is in the vaccine. We are in the middle of a revolution. This is an Intelligence Operation. It began in 2011 to over throw this government and to stop many things happening around the world. Implement a Pandemic that would panic the world… Get people sick. They set off 5G in the area which set off flu like Symptoms where they were given the Corona Virus vaccines, so that they died in the street with the cameras ready. So you could see it…. Even celebrities were claimed to have the virus. They were simply used as a set up. Tom Hanks did not get the Corona Virus.The Coronavirus Bill in the UK.

Forced detention and isolation can be of anyone, including children, and for any amount of time. Authorities can FORCEABLY take biological samples from your body. There’s no clear access to legal rights from as-yet unidentified isolation facilities. Powers last up to 2.5 years Lockdown powers could prevent protests against measures. State surveillance safeguards weakened. Protections from forced detainment and treatment under Mental Health Act lowered. Cremations can be enforced against personal and religious wishes. Changes to the court system. Registration of deaths. No inquests into suspicious deaths! No requirement for any medical certification for burials or cremations! It also indemnifies the health service should they fail for what ever reason to provide care. The most frightening part.

      "Dr. Francis Boyle is perhaps best known for authoring the Biological Weapons Act. In an explosive interview with Geopolitics and Empire, shown below, Dr. Boyle reveals that the coronavirus now circulating in the wild, exploding as a pandemic, is indeed an “offensive biological warfare weapon.”In this eye-opening interview, probably soon to be banned by YouTube, Dr. Boyle plainly confirms exactly what Natural News has been reporting for over a week now: that the coronavirus is a biological weapon system which escaped the Wuhan BSL-4 laboratory and broke containment in the local population, spreading uncontrollably.In his own words, he says, “the coronavirus that we’re dealing with here is an offensive biological warfare weapon that leaked out of that Wuhan BSL-4 .”This further confirms the proof that the coronavirus was genetically engineered using the pShuttle vector tool that’s commonly known and used by virology researchers. It also ties into the fact that independent genomics researchers have also confirmed the coronavirus has been subjected to SARS gene insertions as part of the weaponization program.The mounting evidence of a laboratory origin is now irrefutable, yet the WHO is covering for China’s bioweapons program and trying to lie to the world about the origins of the virus, falsely claiming it came about from random permutations in the wild.Here’s more of the transcript from the interview with Dr. Boyle, which was originally posted on the Geopolitics & Empire channel on YouTube.Dr. Francis Boyle:It does seem to me that the Wuhan BSL-4 is the source of the coronavirus, yes. My guess is that they were researching SARS, and they weaponized it further by giving it gain-of-function properties, which means it could be more lethal, and indeed the latest report now is it’s 15% fatality rate which is more than SARS, and 83% infection rate. So a typical gain-of-function is it travels in the air, so it could reach out maybe six feet or more from someone emitting a sneeze or a cough. Likewise, this is a specially designated WHO research lab, so the WHO is in on it, and they knew full well what was going on there.Yes, it’s also reported the Chinese stole coronavirus materials from the Canadian lab at Winnipeg; Winnipeg is Canada’s foremost center for research developing and testing biological warfare weapons. It’s along the lines of Ft. Detrick in the USA, and yeah, I have three degrees from Harvard, it would not surprise me if something was being stolen out of Harvard to turn over to China… the bottom line is, …and I drafted the U.S. domestic implementing legislation for the biological weapons convention, that was approved unanimously by both houses of the U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Bush, Senior, that it appears the coronavirus that we’re dealing with here is an offensive biological warfare weapon that leaked out of that Wuhan BSL-4 [lab]. I’m not saying it was done deliberately, but there have been previous reports of problems with that lab and things leaking out of it, and I’m afraid that is what we are dealing with today.

Chi Haotian explained a long-range plan for ensuring a Chinese national renaissance,” reports Great Game India:“We are not as foolish as to want to perish together with America by using nuclear weapons,” said the general. “Only by using non-destructive weapons that can kill many people will we be able to reserve America for ourselves.” The answer is found in biological weapons. “Of course,” he added, “we have not been idle, in the past years we have seized the opportunity to master weapons of this kind.”“In the long run,” said Gen. Chi, “the relationship of China and the United States is one of a life-and-death struggle.” This tragic situation must be accepted. According to Gen. Chi, “We must not forget that the history of our civilization repeatedly has taught us that one mountain does not allow two tigers to live together.”According to Gen. Chi, China’s overpopulation problem and environmental degradation will eventually result in social collapse and civil war. General Chi estimated that “more than 800 million” Chinese would die in such a collapse. Therefore, the Chinese Communist Party has no policy alternative.Either the United States is “cleaned up” by biological attacks, or China suffers national catastrophe.In other words, China has been building a biological weapon to destroy the United States, and that weapon got loose in their own back yard. Now, it looks like China may have just nuked itself with that very same bioweapon, and the fate of China’s population, industrial output and political leadership looks very much in doubt.Perhaps it’s fitting that the coronavirus may be the vector by which China destroys itself before its treacherous philosophy of communism, tyranny and mass death infects the entire world.Read more news about biological weapons at BiologicalWeapons.news.In explosive interview, author of Bioweapons Act Dr. Francis Boyle confirms coronavirus is an “offensive biological warfare weapon”\n",

      "On March 18, outspoken eugenicist Bill Gates participated in an “Ask Me Anything” (AMA) event on Reddit entitled, “I’m Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. AMA about COVID-19.” And during this event, Gates openly admitted to the world that the agenda moving forward is to vaccinate every person on the planet with coronavirus vaccines as well as track them with Mark of the Beast-type “digital certificates.”Taking place just five days after he conveniently stepped down from the public board of Microsoft to “dedicate more time to philanthropic priorities including global health and development, education, and climate change,” this AMA event with Bill Gates ended up revealing the blueprints of the globalist endgame for humanity, which includes tagging people like cattle and controlling what they’re allowed to do based on their vaccination status.If you agree to get vaccinated with a Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine once it. becomes available, in other words, then the government will grant you permission to join back up with society and resume at least some of the “normalcy” of your former life. If you don’t, however, then you’ll presumably be ostracized from the rest of the world and forced into permanent isolation, left to fend for yourself with no means to buy, sell, or conduct any type of business in order to make a living and survive.This is the book of Revelation in action, and Bill Gates is laying it all out for you – assuming you’re paying attention. Everything he’s presenting as the “solution” to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis was foretold long ago by the prophets, and now it’s coming to fruition under the guise of stopping a global pandemic and ensuring that everyone has a proper “digital identity.”It was October 2019 when Bill Gates held his infamous Event 201 forum, which included discussions about a “hypothetical” coronavirus pandemic and how to handle it. Fast-forward a few months and here we are, exactly as Bill Gates and his globalist cronies “predicted” – or rather planned – it all to happen, along with their “solutions” waiting in the wings for a grand unveiling.When asked, “What changes are we going to have to make to how businesses operate to maintain our economy while providing social distancing?” Bill Gates responded:“The question of which businesses should keep going is tricky. Certainly food supply and the health system. We still need water, electricity and the internet. Supply chains for critical things need to be maintained. Countries are still figuring out what to keep running.”And here’s the real kicker at the conclusion of his answer:“Eventually we will have some digital certificates to show who has recovered or been tested recently or when we have a vaccine, who has received it.”Did you catch that? Bill Gates wants to digitally track everyone who contracts the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) and recovers from it, along with everyone who’s been tested for it. He also wants to know who takes the coronavirus vaccine once it becomes publicly available.Listen below to The Health Ranger Report as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, talks about how the world economy has now come to an end due to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19):Bill Gates wants everyone to have a “quantum dot tattoo” microchip inserted in their bodies\n",
      "It should be noted that the number-one up-voted response to this admission by Bill Gates was from a user who pointed out that it directly aligns with Revelation 13, which states, beginning in verse 16, concerning the Mark of the Beast:“He causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark of the name of the beast, or the number of his name. Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number is 666.”Keep in mind that this all coincides with the ID2020 agenda, which aims to create a global digital identification system for every person on Earth. As we’ve reported in the past, ID2020 and vaccines are being used together to harvest the biometric identities of all mankind, and all for the purpose of creating the global system of tracking and control that was foretold in the book of Revelation.They’ve already begun to test ID2020 in Bangladesh, inserting digital IDs in the bodies of newborn babies along with their vaccinations. And Bill Gates is now talking about how so-called “quantum dot tattoos” are the next wave of biometrics identification, also to be inserted in people’s bodies through vaccination.A report from Futurism explains the quantum dot tattoo as “tiny semiconducting crystals that reflect light” and that “glows under infrared light.” This pattern, along with the vaccine it’s hidden in, gets “delivered into the skin using hi-tech dissolvable microneedles made of a mixture of polymers and sugar,” and is coming to a vaccine clinic near you in the very near future.“This short (and unexpected answer) opened a gigantic Pandora’s box of what could be in store in the near future: The inevitable mass vaccination campaign to eradicate COVID-19 would be the perfect opportunity to introduce a worldwide digital ID,” warns Vigilant Citizen.To keep up with the latest Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) news, be sure to check out Pandemic.news.No vaccine, no job: Eugenicist Bill Gates demands “digital certificates” to prove coronavirus vaccination status\n",

      "“I am not saying that China deliberately released this, shooting itself in the foot. But it was clear they were developing an extremely dangerous unknown biological weapon that had never been seen before, and it leaked out of the lab… I personally believe that until our political leaders come clean with the American people, both at the White House and in Congress and our state government, and publicly admit that this is an extremely dangerous offensive biological warfare weapon that we are dealing with, I do not see that we will be able to confront it and to stop it, let alone defeat it.” —Dr. Francis Boyle, International Bioweapons Expert, April 15, 2020.According to Johns Hopkins University, as of today, COVID-19 has infected more than 3 million people and killed at least 210000 worldwide.Those are big numbers, considering the fact that six short months ago, few members of the general public had ever heard of the coronavirus. And almost no one was harboring fears of a looming and deadly global pandemic.But here we are. As our new reality sinks in, as we adjust to lockdowns and home schooling and long lines at grocery stores, as we look for ways to protect ourselves and our families—and as some grieve for lost loved ones—most of us are also seeking answers.Why does this virus cause so many mysterious symptoms? Why are some cases mild, others deadly? How can we protect ourselves? Whose advice should we follow?But the biggest questions of all are these: Where did COVID-19 come from? And how can we prevent this from ever happening again?The answers to these questions may be too disturbing to ponder, especially while we’re still grappling with the impact of the virus on nearly every aspect of our lives.But our failure to investigate, and directly address, the origins of COVID-19 almost certainly guarantees our failure to protect ourselves from future, possibly even more deadly, pandemics.Science most foul.Thousands of dangerous viruses and other pathogens, such as the bat coronavirus and the avian flu, are being collected in the wild by Chinese, U.S. and international researchers. These viruses are then analyzed and weaponized (i.e. genetically engineered, manipulated, recombined) in secretive, accident-prone, labs like the Wuhan Virology Lab in China or the U.S. Army Lab in Fort Detrick, Maryland.Coronaviruses typically have a narrow host range, infecting one or just a few species, such as bats. However, using targeted RNA recombination, gene engineers can manipulate viruses such as COVID-19 for “gain of function” to enable them to infect other species (i.e. human cells), interfere with immune system response and readily spread through the air.A growing arsenal of synthetic viruses have been lab-engineered, despite U.S. and international laws banning biowarfare weapons and experimentation. A disturbing number of these so-called “dual use” Biowarfare/Biodefense labs have experienced leaks, accidents and thefts over the past three decades\n",
      "As the well-respected Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists recently warned “A safety breach at a Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention lab is believed to have caused four suspected SARS cases, including one death, in Beijing in 2004. A similar accident caused 65 lab workers of Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute to be infected with brucellosis in December 2019 . . . In January 2020, a renowned Chinese scientist, Li Ning, was sentenced to 12 years in prison for selling experimental animals to local markets.”China is hardly the only place to experience such accidents. A USA Today investigation in 2016, for instance, revealed an incident involving cascading equipment failures in a decontamination chamber as U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) researchers tried to leave a biosafety level 4 lab. The lab likely stored samples of the viruses causing Ebola and smallpox, according to the report.In 2014, the CDC revealed that staff had accidently sent live anthrax between laboratories, exposing 84 workers. In an investigation, officials found other mishaps that had occurred in the preceding decade.In 2019, the U.S. Army Fort Detrick, Maryland Biological Weapons Lab was temporarily shut down for improper disposal of dangerous pathogens, according to a New York Times report. Officials refused to provide details about the pathogens or the leak, citing “national security” concerns.As Sam Husseini recently reported in Salon magazine, biowarfare engineers in labs such as Wuhan or Fort Detrick are deliberately and recklessly evading international law:“Governments that participate in such biological weapon research generally distinguish between ‘biowarfare’ and ‘biodefense,’ as if to paint such ‘defense’ programs as necessary. But this is rhetorical sleight-of-hand; the two concepts are largely indistinguishable. ‘Biodefense’ implies tacit biowarfare, breeding more dangerous pathogens for the alleged purpose of finding a way to fight them. While this work appears to have succeeded in creating deadly and infectious agents, including deadlier flu strains, such ‘defense’ research is impotent in its ability to defend us from this pandemic.”Activist critics of genetic engineering and biological warfare experiments, including myself, Dr. Mercola and GM Watch, joined now by independent voices in the mass media, are reporting, albeit in some cases reluctantly, that mounting evidence indicates that the deadly COVID-19 virus may have accidentally leaked out of one of the supposedly high-security biowarfare labs (the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the Chinese Center for Disease Control) that were analyzing and manipulating bat coronaviruses in Wuhan, China.In order to conceal their scientific malpractice and criminal negligence, to protect their “right” to carry out dangerous, unregulated research, and to safeguard billions of dollars in annual Biopharm and GMO industry profits (Monsanto/Bayer, among others, is now conducting its own biowarfare research), Chinese and U.S. officials, Big Pharma, Facebook, Google and an arrogant and unscrupulous network of global scientists are frantically trying to cover up the lab origins and diabolical machinations of the COVID-19 pandemic.A widely-cited paper, published in the journal Nature on February 3, 2020, claims to establish that SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus of bat origin that naturally jumped the species barrier between bats and humans and was not synthetically constructed in a lab. However, as Mercola.com reports one of the Chinese authors of this article, Dr. Shi Zhengli from the Wuhan Virology Lab, actually worked previously on weaponizing the SARS virus (the progenitor of COVID-19) and has published peer-reviewed articles on the procedures involved in this genetic manipulation.Another oft-cited but problematic article in Nature Medicine (March 17, 2020), co-authored by a bio-entrepreneur industry scientist, has been repeatedly cited by the mass media as offering “proof” that the COVID-19 virus arose “naturally” as opposed to being lab-derived.But recent critiques offered by independent scientists, including the London-based molecular geneticist Dr. Michael Antoniou, a long-time critic of genetic engineering, argue convincingly that the computer-modeling “proof” cited by Nature Medicine offers no proof at all. As GM Watch reports:“Dr. Antoniou told us that while the authors [of the March 17 Nature Medicine article] did indeed show that SARS-CoV-2 was unlikely to have been built by deliberate genetic engineering from a previously used virus backbone, that’s not the only way of constructing a virus. There is another method by which an enhanced-infectivity virus can be engineered in the lab. . .”Antoniou told GM Watch that this method, called “directed iterative evolutionary selection process,” involves using genetic engineering to generate “a large number of randomly mutated versions of the SARS-CoV spike protein receptor,” and then to select those protein receptors most effective at infecting human cells.\n",
      "As Antoniou points out, the inventors of this technique received the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 2018, a fact the authors of the Nature Medicine article surely knew. Did the authors of the Nature Medicine article deliberately leave this more plausible hypothesis out, in order to bolster their questionable thesis that COVID-19 arose naturally—even though biowarfare labs in Wuhan were engineering bat viruses years before the fatal outbreak?If lab technicians in the Wuhan lab did use the directed iterative evolutionary selection process to engineer a “gain of function” (weaponized) bat coronavirus, and the virus subsequently leaked, infected one or more lab technicians, then spread to people outside the lab, including people from the Wuhan Seafood Market, there would be no trace of the virus having been genetically engineered or manipulated.Peer-reviewed, published articles, going back more than a decade, indicate that researchers at the Wuhan Labs (Dr. Shi Zhengli and others) have been carrying out experiments to manipulate and weaponize deadly bat coronavirus so that they can readily infect human cells. In a 2008 article in the Journal of Virology, Zengli and other scientists report on how they have genetically engineered SARS-like viruses from horseshoe bats to enable the viruses to gain entry into human cells.\n",
      "The powers that be, in Beijing and Washington, like to reassure us that researchers in places like the Wuhan Virology Lab, the Wuhan Center for Disease Control, or the U.S. Army Biological Weapons Lab at Fort Detrick, Maryland are only “studying” (not manipulating or weaponizing) dangerous pathogens like bat coronaviruses, and that security in these government/WHO/NIH-monitored labs is so strict that accidents could never happen.But a number of well-respected scientific critics of genetic engineering and biological warfare have been sounding the alarm for decades.Critics including Francis Boyle (author of the 1989 U.S. Bioterrorism law banning bioweapons research) and Dr. Richard Ebright of Rutgers University’s Waksman Institute of Microbiology, have warned that experiments and manipulations of viruses and pathogens are inherently extremely dangerous, (not to mention that they violate international law), given human error and the fact that security has been dangerously lax in the world’s biowarfare/biodefense laboratories.\n",
      "Almost too incredible to believe, funding for the reckless germ war experiments in Wuhan have included more than $3 million from Dr. Anthony Fauci’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), a division of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), with apparent collaboration, according to Boyle, from scientists at the universities of North Carolina, Wisconsin, Harvard and other institutions.In 2014, the Obama White House Office of Science and Technology Policy put a hold or “funding pause” on “gain of function” experimentation on dangerous viruses in U.S. labs due to “biosafety and biosecurity risks.”Yet experimentation apparently continued uninterrupted (with U.S. funding) in China at the Wuhan lab. Then in 2017, the Trump Administration reversed this “funding pause,” essentially allowing illegal germ warfare research to continue.Longtime anti-GMO activists at GM Watch in the UK recently published an article entitled “COVID-19 Could Be a Wake-Up Call for Biosafety.” The article explains how, below the public radar, secretive and reckless research on genetically engineering and weaponizing coronaviruses has been going on for decades:“Stuart Newman, professor of cell biology and anatomy at New York Medical College in Valhalla, New York, editor-in-chief of the journal Biological Theory, and co-author of Biotech Juggernaut, adds crucial historical context that shows exploring whether COVID-19 could have been genetically engineered should not be dismissed as a subject fit only for conspiracy theorists.“[Newman] points out that the genetic engineering of coronaviruses has been going on for a long time. According to Newman, ‘Even most biologists are not aware that virologists have been experimentally recombining and genetically modifying coronaviruses for more than a decade to study their mechanisms of pathogenicity.’ Indeed, Newman points to papers on engineering coronaviruses that go back a full 20 years.” Dr. Peter Breggin points out that in 2015, researchers from the U.S. and China's Wuhan Institute of Virology collaborated to transform an animal coronavirus into one that can attack humans. Breggin’s provocative essay includes a direct link to the original study  which was published in the British journal, Nature.Recent investigative reporting, including an explosive April 14 Washington Post article by Josh Rogin, followed by more muted coverage by CBS News, CNN, the Wall Street Journal, Newsweek and others, have alerted millions of people to the fact that the official Chinese/Big Pharma/WHO/NIH “bat in the market” story about the origins of COVID-19 may no longer be credible.As Rogin’s article points out, officials from the U.S. embassy in Beijing visited the Wuhan Institute of Virology numerous times in early 2018, and tried to warn the Trump Administration that there were serious safety violations in the lab’s handling of bat coronaviruses. The officials were especially concerned that inadequately trained staff and lax security procedures at the lab, jointly funded by the Chinese and U.S., posed a serious risk of unleashing a “new SARS-like pandemic.”\n",
      "In fact, in 2004, foreshadowing the current disaster, there were two serious accidents at the high-security Beijing Virology lab, infecting two researchers with the dangerous SARS virus.Ebright, who has been speaking out on lab safety since the early 2000s, said this about the dangerous security procedures at the Wuhan labs:“bat coronaviruses at Wuhan [Center for Disease Control] and Wuhan Institute of Virology routinely were collected and studied at BSL-2 {Biosecurity Level 2), which provides only minimal protections against infection of lab workers. Virus collection, culture, isolation, or animal infection at BSL-2 with a virus having the transmission characteristics of the outbreak virus would pose substantial risk of infection of a lab worker, and from the lab worker, the public.”Politics most foul.The Trump Administration did nothing about the repeated warnings from the U.S. Embassy in Beijing in 2018, concerning the dangerous practices at the at the Wuhan Lab. Nor scientists at the NIH and the World Health Organization (WHO) who were supposedly monitoring the lab’s coronavirus experiments. After the outbreak happened, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) silenced or “disappeared” scientists and journalists who had earlier published research or news articles indicating that the COVID-19 virus leaked from a government lab and infected researchers.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the Canadian journalist Andrew Nikiforuk wrote:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Faced with the coronavirus threat, Chinese authorities, according to comprehensive reports by the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times, suppressed whistleblowers, ignored critical evidence and responded so tardily to the outbreak that they moved to compensate for their failures with a draconian lockdown . . .”.\n",
      "Frantically covering their tracks, the CCP removed every scientific article and news report from the internet and public record which contradicted their official story. Aiding and abetting the CCP/Biopharm cover-up were the gatekeepers at Facebook (now heavily invested in Big Pharma), who censored and removed an article by Steve Mosher, published by the NY Post on Feb. 22, which called the official story into question. Facebook finally unblocked the NY Post article after it was revealed that Facebook’s objective “fact checker,” Danielle E. Anderson, was in fact previously a paid researcher at the same Wuhan lab whose lax security so alarmed State Department officials.Trying hard to cover up the fact that they ignored the repeated warnings of the State Department and intelligence officials, the Trump Administration and the entire U.S. Biopharm and Vaccine Establishment are doing their utmost to uphold the official Chinese-scripted story. Especially troubling to the powers that be is the fact that the criminally negligent Wuhan Lab bat experiments were being funded, at least in part, by Dr. Fauci’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, along with the Galveston National Laboratory at the University of Texas Medical Branch—even after these types of germ warfare experiments had been banned in the U.S.Commander-in-Chief Trump himself, in between suggesting people might want to ingest or inject some disinfectants for COVID-19 protection, goes back and forth on the “bat in the market” theory, torn between rousing his populist base by denouncing the “Chinese Virus,” and siding with his good friend, and Corporate America’s most important business partner, Xi Jinping, the Chinese Dictator, who just happens to control not only trillions of dollars in U.S. Treasury Bonds and exports, but the medical equipment, Pharma drugs and lab chemicals that are in such short supply in the U.S.Trump also has millions of dollars in real estate loans coming due from Chinese banks next year.In an Instagram post, Robert Kennedy Jr. exposes the complicity of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the supposed “rational voice” of the Trump Administration on COVID-19, in the Wuhan disaster:“The Daily Mail today reports that it has uncovered documents showing that Anthony Fauci’s NIAID gave $3.7 million to scientists at the Wuhan Lab at the center of Coronavirus leak scrutiny. According to the British paper, ‘the federal grant funded experiments on bats from the caves where the virus is believed to have originated.’ Background: following the 2002-2003 SARS coronavirus outbreak, NIH funded a collaboration by Chinese scientists, U.S. military virologists from the bioweapons lab at Ft. Detrick & NIH scientists from NIAID to prevent future coronavirus outbreaks by studying the evolution of virulent strains from bats in human tissues. Those efforts included ‘gain of function’ research that used a process called ‘accelerated evolution’ to create COVID Pandemic superbugs: enhanced bat borne COVID mutants more lethal and more transmissible than wild COVID. Fauci’s studies alarmed scientists around the globe who complained, according a Dec. 2017 NY Times article that ‘these researchers risk creating a monster germ that could escape the lab and seed a pandemic.’ Dr. Mark Lipsitch of the Harvard School of Public Health’s Communicable Disease Center told the Times that Dr. Fauci’s NIAID experiments ‘have given us some modest scientific knowledge and done almost nothing to improve our preparedness for pandemic, and yet risked creating an accidental pandemic.’ In October 2014, following a series of federal laboratory mishaps that narrowly missed releasing these deadly engineered viruses, President Obama ordered the halt to all federal funding for Fauci’s dangerous experiments. It now appears that Dr. Fauci may have dodged the federal restrictions by shifting the research to the military lab in Wuhan. Congress needs to launch an investigation of NIAD’s mischief in China.”Kennedy also calls out two of the other supposed “health experts” on the Trump team, Robert Redfield and Deborah Birx:“Redfield, Birx & Fauci lead the White House #coronavirus task force. In 1992, two military investigators charged Redfield & Birx with engaging in ‘a systematic pattern of data manipulation, inappropriate statistical analyses & misleading data presentation in an apparent attempt to promote the usefulness of the GP160 AIDS vaccine.’ A subsequent Air Force tribunal on Scientific Fraud and Misconduct agreed that Redfield’s ‘misleading or, possibly, deceptive’ information ‘seriously threatens his credibility as a researcher and has the potential to negatively impact AIDS research funding for military institutions as a whole. His allegedly unethical behavior creates false hope and could result in premature deployment of the vaccine.’ The tribunal recommended investigation by a ‘fully independent outside investigative body.’ Dr. Redfield confessed to D.O.D. interrogators and to the tribunal, that his analyses were faulty and deceptive. He agreed to publicly correct them. Afterward, he continued making his false claims at 3 subsequent international HIV conferences, & perjured himself in testimony before Congress, swearing that his vaccine cured HIV. Their gambit worked. Based upon his testimony, Congress appropriated $20 million to the military to support Redfield/Birx’s research project.  Public Citizen complained in a 1994 letter to the Congressional Committee’s Henry Waxman that the money caused the Army to kill the investigation & ‘whitewash’ Redfield’s crimes. The fraud propelled Birx & Redfield into stellar careers as health officials. Docs obtained via Tom Paine.\" Although the Chinese government and most of the U.S. political establishment continue to support the official “bat in the market” story, the majority of Americans, do not. As reported in the UK’s Sunday Times:“According to a Pew Research poll, only 43 percent think the virus came about naturally, while a sizeable 29 percent  believe it was made in a laboratory.” Journalism most foul. It is frustrating, and indeed alarming, that so few independent journalists, scientists, activists, and public officials have thus far been willing to question the “official story.”For 30 years now, myself and others have warned about the dangers of genetically engineered foods and crops and genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in general, including gene-altered bioweapons, gene drives, and the new CRISPR gene-editing technologies.Now it appears that our worst fears have materialized.We need a global public inquiry, led by independent scientists, to gather the evidence on what really happened with COVID-19, followed by an International Biowarfare Crimes Tribunal, so that we can bring the Chinese, U.S. and other perpetrators of this pandemic to justice, and prevent this type of disaster from ever happening again.It’s time to shut down every Biosafety/Biowar lab in the world (including Bayer and Monsanto’s lab) and implement a true global ban on weapons of mass destruction (WMDs), including all atomic, chemical and biological weapons and WMD experimentation.Until we do this, none of us will ever be safe again.The so-called progressive media in America, with a few exceptions, have up until now failed to investigate the real causes of the COVID-19 pandemic, partly out of ignorance of the machinations and arrogant recklessness of the gene engineers and bio-warfare scientists, partly out of fear of appearing to agree with Trump’s racist rantings, or even worse, being branded a “conspiracy theorist” by Establishment Democrats and mass media outlets.And speaking of conspiracies and murder most foul, almost everyone seems to have forgotten about the nationwide panic surrounding the post-9/11 2001 anthrax bioterrorist attacks—used to help justify the invasion of Iraq—against liberal members of the media and the U.S. Congress. Then and now, it was clear that these attacks were carried out not by Arab terrorists, nor a single crazed individual, but by a yet unidentified cabal who engineered and deployed weaponized spores from the U.S. military biowarfare lab at Fort Detrick, Maryland.But perhaps you think we shouldn’t worry so much, since a blockbuster lineup of anti-COVID vaccines are on the way, funded by the Chinese government, Big Pharma and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, likely including some of the same gene engineers who weaponized COVID-19?Never mind that Bill Gates, Monsanto, the Gene Giants and Big Pharma appear quite willing to join up with Facebook and Google to implement a 24/7 totalitarian medical surveillance state, with everyone injected with a mandatory and expensive COVID-19 vaccine, while the world’s dictators, corporate criminals and billionaires hunker down in their underground mansions and bunkers.Never mind that most flu vaccines up until now don’t work that well, especially against constantly mutating viruses like COVID-19, or that they’re routinely laced with aluminum adjuvants and mercury preservatives.Never mind that perhaps our only real defense against biowarfare is to stop eating Big Ag and Big Food’s poison products, and instead strengthen our health and our immune systems, clean up the world’s air, water and environment, shut down factory farms, stop destroying wildlife habitat and pray that herd immunity eventually stops the spread of COVID-19, since so many of us have already been infected, but are asymptomatic.In the meantime, please don’t believe everything you read in the corporate mass media, Facebook or even the progressive press. Stay in touch with and support those of us determined to seek and defend the truth, fight for freedom and justice, and organize for a regenerative future and climate.Don’t forget to eat healthy, organic, regenerative foods, take your immune-boosting supplements, get as much exercise, fresh air and sunshine as possible, wash your hands frequently, stay safe, and stay out of the way of those most vulnerable.Please sign our petition demanding an end to genetic engineering of viruses.Murder Most Foul: The Perps Behind COVID-19\n",

      "SARS-CoV-2 — A Biological Warfare Weapon. “Novel coronavirus” means it is a new virus not previously known to previously infect humans. The currently held conventional view is that SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted through animals (zoonotic transmission), specifically bats. Boyle dismissed this notion in our initial interview, and still refutes the idea. While a widely-cited paper,2 published in the Nature journal on February 3, 2020, claims to establish that SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus of bat origin that then jumped species, the work of one of the authors of that paper, Shi Zhengli, actually involved the weaponization of the SARS virus. (Another Nature paper3 published that same day reiterates the idea that the COVID-19 pandemic is zoonotically transmitted.) However, according to Boyle, other scientific literature establishes that this is indeed an engineered synthetic virus that was not transmitted from animals to humans without human intervention. For starters, a Lancet paper4 published February 15, 2020, by physicians who treated some of the first COVID-19 patients in China showed that patient zero, the one believed to have started the transmission, was nowhere near the Wuhan seafood market. What’s more, there were no bats sold in or even close to the market. At least one-third of the patients reviewed also had no exposure or links to that market. This data supports the counter-hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 was not zoonotically transmitted but is in fact an engineered virus. Even U.S. politicians and intelligence agencies are starting to say they believe the virus leaked from the Wuhan BSL4 lab.56 In our first interview, Boyle discussed published research establishing that the novel coronavirus is SARS, which is a weaponized version of the coronavirus to begin with Wuhan BSL 4 lab, with added gain-of-function capabilities that increases its virulence (makes it spread easier and faster). “I also went through the scientific article where the Australian health board working with Wuhan … genetically engineered HIV into SARS,” Boyle says. “So, that is all verified in scientific papers. In addition, it seems to me that they took that back to the [Wuhan] BSL4 and applied nanotechnology to it. The size of the molecules are maybe 120 microns, which indicates to me we are dealing with nanotechnology. That's [something] you need to do in a BSL4. Biological weapons nanotechnology is so dangerous, people working with it have to wear a moon suit with portable air. We also know that one of the cooperating institutions [to Wuhan BSL4] was Harvard, and that the chairman of the Harvard chemistry department, [Dr. Charles Lieber], a specialist in nanotechnology, set up an entire laboratory in Wuhan where [according to reports] he specialized in applying nanotechnology to chemistry and biology. My guess is, based on what I've read in the literature, that they tried to weaponize all that together. And that is SARS-CoV-2 that we are dealing with now. So, it's SARS, which is genetically engineered biowarfare agent to begin with. Second, it has gain-of-function properties, which makes it more lethal, more infectious. It has HIV in there. That was confirmed by an Indian scientist … and it looks like nanotechnology [has been used] … An MIT scientist who did a study found that it traveled 27 feet through the air. And that, I guess, was in lab conditions.That, I think, is why it's so infectious, and that is what I believe we are dealing with here … [This is] why the 6-foot [social distancing recommendation] by the CDC … is preposterous. Even doubling that will do you no good. If there is nanotechnology, it floats in the air. I am not saying that China deliberately released this, shooting itself in the foot. But it was clear they were developing an extremely dangerous unknown biological weapon that had never been seen before, and it leaked out of the lab.And as you see in the Washington Post,7 U.S. State Department officials … [reported] back to Washington that there were inadequate safety precautions and procedures in that lab to begin with. We also know that SARS has leaked out of other Chinese biological warfare labs. So right now, I believe that is what happened here. I personally believe that until our political leaders come clean with the American people, both at the White House and in Congress and our state government, and publicly admit that this is an extremely dangerous offensive biological warfare weapon that we are dealing with, I do not see that we will be able to confront it and to stop it, let alone defeat it.”Advertisement. Click here to learn more about Earth Day. The Origin of SARS-CoV-2. While Boyle made the origin of SARS-CoV-2 clear in our initial conversation, as I started reading some of the literature it really was shocking because one of the primary investigators on the 2015 paper8 from the University of North Carolina — “A SARS-like Cluster of Circulating Bat Coronaviruses Shows Potential for Human Emergence” — was Dr. Shi Zhengli, a virologist who in 2010 had published a paper9 discussing the weaponization of the SARS virus. Normally, while the coronavirus found in bats may be SARS,10 it typically does not infect humans as it does not target the ACE-2 receptor. The infectious agent causing the current pandemic is called SARS-CoV-2 — SARS standing for “serious acute respiratory infection” and CoV-2 indicating that it’s a second type of SARS coronavirus known to infect humans. SARS-CoV-2, of course, contains the genetic modification to attach to ACE2 receptors in human cells, which allows it to infect them. Zhengli’s publications show that she engineered this bat coronavirus into one that crosses species and infects humans. She has in fact been working on this for more than 10 years. “That is why I said SARS was a bioengineered warfare weapon to begin with,” Boyle says. “And that is what … [the University of] North Carolina and … the Australian lab were trying to make even more dangerous with the gain-of-function and the HIV. So … SARS was a biological warfare [agent] to begin with, it leaked, and that is the origin of the [COVID-19] epidemic.” In addition, an Indian paper1112 that ended up being withdrawn due to intense political pressure, shows a specific envelope protein from the HIV virus called GP41 was integrated in the RNA sequences of SARS-CoV-2. In other words, the implication is that the HIV virus was genetically engineered into SARS. So, in summary, SARS-CoV-2 appears to be a bioengineered bat coronavirus13 — which was initially benign and nontransmittable to humans. Zhengli then genetically modified the virus to integrate spike proteins that allows the virus to enter human cells by attaching to ACE-2 receptors. That was the first modification.\n",
      "The second modification was to integrate an envelope protein from HIV called GP141, which tends to impair the immune system. A third modification appears to involve nanotechnology to make the virus light enough to remain airborne for a long time, apparently giving it a range of up to 27 feet.14. Nanotech Expert With Wuhan Connection Arrested While the BSL4 lab in Wuhan may have leaked the virus, its creation does not appear to be limited to the Chinese. As noted by Boyle in his comment above, the chairman of the Harvard department of chemistry, nanoscience expert Dr. Charles Lieber, was arrested earlier this year by federal agencies, suspected of illegal dealings with China.15 Lieber has denied the allegations. The Wuhan University of Technology (WUT) allegedly paid him $50000 a month from 2012 to 2017 to help establish and oversee the WUT-Harvard Joint Nano Key Laboratory. He also received another $150000 a month in living expenses from China’s Thousand Talents program. The problem was, Harvard officials claim they had not approved the lab and didn’t know about it until 2015. Boyle comments: “The cover story here — that Harvard didn't know what was going on — is preposterous. I spent seven years at Harvard. I have three degrees from Harvard. I spent two years teaching at Harvard. Of course Harvard knew that its chair of the chemistry department had this lab in Wuhan, China, where he was working on nanotechnology with respect to chemical and biological materials. That's been reported. They didn't say what the materials were. In addition, it has now been reported that Harvard was a cooperating institution with the Wuhan BSL4.” Researchers Working on Gain-of-Function to Spanish Flu. If you think SARS-CoV-2 is bad, be glad it’s not the weaponized version of Spanish flu, which has also been in the works, according to Boyle. He says: “[The University of North Carolina’s] work was existentially dangerous and they knew it at the time. If you read the UNC scientific article16 [cowritten by] the Wuhan BSL4 scientist [Shi Zhengli] … it says, ‘Experiments with the full-length and chimeric SHC014 recombinant viruses were initiated and performed before the GOF research funding pause and have since been reviewed and approved for continued study by the NIH.’ It says recombinant … So, they admit it was gain-of-function [research]. [The research] was paused by NIH17 [National Institutes of Health]. Why was it paused by NIH? Because there was a letter put out by large numbers of life scientists at the time saying this type of gain-of-function work … could be existentially dangerous if it got out in the public. Therefore, it had to be terminated … [But] the NIH was funding this in the beginning. A footnote here: I read the NIH’s pause letter to the University of North Carolina, and UNC was doing two gain-of-function research projects. The other one was with Dr. [Yoshihiro] Kawaoka from the University of Wisconsin, who had resurrected the Spanish flu virus18 for the Pentagon. He, according to the pause letter, was also there doing gain-of-function work on the flu virus — one could only conclude it was the Spanish flu virus. It did not say the Spanish flu, but they also put a gain-of-function pause on that type of deadly research. I mean, the Spanish flu, we all know what that is, so imagine giving the Spanish flu gain-of-function properties, making it even more lethal and more infectious. That's exactly what was going on there at that UNC lab …” Disturbingly, while the NIH halted funding of this kind of gain-of-function research on lethal pathogens in 2014, it reauthorized it in December 201719 and Boyle suspects Kawaoka’s work may have been restarted as well, although he’s not found proof of it yet. “So, this was existentially dangerous work that was going on at that UNC lab. Everyone knew it, NIH funded it, NIAID under Dr. Fauci funded it as well. They knew exactly how dangerous this was. They paused it and then they resumed it,” Boyle says. Can Violations of Biowarfare Treaty Be Enforced? As mentioned, Boyle is a professor of international law and drafted an international treaty on biowarfare agents and weapons. That law is still in force, and would provide life imprisonment for everyone involved in the creation and release of SARS-CoV-2, were it officially concluded to be a biowarfare agent. “If you read that UNC article,20 it says exactly it was dealing with synthetic molecules … And in my biological weapons anti-terrorism act of 1989, I specifically criminalized — by that name — synthetic molecules. That is why, at first, the whole synthetic biology movement … was set up by the Pentagons DARPA. They funded the whole thing. And it's DARPA money that is behind synthetic biology, gene drive and all the rest of it. And that is why at the first convention of synthetic biologists, in their final report, one of their key recommendations was the repeal of my biological weapons anti-terrorism act, because they fully intended to use synthetic biology to manufacture biological weapons. The law still applies. It provides for life imprisonment for everyone who has done this … all the scientists involved at the University of North Carolina and everyone who funded this project, knowing that it was existentially dangerous — and that includes Fauci and [people at] the NIH … UNC, Food and Drug Administration … the Dana Harvard Cancer Institute at Harvard … the World Health Organization …”So, just how would we get that process of justice going? Boyle explains: “There are two ways. First, you're going to have to pressure the Department of Justice to prosecute these people. That might be very difficult to do. Federal statutes require indictments to be brought by U.S. attorneys. However, just with respect to North Carolina, state law applies there too. I haven't researched North Carolina law; however, I was originally hired here to teach criminal law and I taught it for seven or eight years. To have criminal intent, one of the variants of criminal intent is the demonstration of grave indifference to human life. And that is the criminal intent necessary for homicide. So in my opinion, and my advice would be, if we can't get [attorney general William Pelham] Barr to sign off on prosecuting these people, that the district attorney, state’s attorney, attorney general out there in North Carolina, institute and indict everyone involved in this North Carolina work for homicide. And that could include up to and including murder, malice of forethought. Again, one of the elements can be manifestation of grave indifference to human life. And it's clear from this article [the 2015 UNC paper21], they knew it was gain-of-function, they paused it because it was existentially dangerous, it was then reapproved and they continued it. So, I think a good case could be made, certainly, for indicting these people under North Carolina law by North Carolina legal authorities, if the federal government is not going to do it for us, under my law [the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989]. But again, I want to make it clear, I haven't research North Carolina law.”Time to Shutter All BSL4 Laboratories? Boyle is adamant that all BSL3 and BSL4 laboratories must be closed down and all biowarfare work with lethal pathogens ceased. “They are all existentially dangerous,” he says. “This is a catastrophe waiting to happen. And it is now happened. Here we are. It's staring us in the face.” Certainly, COVID-19 is nowhere near as devastating as the Black Death or the Spanish flu of 1918, both of which exacted a shocking death toll, all without the aid of synthetic molecules and nanotechnology. The very idea that any of these horrific illnesses might be brought back in turbo-charged form should be terrifying enough for the world to unite in saying “No thanks; we don’t want or need that kind of research going on.” What value have these dangerous laboratories provided to date compared to the risk they are exposing all of us to?In closing, while Boyle believes COVID-19 has the ability to become a serious pandemic killer, I strongly disagree. Based on all the data I’ve seen so far, I believe he’s wrong on this point, and I suspect the death toll due to economic hardship and emotional stress will be far worse than the disease itself.SARS-CoV-2 — A Biological Warfare Weapon?\n",

      "Is the Corona virus really just a global version of the children’s story “The Emperor’s New Clothes,” this year’s big threat to humanity that is destroying our freedom of choice and liberty? You are being lied to.They say America is the land of the free. What happened there?No need  for real life battles anymore when the corona virus can take care of the seismic power shift all on its own. This time the bad guy could be our next door neighbour.As the body of evidence mounts, we want to show you just some of the people coming forward to now question this mass global (pandemic) pandemonium that is CO-VID 19. Named in 2019 this is a rebrand of the flu. Problem with the Flu is that no one is scared of it anymore. Whilst the vaccine was proven so woeful in its attempts to stop it last year that the CDC had to admit it failed a whopping 91% of the time. So it needed a new name. A rebrand. Update: What if you found out that the Coronavirus is actually on the list of ingredients of the Flu shot? Therefore anyone that has had a Flu vaccine could test positive for Corona virus. It’s right here on the insert under side effects. Courtesy of Goy Brian Pearce who spotted this.Surely, it has gone too far now and the economic fall out to this “pandemic” far outweighs the shaky numbers and scientific “facts” we are being bombarded with by the centralised News corporations that are owned by the very same people that have a huge vested interest in their new untested vaccines. Fear is a terrible thing. It’s bad for your health and closes down large sections of independent cognitive function.Billions of people are now out of work thanks to a virus that has actually been around for years. As we reported on Wednesday this week, the introduction of 5G, Digital microchips and enforced vaccines are now going unchallenged thanks to the coronavirus and the 24-hour news stream of information about the coronavirus “pandemic.”We are now seeing something far more terrifying, the submissive subtle introduction of a military medical state that has been spun out to such a degree that is has now become the will of the people. It’s a very carefully laid out plan.Is this perhaps the precursor to these truly alarming numbers? Is Corona virus the excuse to introduce more vaccines and more radiation emitting technology that will make these figures a reality? Cancer is here to stay. Anyone remember Sadam Hussein and his fictitious “weapons of mass destruction” that became the justification for the invasion of Iraq? Each year there is a new virus, disease, or movement that suddenly and swiftly rears its head, sent from Satan himself, it’s here to threaten our way of life and kill us all. HIV, Swine flu, Bird flu, ISIS, whatever this common trending enemies name may be, we run in fear and wait for our governments help to come and fight the bad guy. Go get them guys! Many of the emergency measures that were put in place at these times and under the guise of terrorism paved the way for the emergency measures we are now seeing, that justify yet more laws being passed quickly and easily, circumnavigating the usually slow democratic process.After all, “Democracy” tends to muddy the waters if you want to centralise everything. Please see some of the following pieces of evidence now circling the globe that will make you see the Corona virus in a whole new, far less terrifying light than the one that is portrayed by state owned Television and their shiny made up graphics. Look at these 2 images below, spot the difference. How do we know the image below is in New York? This is actually a hospital in Italy.We are being constantly told what to think.We say enough is enough!Take a breath. We urge you to look at this story with some rationality and imagine for a second you did not own a TV and had perhaps been in a blissful coma for the last two months. You’d wake up as many probably do thinking the world had gone bonkers.Reflect on the fact that the CDC is in fact a vaccine company, owning the patent on 56 vaccines currently in existence, with a further 271 in the pipeline, whilst good old Bill Gates and his charades continue. The second richest (recorded) man on the planet has invested a lot of money in his ID chips and global vaccines and needs his return on investment.ID2020 is an ambitious project by Microsoft to solve the problem of over 1 billion people who live without an officially recognized identity. ID2020 is solving this through digital identity.He is also the most powerful man at the World Health Organisation. This is nothing more than global power play. Even if you read no further, please consider these facts:Is this a test to see how many will submit? Is this time that the tide turned and people took back some of their own free will? The real agenda that is being hurried through the corridors of power in every major industrial country RIGHT NOW is the creation of further centralised control amidst the erosion of your free will and independent basic human rights. The coronavirus statistics are blinding people to the reality and playing with peoples lives on a vast scale. London authorities caught in the act. Please watch this video where the authorities are called out for posting their panic filled propaganda in London. The irate lady had just fed a homeless man that was taken away. Then she gets a letter through her door saying the man had died of the Corona virus 2 hours ago. She is understandably livid.They even remove their masks once they are called out. Please now watch this video of virologists Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg, an expert in the field of viral study. Reminding us that the Corona virus is actually nothing new. It’s been around for years, whilst in actual fact the tests are mostly unsubstantiated and fabricated. The intro to the video stating: “The corona hype is not based on any extraordinary public health danger. However, it causes considerable damage to our freedom and personal rights through frivolous and unjustified quarantine measures and restrictions. The images in the media are frightening and the traffic in China’s cities seems to be regulated by the clinical thermometer. Evidence-based epidemiological assessment is drowning in the mainstream of fear mongers in labs, media, and ministries”. So if the tests are fake and wrong, what are we all so worried about? What is this huge distraction that has closed airports and meant the police patrol the streets?Please see this section for the many crimes against humanity that have been committed by the vaccine industry. Please also read this extract from Corona: the case number game by Jon Rappoport, on his website No More Fake News that highlights how crazy these numbers really are, given the size of the worlds population and what happens ALL THE TIME with airborn viruses:Starting with Europe and just plain flu. Not COV. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) Europe [1], “During the winter months, influenza may infect up to 20% of the population…” That’s ordinary seasonal flu. The population of Europe is 741 million people. This works out to 148 million cases of ordinary flu. Not once. Every year. EVERY YEAR.According to statista.com [2], “As of March 23, 2020, there have only been 170424 confirmed cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) across the whole of Europe since the first confirmed cases in France on January 25.” Let’s go to Italy. According to statista.com [3], “Italy has the highest amount of confirmed [COV] cases in Europe with 59138…” That’s as of March 23. If you multiply by six, to get the annual figure, you arrive at 360000 cases. You want to blow that up, because of acceleration? Go ahead. How about a million cases for the year? Two million. Three million… Now let’s look at ordinary flu cases for Italy in a given year. According to sciencedirect.com [4], “In the winter seasons from 2013/14 to 2016/17, an estimated average of 5290000 ILI [influenza-like illness] cases occurred in Italy, corresponding to an incidence of 9%.” That’s 5 million plus each year… Was a seasonal flu pandemic declared in Italy? Ever? Was the whole country ever locked down as a result? No.Finally, let’s look at figures for ordinary flu, for the whole planet. A study published in the journal, Pharmacy and Therapeutics [5], states, “Influenza is a highly contagious respiratory illness that is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. Approximately 9% of the world’s population is affected annually, with up to 1 billion infections, 3 to 5 million severe cases, and 300000 to 500000 deaths each year.”A BILLION cases EVERY YEAR. Is this called a pandemic? Is the whole world locked down every year? No.Please sign our petition against enforced vaccines and medical interventions. Now please read this extract from an article entitled; Liars, Liars, Stumps on Fire by Anna VonReitz. The CDC is a vaccine company. They are presenting “the CDC” as some big authority we all need to listen to. The CDC is a privately owned vaccine company and on the take for hundreds of millions of dollars from the men who promoted weaponization of the Common Cold. These despicable criminals set up this entire pandemic to profit themselves. Instead of being in position to control and manipulate our response to their handiwork. This is the same CDC that has just recently lost in a landmark court case that they simply cannot deny that vaccines cause Autism.And instead of being allowed to profit themselves…. They should be arrested, tried, and executed without any further adieu. It might not help their victims, but at least we would be rid of them. Its’ collaborators on this “project” — DARPA, the Pirbright Institute and Wellcome Trust and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation should all be similarly dismembered, liquidated, and their board members/trustees denied any protection of the corporate veil…They have planned this pandemic with malice aforethought and for profit. Thousands of people have already died because of these mass murderers.  We are being played Please watch this full exposé from Amazing Polly, who describes the various Corona virus lies that are happening right now in the USA.“I look in to the back ground of Debra Birx which leads us to PEPFAR, which leads us to Bono and Bill Gates and the swampy depths of the Frankenstein Medical Industrial Complex. It’s GLOBAL.”Some countries are resisting. But for how long? Some countries are saying no to the WHO and the CDC. But how long can they stand out against this enormous political pressure, even though the the numbers don’t stack up every other country is falling in line so why are they not? Mexico parties on.  The Mexicans are more used to not trusting their institutions. Maybe this could in fact help them out? Only time will tell. As Terry Tillaart states on Facebook: CAJONES! — SCREW YOU FAKE “VIRUS”! P.S. NOBODY was harmed by any “virus” at this event. It doesn’t take an ounce of Cajones to attend a large music festival, all it takes is enough common sense to know the media has NEVER told you the truth even 1 time in your life!.. It shouldn’t require any Cajones to share this with your friends either because there is absolutely nothing they can say in the face of this evidence that doesn’t makes an ounce of sense! It does, however, require SERIOUS CAJONES on the part of the Mexican President to buck the ENORMOUS pressure applied to all countries Globally from the Pharma & Banking Cartels to uphold this virus fakery and avoid EVIDENCE like this getting out proving everyone is just fine!!! HUGE applause to this new President and now we KNOW for a fact why we’ve never heard his name mentioned before and it’s because he is not playing ball with the cartels!Population of Greater Mexico City? 21581000 (Yes much larger than New York or LA)…..not shutdown and nobody is sick!!!! Meanwhile in Brazil supporters of the President are calling for mass protests against the imposed shut down. Accroding to NPR: Right-wing groups in Brazil are summoning their supporters onto the streets to demand that their country returns to work, and ends mass lockdowns imposed to reduce the spread of the coronavirus. This follows a highly controversial campaign against shutdowns by Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who believes mass closures will cause more economic devastation and suffering than the virus itself. On Thursday, the number of COVID-19 deaths in Brazil rose by 20 to 77 — the country’s biggest jump so far — while confirmed cases went up by 482 to 2915, according to Brazil’s Health Ministry. Even if these results were genuine reasons for death, that’s an absolute fraction in comparison to the size of Brazils population of over 212 million.According to the report:  Groups sympathetic to the president are circulating posts mainly on WhatsApp and Twitter, calling on people to leave their homes and join motorcades protesting the closure of nonessential businesses and schools that have brought life to a near standstill in some areas, including São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. “We are not going to die of hunger,” says one of the posts advertising a rally Friday. Another calls for the mobilization of business owners, store keepers, drivers for ride-hailing companies and others this weekend. Similar motorcade protests were also held on Thursday in several smaller cities, according Brazilian media reports.\n",
      "Bolsonaro has repeatedly dismissed the coronavirus threat as “exaggerated,” arguing that people over 60 are the at-risk group that should be isolated, but that most Brazilians suffer few or no symptoms and should continue to work.The Emperors new clothes. Once the rumour came from high enough in the pecking order, so the people became convinced that the naked Emperor was in fact fully clothed. They heard about these clothes from their friends and celebrities on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and even the 10 o’clock news, so it must be true. Fuelled by fear, their imaginations ran wild with images of resplendent clothes, for fear of looking stupid in front of their friends, or even worse, being beaten by the emperor’s thugs with sticks if they even dare to think of anything other than compliance and mass obedience. “Shhh kid, of course the emperors got clothes on, you don’t want to catch that terrible disease do you? Now get inside!” Screw that, lets listen to the children a bit more?! They are not as brain washed as us! So how do you protect yourself against any virus?Anyone with a healthy lifestyle, a clean diet and strong immune system should be well equipped to cope with any virus. But if you are concerned about your own immune system then please read MD Fermin’s informative and thought provoking article, stating that the medical world has much to gain from embracing Immunotherapy, such as  Genuine GcMaf. We all have GcMAF in our bodies, as it is a naturally occurring protein. The likelihood is that if you are well and healthy, you have enough of it to fight off virus’s and pathogens. If on the other hand you are sick, or have been diagnosed with a serious condition, then your immune system is low and so your GcMAF is too. The evidence, research and real stories that proves the effectiveness of Genuine Bulgarian GcMAF Immunotherapy, even against the rarest of cancers, is abundant. One of the issues is that it is not a well publicised story. According to Dr. Theron Hutton, MD, N-acetyl cysteine, selenium, spirulina, and high-dose glucosamine are all supplements of natural origin that have been scientifically shown to provide protection against RNA viruses like influenza and coronavirus.In a paper entitled, “Nutraceuticals have potential for boosting the type 1 interferon response to RNA viruses including influenza and coronavirus,” researchers from the Catalytic Longevity Foundation and the Mid America Heart Institute at St. Luke’s Hospital found that these and other herb extractions such as elderberry possess symptomatically beneficial properties that can help to mediate the impact of infections such as coronavirus, which is definitely worth considering.

      "On January 30th 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) in relation to China’s novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) categorized  as a viral pneumonia.  The virus outbreak was centred in  Wuhan, a city in Eastern China with a population in excess of 11 million.In the week prior to January 30th decision, the WHO Emergency Committee “expressed divergent views”. There were visible divisions within the Committee. On January 30th, a far-reaching decision was taken without the support of expert opinion at a time when the coronavirus outbreak was limited to Mainland China.\n",
      "There were 150 confirmed cases outside China, when the decision was taken. 6 in the United States, 3 in Canada, 2 in the UK, etc.150 confirmed cases over a population of 6.4 billion (World population of 7.8 billion minus China’s 1-4 billion).What was the risk of being infected? Virtually zero.The WHO did not act to reassure and inform World public opinion. Quite the opposite: A “Fear Pandemic” rather than a genuine Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)  was launched.Outright panic and uncertainty were sustained through a carefully designed media disinformation campaign.Almost immediately this led to economic dislocations, a crisis in trade and transportation with China affecting major airlines and shipping companies.  A hate campaign against ethnic Chinese in Western countries was launched, followed by the collapse in late February of stock markets, not to mention the crisis in the tourist industry resulting in countless bankruptcies.The complexity of this crisis and its impacts have to be addressed and carefully analysed.What we are dealing with is “economic warfare” supported by media disinformation, coupled with the deliberate intent by  the Trump administration to undermine China’s economy. The ongoing economic dislocations are not limited to China.There are important public health concerns which must be addressed. But what motivated the Director-General of the WHO to act in this way?  Who was behind this historic January 30th decision of the WHO’s Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Our subsequent  analysis (in the timeline below) reveals that powerful corporate interests linked to Big Pharma, Wall Street and agencies of the US government were instrumental in the WHO’s far-reaching decision.What is at stake is the alliance of “Big Pharma” and “Big Money”, with the endorsement of the Trump Administration. The decision to launch a fake pandemic under the helm of the WHO on January 30, was taken a week earlier at the Davos World Economic Forum (WEF). The media operation was there to spread outright panic.(Scroll down to Read our Timeline on how these events unfolded). But this was not the first time that the WHO decided to act in this way.Remember the unusual circumstances surrounding the April 2009 H1N1 Swine Flu Pandemic.An atmosphere of fear and intimidation prevailed. The data was manipulated.Based on incomplete and scanty data, the WHO Director General nonetheless predicted with authority that: “as many as 2 billion people could become infected over the next two years — nearly one-third of the world population.” (World Health Organization as reported by the Western media, July 2009).It was a multibillion bonanza for Big Pharma supported by the WHO’s Director-General Margaret Chan. In June 2009, Margaret Chan made the following statement:“On the basis of … expert assessments of the evidence, the scientific criteria for an influenza pandemic have been met. I have therefore decided to raise the level of influenza pandemic alert from Phase 5 to Phase 6.  The world is now at the start of the 2009 influenza pandemic. … Margaret Chan, Director-General, World Health Organization (WHO), Press Briefing  11 June 2009) What “expert assessments”?In a subsequent statement she confirmed that:“Vaccine makers could produce 4.9 billion pandemic flu shots per year in the best-case scenario”,Margaret Chan, Director-General, World Health Organization (WHO), quoted by Reuters, 21 July 2009).

September 2019: The official US-WHO position is that the coronavirus originated in Wuhan, Hubei Province and was first discovered in Late December. This statement is questioned by Chinese and Japanese virologists who claim that the virus originated in the US.A renowned Taiwanese virologist pointed to evidence that the virus could have originated at an earlier stage, stating : “We must look to September of 2019”.October 18-27 2019: Wuhan 2019: CISM Sport Military World Games.

      "Instead, the exercise served to highlight preparedness and response challenges that would likely arise in a very severe pandemic. We are not now predicting that the nCoV-2019 outbreak will kill 65 million people.Although our tabletop exercise included a mock novel coronavirus, the inputs we used for modeling the potential impact of that fictional virus are not similar to nCoV-2019.“We are not now predicting that the nCoV-2019 [which was also used as the name of the simulation] outbreak will kill 65 million people.Although our tabletop exercise included a mock novel coronavirus, the inputs we used for modeling the potential impact of that fictional virus are not similar to nCoV-2019.”Several of the occurrences of the nCoV-2019 exercise coincided with what really happened. In the Event 201 Simulation of a Coronavirus Pandemic, a 15% collapse of financial markets had been “simulated”.It was not “predicted” according to the organizers and sponsors of the event.Private sector initiative. Participation of corporate execs, foundations, financial institutions, Banks, Big Pharma, CIA, CDC, China’s CDC. No health officials (with exception of CDC and China CDC) present on behalf of national governments or the WHO. The simulation exercise was held on the same day as the opening of the CISM World Militaty Sports Games in Wuhan.December 31, 2019: First cases of pneumonia detected and reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province. China.January 1, 2020: Chinese health authorities close the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market after Western media reports that wild animals sold there may have been the source of the virus. This initial assessment was subsequently refuted by Chinese scientists.January 7, 2020: Chinese authorities “identify a new type of virus” which was isolated  on 7 January. The coronavirus was named 2019-nCoV by the WHO exactly the same name as that adopted in the WEF-Gates-John Hopkins October 18, 2019 simulation exercise. January 11, 2020 – The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission announces the first death caused by the coronavirus.January 22, 2020: WHO. Members of the WHO Emergency Committee “expressed divergent views on whether this event constitutes a PHEIC or not”.January 21-24, 2020: Consultations at the World Economic Forum, Davos, Switzerland under auspices of  the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) for development of a vaccine program. CEPI is a WEF-Gates partnership. With support from CIPI, Seattle based Moderna will manufacture an mRNA vaccine against 2019-nCoV, “The Vaccine Research Center (VRC) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of NIH, collaborated with Moderna to design the vaccine.”Note: The development of a 2019 nCoV vaccine was announced at Davos, 2 weeks after the January 7, 2020 announcement, and barely a  week prior to the official launching of the WHO’s Worldwide Public Health emergency on January 30.  The WEF-Gates-CEPI Vaccine Announcement precedes the WHO Public Health Emergency (PHEIC).January  30, 2020: Geneva: WHO Director General determines that the outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). This decision was taken on the basis of 150 confirmed cases outside China, First case of person to person transmission in US is reported, 6 cases in the US, 3 cases in Canada, 2 in the UK.The WHO Director General had the backing of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Big Pharma and the World Economic Forum (WEF). There are indications that the decision for the WHO to declare a Global Emergency was taken on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos (January 21-24) overlapping with the Geneva January 22 meeting of the Emergency Committee.Both WHO’s Director Tedros as well as Bill Gates were present at Davos 2020. Bill Gates announced the Gates Foundation’s $10 billion commitment to vaccines over the next 10 years.January 30, 2020 The Simulation Exercise Went Live. The same corporate interests and foundations which were involved in the October 18 John Hopkins Simulation Exercise became REAL ACTORS involved in providing their support to the implementation of the WHO Public Health emergency (PHEIC).January 31, 2020 – One day later following the launch of WHO Global Emergency, The Trump administration announced that it will deny entry to foreign nationals “who have traveled in China in the last 14 days”. This immediately triggers a crisis in air transportation, China-US trade as well as the tourism industry, leading to substantial bankruptcies, not to mention unemployment.Immediately triggers a campaign against ethnic Chinese throughout the Western World.Early February: the acronym of the coronavirus was changed from nCoV- 2019 (its name under the October Event 201 John Hopkins Simulation Exercise before it was identified in early January 2020) to COVID-19.February 28, 2020: A massive WHO vaccination campaign was announced by WHO Director General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.Who was behind this campaign: GlaxoSmithKline in partnership with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). It is a Gates-WEF partnership, both of which were sponsors of the October 18, “Simulation Exercise”. The campaign to develop vaccines was initiated prior to decision of the WHO to launch a Global Public Health emergency. It was first announced at the WEF meeting at Davos (21-24 January).Late February 2020. Collapse of the stock markets, surge in the value of the stocks of Big Pharma.Early March devastating consequences for the tourist industry Worldwide.February 24:  Moderna Inc supported by CIPI  announced  that it experimental mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, known as mRNA-1273, was ready for human testing.Late February 2020. Second wave of transmission of the virus (Worldwide) to a large number of countries.Late February – Early March: China: More than 50% of the infected patients recover and are discharged from the hospitals. March 3, a total of 49856 patients have recovered from COVID-19 and were discharged from hospitals in China.  What this means that the total number of  “confirmed infected cases” in China is 30448. (Namely 80304 minus 49856 = 30448  (80 304 is the total number on confirmed cases in China (WHO data, March 3, 2020). These developments concerning “recovery” are not reported by the Western media.March 5, WHO Director General confirms that outside China there are 2055 cases reported in 33 countries. Around 80% of those cases continue to come from just three countries (South Korea, Iran, Italy).These figures suggested that we are not facing a global health emergency, that the probability of infection was low. And Based on China’s experience  the treatment for the virus infection was effective.March 7: USA: The number of “confirmed cases” (infected and recovered) in the United States in early March is of the order of 430, rising to about 6oo (March 8). Rapid rise in the course of March.Compare that to the figures pertaining to the Influenza B Virus: The CDC estimates for 2019-2020 “at least 15 million virus flu illnesses… 140000 hospitalizations and 8200 deaths. (The Hill) Early March:  IMF and World Bank To the Rescue.The WHO Director General advises member countries that “the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have both made funds available to stabilize health systems and mitigate the economic consequences of the epidemic”. That is the proposed neoliberal  “solution” to COVID-19. The World Bank has committed $12billion in so-called “aid” which will contribute to building up the external debt of developing countries.March 7:  China: The Pandemic is Almost Over.Reported new cases in China fall to double digit. 99 cases recorded on March 7.  All of the new cases outside Hubei province are categorized as  “imported infections”(from foreign countries). The reliability of the data remains to be established:99 newly confirmed cases including 74 in Hubei Province, … The new cases included 24 imported infections — 17 in Gansu Province, three in Beijing, three in Shanghai and one in Guangdong Province. March 10-11, 2020: Italy declares a lockdown, followed by several other countries of the EU.  Deployment of 30000 US troops in the EU as part of the “Defend Europe 2020” war games directed against Russia.March 11, 2020: the Director General of the WHO officially declares the COV-19 Pandemic. Bear in mind the global health emergency was declared on January 3oth without stating officially the existence of a pandemic outside Mainland China.March 11:  Trump orders the suspension for 30 days of all transatlantic flights from countries of the European Union, with the exception of Britain. Coincides with the collapse of airline stocks and a new wave of financial instability. Devastating impacts on the tourist industry in Western Europe.March 16: Moderna  mRNA-1273 is tested in several stages with 45 volunteers in Seattle, Washington State. The vaccine program started in early February:“We don’t know whether this vaccine will induce an immune response, or whether it will be safe. That’s why we’re doing a trial,” Jackson stressed. “It’s not at the stage where it would be possible or prudent to give it to the general population.” (AP, March 16, 2020)March 21, 2020: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo while addressing the American people from the White House stated that COVID-19 is a live military exercise.“This is not about retribution, … This matter is going forward — we are in a live exercise here to get this right.”With a disgusted look on his face, President Trump replied: “You should have let us know.”April 8, 2020: Mounting fear campaign led by Western media. Very rapid increase in so-called “confirmed cases”. “1282931 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 72776 deaths, reported to WHO” (April 8). Mounting doubts on the reported “confirmed cases” of COVID-19. Failures of the CDC’s categorization and statistical estimates.March- April: Planet Lockdown. Devastating economic and social consequences. The economic and social impacts far exceed those attributed to the coronavirus. Cited below are selected examples of  a global process: Massive job losses and layoffs in the US, with more than 10 million workers filing claims for unemployment benefits.In India,  a 21 days lockdown has triggered a wave of famine and despair affecting millions of homeless migrant workers all over the country. No lockdown for the homeless: “too poor to afford a meal”. The impoverishment in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa is beyond description. For large sectors of the urban population, household income has literally been wiped out.In Italy, the destabilization of the tourist industry has resulted in bankruptcies and rising unemployment. In many countries, citizens are the object of police violence. Five people involved in protests against the lockdown were killed by police in Kenya and South Africa.\n",

      "When you start researching and reading about what is going on with this “new” virus, you will be taken down a rabbit hole… It might not be pretty, but you will see the truth. I am planning to write more about it later this week. Bill Gates is a known eugenicist. And he does not hide it! He has claimed several times that we need to reduce the population on earth. And he stated that vaccination is one tool to achieve just that! Maybe that is why his children are not vaccinated… Vaccination is an act of genocide, it is a eugenic tool used by the globalists. Genocide is an intentional action to destroy a people in whole or in part. That is what vaccines exactly do! There is no conspiracy theory in what I am about to say. Everything is supported by facts, and you can verify yourself. This eugenic program, which is vaccination, takes root in the Rockefeller and Bill Gates foundations. Several lines of current immunological contraceptive research continue to seek what, during the 1930s, Max Mason of the Rockefeller Foundation called “anti-hormones”: vaccines to block hormones needed for very early pregnancy and a vaccine to block the hormone needed for the surface of the egg to function properly. The Rockefeller Foundation launched massive funding-operations into anti-fertility vaccines, the Task Force on Vaccines for Fertility Regulation was created under auspices of the World Health Organization, World Bank, and the UN Population Fund. Its mission, according to one of its members, to support: “basic and clinical research on the development of birth control vaccines directed against the gametes or the preimplantation embryo. These studies have involved the use of advanced procedures in peptide chemistry, hybridoma technology, and molecular genetics, as well as the evaluation of a number of novel approaches in general vaccinology. As a result of this international, collaborative effort, a prototype anti-HCG vaccine is now undergoing clinical testing, raising the prospect that a totally new family planning method may be available before the end of the current decade.” In regards to the scope of the Task Force’s jurisdiction, the Biotechnology and Development Monitor reported: “The Task Force acts as a global coordinating body for anti-fertility vaccine R&D in the various working groups and supports research on different approaches, such as anti-sperm and anti-ovum vaccines and vaccines designed to neutralize the biological functions of hCG. The Task Force has succeeded in developing a prototype of an anti-hCG-vaccine”. “If vaccines could be developed which could safely and effectively inhibit fertility, without producing unacceptable side effects, they would be an attractive addition to the present armamentarium of fertility regulating methods and would be likely to have a significant impact on family planning programs.” Right there, they openly claim that they are doing some research on anti-fertility vaccines. In 1986 Mr. Spieler, a member of the Task Force, declared: “A new approach to fertility regulation is the development of vaccines directed against human substances required for reproduction. Potential candidates for immunological interference include reproductive hormones, ovum, and sperm antigens, and antigens derived from embryonic or fetal tissue. An antifertility vaccine must be capable of safely and effectively inhibiting a human substance, which would need somehow to be rendered antigenic. A fertility-regulating vaccine, moreover, would have to produce and sustain effective immunity in at least 95% of the vaccinated population, a level of protection rarely achieved even with the most successful viral and bacterial vaccines. But while these challenges looked insuperable just a few years ago, recent advances in biotechnology- particularly in the fields of molecular biology, genetic engineering, and monoclonal antibody production- are bringing antifertility vaccines into the realm of the feasible.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Author Jurriaan Maessan stumbled upon some very compelling and important research back in 2010 while digging through annual reports for the Rockefeller Foundation that conclusively prove that it funded numerous research projects into the development “anti-fertility” vaccines, with its origins in scientific research dating back to at least 1968, and with successful research conducted by at least 1988. There now exists several methods to sterilize both men and women by injection, as well as to terminate pregnancies and/or induce spontaneous abortions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Rockefeller family, among others, financed Eugenics research at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Nazi Germany, where some of the most horrifying “scientific” research was conducted, including the work of Josef Mengele.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following World War II, Eugenics was re-branded to cast off its associations with the Nazis, and emerged, as it were, in the form of such social policy topics as “population control,” “family planning,” abortion/Planned Parenthood, health care, various types of genetics, even laced in between such screeds as global warming/climate change, which leads to arguments about reducing the burden of over-population upon the earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bill Gates and David Rockefeller were the leading members of a billionaires’ club that met in secret to discuss how to strengthen measures for population control, particularly in the developing world, through the guise of “philanthropy.” Other notable members include Ted Turner, George Soros, Warren Buffett, Oprah Winfrey, and Michael Bloomberg.\n",

      "Anti-fertility vaccines published in Vaccine. 1989 Apr;7(2):97-101.\n",
      "“Vaccines are under development for the control of fertility in males and females. This review discusses developments in anti-fertility vaccines at the National Institute of Immunology, New Delhi, India. A single injection procedure for the sterilization or castration of male animals depending on the site at which the injection is given has passed through field testing and is expected to be on the market in the near future. Vaccines inducing antibodies against the human chorionic gonadotropin have gone through phase I trials with satisfactory results. A vaccine producing a consistently bioeffective antibody response against gonadotropin-releasing hormone is ready for phase I/II clinical trials in patients of carcinoma of the prostate after due experimentation in animals and toxicology studies. Research to identify sperm antigens for incorporation into second-generation vaccines is in progress.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“LDH-C4, a sperm-specific mitochondrial antigen, produced an antibody response in baboons and reduced fertility in the females. Animal fertility control vaccines will be shortly on the market, but the use of recombinant DNA techniques should also accelerate the development of others.” Then, another article in Vaccine Wkly. 1995 May 29 – Jun 5:9-10.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tetanus vaccine may be laced with an anti-fertility drug. International / developing countries.”\n",
      "A priest, president of Human Life International (HLI) based in Maryland, has asked Congress to investigate reports of women in some developing countries unknowingly receiving a tetanus vaccine laced with the anti-fertility drug human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). If it is true, he wants Congress to publicly condemn the mass vaccinations and to cut off funding to UN agencies and other involved organizations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The natural hormone hCG is needed to maintain pregnancy. The hormone would produce antibodies against hCG to prevent pregnancy. In the fall of 1994, the Pro-Life Committee of Mexico was suspicious of the protocols for the tetanus toxoid campaign because they excluded all males and children and called for multiple injections of the vaccine in only women of reproductive age.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, one injection provides protection for at least 10 years. The Committee had vials of the tetanus vaccine analyzed for hCG. It informed HLI about the tetanus toxoid vaccine. HLI then told its World Council members and HLI affiliates in more than 60 countries. Similar tetanus vaccines laced with hCG have been uncovered in the Philippines and in Nicaragua.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the World Health Organization (WHO), other organizations involved in the development of an anti-fertility vaccine using hCG include the UN Population Fund, the UN Development Programme, the World Bank, the Population Council, the Rockefeller Foundation, the US National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, and Uppsala, Helsinki, and Ohio State universities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The priest objects that, if indeed the purpose of the mass vaccinations is to prevent pregnancies, women are uninformed, unsuspecting, and unconsenting victims.\n",
      "\n",
      "The same story happened in Kenya.\n",
      "\n",
      "In October 2014, the conference of Catholic bishops in Kenya released a statement regarding the tetanus vaccine program implemented under UN auspices.\n",
      "\n",
      "The issue was subsequently addressed by Kenya’s Catholic Doctors Association. (see article below).\n",
      "\n",
      "Published below are the following texts:\n",
      "\n",
      "a recent review article pertaining to the 2014 findings of Kenya’s Catholic Doctors Association concerning the tetanus vaccine. No update is provided in this article with regard to Kenya.\n",
      "the original 2014 statement by the Conference of Catholic Bishops.\n",
      "the 2014 response by UNICEF and the WHO with regard to the tetanus vaccine.\n",
      "May 23, 2019\n",
      "\n",
      "According to LifeSiteNews, [November 2014] a Catholic publication, the Kenya Catholic Doctors Association is charging UNICEF and WHO with sterilizing millions of girls and women under cover of an anti-tetanus vaccination program sponsored by the Kenyan government.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Kenya Catholic Doctors Association, however, saw evidence to the contrary and had six different samples of the tetanus vaccine from various locations around Kenya sent to an independent laboratory in South Africa for testing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The results confirmed their worst fears: all six samples tested positive for the HCG antigen. The HCG antigen is used in anti-fertility vaccines but was found present in tetanus vaccines targeted to young girls and women of childbearing age. Dr. Ngare, a spokesman for the Kenya Catholic Doctors Association, stated in a bulletin released November 4:\n",
      "\n",
      "“This proved right our worst fears; that this WHO campaign is not about eradicating neonatal tetanus but a well-coordinated forceful population control mass sterilization exercise using a proven fertility regulating vaccine. This evidence was presented to the Ministry of Health before the third round of immunization but was ignored.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Ngare brought up several points about the mass tetanus vaccination program in Kenya that caused the Catholic doctors to become suspicious:\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Ngare told said that several things alerted doctors in the Church’s far-flung medical system of 54 hospitals, 83 health centers, and 17 medical and nursing schools to the possibility the anti-tetanus campaign was secretly an anti-fertility campaign.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, they ask, does it involve an unprecedented five shots (or “jabs” as they are known, in Kenya) over more than two years and why is it applied only to women of childbearing years, and why is it being conducted without the usual fanfare of government publicity?\n",
      "\n",
      "“Usually we give a series three shots over two to three years, we give it anyone who comes into the clinic with an open wound, men, women or children,” said Dr. Ngare.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it is the five vaccination regime that is most alarming. “The only time tetanus vaccine has been given in five doses is when it is used as a carrier in fertility regulating vaccines laced with the pregnancy hormone, Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG) developed by WHO in 1992.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It should be noted that UNICEF and WHO distribute these vaccines for free and that there are financial incentives for the Kenyan government to participate in these programs. When funds from the UN are not enough to purchase yearly allotments of vaccines, an organization started and funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, GAVI, provides extra funding for many of these vaccination programs in poor countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "UNICEF began a similar mass vaccination program with 500000 doses of live oral polio vaccine in the Philippines after a Super Typhoon devastated Tacloban and surrounding areas. This was in spite of the fact there were no reported cases of polio in the Philippines since 1993, and people who have had the live polio vaccine can “shed” the virus into sewage systems, thereby causing the actual disease it is supposed to be preventing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very similar mass vaccination with the live oral polio vaccine occurred among Syrian refugees in 2013 when 1.7 million doses of polio vaccine were purchased by UNICEF, in spite of the fact that no cases of polio had been seen since 1999. After the mass vaccination program started, cases of polio began to reappear in Syria.\n",
      "\n",
      "It seems quite apparent that UNICEF and WHO use these local disasters to mass vaccinate people, mainly children and young women. Massive education and propaganda efforts are also necessary to convince the local populations that they need these vaccines.\n",
      "\n",
      "This dubious enterprise led to a massive vaccine initiative to vaccinate against relatively rare tetanus in The Philippines, Nicaragua, and Mexico. These vaccine vials, distributed by the WHO, were found to contain hCG, which, when combined with tetanus toxoid carrier, stimulated the formation of antibodies against human chorionic gonadotropin, rendering women incapable of maintaining a pregnancy and potentially inducing a covert, involuntary abortion. Population control under the cover of health care.\n",

      "The authors state:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Approximately 60% of women who did not receive the HPV vaccine had been pregnant at least once, whereas only 35% of women who were exposed to the vaccine had conceived. For married women, 75% who did not receive the shot were found to conceive, while only 50% who received the vaccine had ever been pregnant. Using logistic regression to analyze the data, the probability of having been pregnant was estimated for females who received an HPV vaccine compared with females who did not receive the shot. Results suggest that females who received the HPV shot were less likely to have ever been pregnant than women in the same age group who did not receive the shot. If 100% of females in this study had received the HPV vaccine, data suggest the number of women having ever conceived would have fallen by 2 million.”\n",

      "As much as Covid-19 is a circuit breaker, a time bomb and an actual weapon of mass destruction (WMD), a fierce debate is raging worldwide on the wisdom of mass quarantine applied to entire cities, states and nations.Those against it argue Planet Lockdown not only is not stopping the spread of Covid-19 but also has landed the global economy into a cryogenic state – with unforeseen, dire consequences. Thus quarantine should apply essentially to the population with the greatest risk of death: the elderly.With Planet Lockdown transfixed by heart-breaking reports from the Covid-19 frontline, there’s no question this is an incendiary assertion.In parallel, a total corporate media takeover is implying that if the numbers do not substantially go down, Planet Lockdown – an euphemism for house arrest – remains, indefinitely.Michael Levitt, 2013 Nobel Prize in chemistry and Stanford biophysicist, was spot on when he calculated that China would get through the worst of Covid-19 way before throngs of health experts believed, and that “What we need is to control the panic”.Let’s cross this over with some facts and dissident opinion, in the interest of fostering an informed debate.The report Covid-19 – Navigating the Uncharted was co-authored by Dr. Anthony Fauci – the White House face of the fight –, H. Clifford Lane, and CDC director Robert R. Redfield. So it comes from the heart of the U.S. healthcare establishment.The report explicitly states, “the overall clinical consequences of Covid-19 may ultimately be more akin to those of a severe seasonal influenza (which has a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1%) or a pandemic influenza (similar to those in 1957 and 1968) rather than a disease similar to SARS or MERS, which have had case fatality rates of 9 to 10% and 36%, respectively.”On March 19, four days before Downing Street ordered the British lockdown, Covid-19 was downgraded from the status of “High Consequence Infectious Disease.”John Lee, recently retired professor of pathology and former NHS consultant pathologist, has recently argued that, “the world’s 18944 coronavirus deaths represent 0.14 per cent of the total. These figures might shoot up but they are, right now, lower than other infectious diseases that we live with (such as flu).”\n",
      "He recommends, “a degree of social distancing should be maintained for a while, especially for the elderly and the immune-suppressed. But when drastic measures are introduced, they should be based on clear evidence. In the case of Covid-19, the evidence is not clear.”That’s essentially the same point developed by a Russian military intel analyst.No less than 22 scientists – see here and here – have expanded on their doubts about the Western strategy.Dr. Sucharit Bhakdi, Professor Emeritus of Medical Microbiology at the Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, has provoked immense controversy with his open letter to Chancellor Merkel, stressing the “truly unforeseeable consequences of the drastic containment measures which are currently being applied in large parts of Europe.”Even New York governor Andrew Cuomo admitted on the record about the error of quarantining elderly people with illnesses alongside the fit young population.The absolutely key issue is how the West was caught completely unprepared for the spread of Covid-19 – even after being provided a head start of two months by China, and having the time to study different successful strategies applied across Asia.There are no secrets for the success of the South Korean model.South Korea was producing test kits already in early January, and by March was testing 100000 people a day, after establishing strict control of the whole population – to Western cries of “no protection of private life”. That was before the West embarked on Planet Lockdown mode.South Korea was all about testing early, often and safely – in tandem with quick, thorough contact tracing, isolation and surveillance.Covid-19 carriers are monitored with the help of video-surveillance cameras, credit card purchases, smartphone records. Add to it SMS sent to everyone when a new case is detected near them or their place of work. Those in self-isolation need an app to be constantly monitored; non-compliance means a fine to the equivalent of $2800.Controlled demolition in effect. In early March, the Chinese Journal of Infectious Diseases, hosted by the Shanghai Medical Association, pre-published an Expert Consensus on Comprehensive Treatment of Coronavirus in Shanghai. Treatment recommendations included, “large doses of vitamin C…injected intravenously at a dose of 100 to 200 mg / kg per day. The duration of continuous use is to significantly improve the oxygenation index.”That’s the reason why 50 tons of Vitamin C was shipped to Hubei province in early February. It’s a stark example of a simple “mitigation” solution capable of minimizing economic catastrophe.In contrast, it’s as if the brutally fast Chinese “people’s war” counterpunch against Covid-19 had caught Washington totally unprepared. Steady intel rumbles on the Chinese net point to Beijing having already studied all plausible leads towards the origin of the Sars-Cov-2 virus – vital information that will be certainly weaponized, Sun Tzu style, at the right time.As it stands, the sustainability of the complex Eurasian integration project has not been substantially compromised. As the EU has provided the whole planet with a graphic demonstration of its cluelessness and helplessness, everyday the Russia-China strategic partnership gets stronger – increasingly investing in soft power and advancing a pan-Eurasia dialogue which includes, crucially, medical help.Facing this process, the EU’s top diplomat, Joseph Borrell, sounds indeed so helpless: “There is a global battle of narratives going on in which timing is a crucial factor. […] China has brought down local new infections to single figures – and it is now sending equipment and doctors to Europe, as others do as well. China is aggressively pushing the message that, unlike the U.S., it is a responsible and reliable partner. In the battle of narratives we have also seen attempts to discredit the EU (…) We must be aware there is a geo-political component including a struggle for influence through spinning and the ‘politics of generosity’. Armed with facts, we need to defend Europe against its detractors.”That takes us to really explosive territory. A critique of the Planet Lockdown strategy inevitably raises serious questions pointing to a controlled demolition of the global economy. What is already in stark effect are myriad declinations of martial law, severe social media policing in Ministry of Truth mode, and the return of strict border controls.These are unequivocal markings of a massive social re-engineering project, complete with inbuilt full monitoring, population control and social distancing promoted as the new normal.That would be taking to the limit Secretary of State Mike “we lie, we cheat, we steal” Pompeo’s assertion, on the record, that Covid-19 is a live military exercise: “This matter is going forward — we are in a live exercise here to get this right.”All hail BlackRock.So as we face a New Great Depression, steps leading to a Brave New World are already discernable. It goes way beyond a mere Bretton Woods 2.0, in the manner that Pam and Russ Martens superbly deconstruct the recent $2 trillion, Capitol Hill-approved stimulus to the U.S. economy.Essentially, the Fed will “leverage the bill’s $454 million bailout slush fund into $4.5 trillion”. And no questions are allowed on who gets the money, because the bill simply cancels the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) for the Fed.The privileged private contractor for the slush fund is none other than BlackRock. Here’s the extremely short version of the whole, astonishing scheme, masterfully detailed here.Wall Street has turned the Fed into a hedge fund. The Fed is going to own at least two thirds of all U.S. Treasury bills wallowing in the market before the end of the year.The U.S. Treasury will be buying every security and loan in sight while the Fed will be the banker – financing the whole scheme.So essentially this is a Fed/ Treasury merger. A behemoth dispensing loads of helicopter money – with BlackRock as the undisputable winner.\n",
      "BlackRock is widely known as the biggest money manager on the planet. Their tentacles are everywhere. They own 5% of Apple, 5% of Exxon Mobil, 6% of Google, second largest shareholder of AT&T (Turner, HBO, CNN, Warner Brothers) – these are just a few examples.They will buy all these securities and manage those dodgy special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) on behalf of the Treasury.BlackRock not only is the top investor in Goldman Sachs. Better yet: Blackrock is bigger than Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank combined. BlackRock is a serious Trump donor. Now, for all practical purposes, it will be the operating system – the Chrome, Firefox, Safari – of Fed/Treasury.This represents the definitive Wall Street-ization of the Fed – with no evidence whatsoever it will lead to any improvement in the lives of the average American.\n",
      "Western corporate media, en masse, have virtually ignored the myriad, devastating economic consequences of Planet Lockdown. Wall to wall coverage barely mentions the astonishing economic human wreckage already in effect – especially for the masses barely surviving, so far, in the informal economy.For all practical purposes, the Global War on Terror (GWOT) has been replaced by the Global War on Virus (GWOV). But what is not being seriously analyzed is the Perfect Toxic Storm: a totally shattered economy; The Mother of All Financial Crashes – barely masked by the trillions in helicopter money from the Fed and the ECB; the tens of millions of unemployed engendered by the New Great Depression; the millions of small businesses that will simply disappear; a widespread, global mental health crisis. Not to mention the masses of elderly, especially in the U.S., that will be issued an unspoken “drop dead” notice.Beyond any rhetoric about “decoupling”, the global economy is already, de facto, split in two. On one side, we have Eurasia, Africa and swathes of Latin America – what China will be painstakingly connecting and reconnecting via the New Silk Roads. On the other side, we have North America and selected Western vassals. A puzzled Europe lies in the middle.A cryogenically induced global economy certainly facilitates a reboot. Trumpism is the New Exceptionalism – so that means an isolationist MAGA on steroids. In contrast, China will painstakingly reboot its market base along the New Silk Roads – Africa and Latin America included – to replace the 20% of trade/exports to be lost with the U.S.The meager $1200 checks promised to Americans are a de facto precursor of the much touted Universal Basic Income (UBI). They may become permanent as tens of millions of people will be permanently unemployed. That will facilitate the transition towards a totally automated, 24/7 economy run by AI – thus the importance of 5G.And that’s where ID2020 comes in.AI and ID2020. The European Commission is involved in a crucial but virtually unknown project, CREMA (Cloud Based Rapid Elastic Manufacturing) which aims to facilitate the widest possible implementation of AI in conjunction to the advent of a cashless One-World system.The end of cash necessarily implies a One-World government capable of dispensing – and controlling – UBI; a de facto full accomplishment of Foucault’s studies on biopolitics. Anyone is liable to be erased from the system if an algorithm equals this individual with dissent.It gets even sexier when absolute social control is promoted as an innocent vaccine.ID2020 is self-described as a benign alliance of “public-private partners”. Essentially, it is an electronic ID platform based on generalized vaccination. And its starts at birth; newborns will be provided with a “portable and persistent biometrically-linked digital identity.”GAVI, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, pledges to “protect people’s health “ and provide “immunization for all”. Top partners and sponsors, apart from the WHO, include, predictably, Big Pharma.At the ID2020 Alliance summit last September in New York, it was decided that the “Rising to the Good ID Challenge” program would be launched in 2020. That was confirmed by the World Economic Forum (WEF) this past January in Davos. The digital identity will be tested with the government of Bangladesh.That poses a serious question: was ID2020 timed to coincide with what a crucial sponsor, the WHO, qualified as a pandemic? Or was a pandemic absolutely crucial to justify the launch of ID2020?As game-changing trial runs go, nothing of course beats Event 201, which took place less than a month after ID2020.The Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in partnership with, once again, the WEF, as well as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, described Event 201 as “a high-level pandemic exercise”. The exercise “illustrated areas where public/private partnerships will be necessary during the response to a severe pandemic in order to diminish large-scale economic and societal consequences.”With Covid-19 in effect as a pandemic, the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health was forced to issue a statement basically saying they just “modeled a fictional coronavirus pandemic, but we explicitly stated that it was not a prediction”.There’s no question “a severe pandemic, which becomes ‘Event 201’ would require reliable cooperation among several industries, national governments, and key international institutions”, as spun by the sponsors. Covid-19 is eliciting exactly this kind of “cooperation”. Whether it’s “reliable” is open to endless debate.\n",
      "The fact is that, all over Planet Lockdown, a groundswell of public opinion is leaning towards defining the current state of affairs as a global psyop: a deliberate global meltdown – the New Great Depression – imposed on unsuspecting citizens by design.The powers that be, taking their cue from the tried and tested, decades-old CIA playbook, of course are breathlessly calling it a “conspiracy theory”. Yet what vast swathes of global public opinion observe is a – dangerous – virus being used as cover for the advent of a new, digital financial system, complete with a forced vaccine cum nanochip creating a full, individual, digital identity.The most plausible scenario for our immediate future reads like clusters of smart cities linked by AI, with people monitored full time and duly micro-chipped doing what they need with a unified digital currency, in an atmosphere of Bentham’s and Foucault’s Panopticum on overdrive.\n",

      "It is proved: the coronavirus is created artificially and is a military weapon !!US biological warfare against China. Anand Ranganatan, a professor of genetics at Jawaharlal Nehru State University in Delhi, and his colleagues published a report on a study of Chinese coronavirus.They found that it was formed from two different types of coronavirus, distributed among animals (bats and snakes), as well as four virus-like inserts characteristic of HIV. No known coronavirus has such a structure.Thus, scientists have clearly proved that the virus was created artificially and is a battle. China's National Health Commission reported 31161 confirmed cases.Taking into account the number of infected people in all countries, as of February 7, there were 31452 people, 638 people died. (More died, but this number will not sound: you will not return the dead and will not give incense to the tramp. pandemics other methods without fail.) In this regard, it can be recalled that currently there is a fierce, not for life, but for death, the so-called trade war between the United States and China. And somehow “by accident”, as if by magic, at that time and in China, the coronavirus erupted, which had already done tremendous harm to the Chinese economy and sharply weakened Beijing’s position in the negotiations.The Chinese stock market collapsed after the opening of trading on exchanges, according to Bloomberg, who called what was happening \"an unprecedented bout of sale.\" For ten days, the financial markets of China and Hong Kong were on vacation in connection with the celebration of the New Year in this country.The collapse of the main indices by more than 8% is associated with the epidemic of coronavirus.The shares of telecommunications, technology and mining companies are falling the most. Crude oil futures fell 7%, iron ore 6.5% and ferrous metals 6%. Copper, oil and palm oil also fell to the daily limit allowed on the Chinese market.“Most people in the market have never faced this situation, they cannot be blamed for the need for money when they feel a threat to their health,” said Fan Ryu, Managing Director of Shanghai WuSheng Investment Management Partnership.\n",
      "Even before the spread of coronavirus, many experts wrote that in recent years, Washington, contrary to international law, has been actively developing biological weapons in its many laboratories located both on American territory and abroad.Last November, Secretary of the Security Council of Russia Nikolai Patrushev, who was well acquainted with this issue, warned about this danger and listed the main threats to security in many countries of the world.One of the points was devoted to the policy “aimed at the destruction of a single humanitarian space and the separation of peoples” in relation to the CIS and the CSTO, and also related to the creation of US biological laboratories in their territory:“Of particular concern is the Pentagon’s efforts to create biological laboratories around the world, primarily in the CIS countries, where infectious diseases are studied and biological weapons can be created.”Later, information appeared that the United States commissioned more than 200 biological laboratories around the world, and they are located in Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Uzbekistan and Ukraine.By the way, commenting on a study by Indian scientists, ex-member of the UN Commission on Biological and Chemical Weapons, military expert Igor Nikulin emphasized that in China, patients with coronavirus have been treated with AIDS drugs, and there are people who have recovered.So, in an interview with Moskovsky Komsomolets, he said: “This is definitely a combat virus. There is no doubt that it was created purposefully. ” While scientists are creating a vaccine against a new type of coronavirus, doctors recall that the main methods of dealing with it are the same as against influenza.\n",
      "The main question is - who benefits from having another epidemic unsettle a powerful competitor? If we apply the well-known trick highly likely, unceremoniously used by the British ex-prime minister Theresa May to hang the so-called Skripals poisoning in Russia, the answer is obvious: the coronavirus epidemic 2019-nCoV, which hit China, is highly likely to be in the hands of the United States.And the worse for Beijing, the better for Washington. Moreover, the outlook for the epidemic is not yet encouraging. For example, some experts say that if the spread of the virus cannot be stopped, up to 250 million Chinese can become its victims!\n",
      "It is noteworthy that the virus got to the American technological giant Apple, whose production area is only 500 kilometers from the \"homeland\" of the coronavirus - the Wuhan metropolis. And now, according to the Nikkei Asian Review, the production of popular iPhone smartphones is in jeopardy.\n",
      "Starbucks also found itself in a difficult situation, which, due to quarantine, had to close a large half of its four thousand coffee houses operating in China (by the way, this is the second largest market after the United States).But at the same time, the Americans for some reason do not look like such victims of the epidemic, especially Apple, whose leadership at the very beginning of the trade and economic confrontation with China advised to evacuate production facilities in the United States.It seems as if President Trump saw everything in advance, like some kind of psychic. But most likely, he simply decided to punish those American companies whose leaders did not obey his insistent \"advice\" to return their production facilities to the United States. However, both Apple and Starbucks were really out of luck.\n",
      "You can’t say the same about the American political establishment, which is making titanic efforts to bring to its knees the \"presumptuous China.\" And why should these efforts necessarily be of an economic nature? In such a war, all means are good, and no matter what banned weapons the United States uses, it is clear that none of the Americans will be in the dock of the International Court of Justice.It may be recalled that the United States is not the first to use biological and chemical weapons. During the war, the US Army sprayed 72 million liters of Agent Orange defoliants in South Vietnam to destroy forests, including 44 million liters containing 2378-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin.This substance is a persistent substance that enters the human body with water and food, it causes various diseases of the liver and blood, massive congenital malformations of newborns and violations of the normal course of pregnancy. After the use of the US military defoliants, after the war, several tens of thousands of people died. Altogether, there are about 4.8 million victims of defoliant spraying in Vietnam, including three million directly affected.The current bloated coronavirus epidemic has already done tremendous harm not only to the Chinese economy, but also to many countries of the world. Cancellation of flights, suspension of production, violation of logistics, non-participation in fairs. The epidemic from China is forcing more and more large companies to change plans and improvise.However, the sharp reduction in air traffic with China around the world not only reduces the revenues of airlines and airports, losing passengers and traffic, but also creates more and more serious problems for firms from various industries. This was pointed out by World Bank President David Malpass, warning of an impending decrease in the forecast for global economic growth rates “at least in the first part of 2020”. He recalled that \"many Chinese goods are delivered around the world in the womb of passenger aircraft.\" Now, companies have to quickly adapt their supply chains to new conditions.Coronavirus is more dangerous, for example, for the German economy than for its inhabitants. Lufthansa cancels all flights to China, the German travel industry is losing Chinese customers, companies from Germany stop production in China. Due to the epidemic, the business begins to suffer losses. However, mostly fairly wealthy Chinese people travel to Germany, therefore, guests from China occupy the second place among foreign visitors of the country in terms of total expenses for traveling and staying in Germany. According to German media estimates, they spend a total of about 6 billion euros a year on transport and hotel services, food and shopping.Many German attractions will soon be missing tourists from China. Pointing out the importance of Chinese tourists to the \"retail and tourism and entertainment industries in Germany,\" DZT head Petra Hedorfer, in a special press statement, expressed the hope that \"the situation will normalize soon,\" and recalled that the main season for visiting Germany by Chinese tourists - this is summer. So the industry has a hope to win back those losses that will begin to grow rapidly in the coming days.All this gave rise to the German edition of Handelsblatt to draw the following conclusion: “Donald Trump is a destroyer, in the truest sense of the word. Three years of his presidency were enough to undermine the world trade order and undermine confidence in the World Trade Organization (WTO), NATO and the Paris climate compromise. ”To this can now be added the conduct of a biological war against unyielding rivals. Not by washing, so by skating, the Russian proverb says.It is proved: the coronavirus is artificially created and is combat\n",

      "The most commonly reported mainstream media account of the creation of the Coronavirus suggests that it was derived from an animal borne microorganism found in a wild bat that was consumed by an ethnic Chinese resident of Wuhan. But there appears to be some evidence to dispute that in that adjacent provinces in China, where wild bats are more numerous, have not experienced major outbreaks of the disease. Because of that and other factors, there has also been considerable speculation that the Coronavirus did not occur naturally through mutation but rather was produced in a laboratory, possibly as a biological warfare agent.Several reports suggest that there are components of the virus that are related to HIV that could not have occurred naturally. If it is correct that the virus had either been developed or even produced to be weaponized it would further suggest that its escape from the Wuhan Institute of Virology Lab and into the animal and human population could have been accidental. Technicians who work in such environments are aware that “leaks” from laboratories occur frequently.\n",
      "There is, of course and inevitably, another theory. There has been some speculation that as the Trump Administration has been constantly raising the issue of growing Chinese global competitiveness as a direct threat to American national security and economic dominance, it must might be possible that Washington has created and unleashed the virus in a bid to bring Beijing’s growing economy and military might down a few notches. It is, to be sure, hard to believe that even the Trump White House would do something so reckless, but there are precedents for that type of behavior. In 2005-9 the American and Israeli governments secretly developed a computer virus called Stuxnet, which was intended to damage the control and operating systems of Iranian computers being used in that country’s nuclear research program. Admittedly Stuxnet was intended to damage computers, not to infect or kill human beings, but concerns that it would propagate and move to infect computers outside Iran proved to be accurate as it spread to thousands of PCs outside Iran, in countries as far flung as China, Germany, Kazakhstan and Indonesia.Inevitably there is an Israeli story that just might shed some light on what has been going on in China. Scientists at Israel’s Galilee Research Institute are now claiming that they will have a vaccine against coronavirus in a few weeks which will be ready for distribution and use within 90 days. The institute is claiming that it has been engaged in four years of research on avian coronavirus funded by Israel’s Ministries of Science & Technology and Agriculture. They are claiming that the virus is similar to the version that has infected humans, which has led to breakthroughs in development through genetic manipulation, but some scientists are skeptical that a new vaccine could be produced so quickly to prevent a virus that existed only recently. They also have warned that even if a vaccine is developed it would normally have to be tested for side effects, a process that normally takes over a year and includes using it on infected humans.If one even considers it possible that the United States had a hand in creating the coronavirus at what remains of its once extensive biological weapons research center in Ft Detrick Maryland, it is very likely that Israel was a partner in the project. Helping to develop the virus would also explain how Israeli scientists have been able to claim success at creating a vaccine so quickly, possibly because the virus and a treatment for it were developed simultaneously.In any event, there are definite political ramifications to the appearance of the coronavirus, and not only in China. In the United States President Donald Trump is already being blamed for lying about the virus and there are various scenarios in mainstream publications speculating over the possible impact on the election in 2020. If the economy sinks together with the stock market, it will reflect badly on Trump whether or not he is actually at fault. If containment and treatment of the disease itself in the United States does not go well, there could also be a considerable backlash, particularly as the Democrats have been promoting improving health care. One pundit argues, however, that disease and a sinking economy will not matter as long as there is a turnaround before the election, but a lot can happen in the next eight months.And then there is the national security/foreign policy issue as seen from both Jerusalem and Washington. It is difficult to explain why coronavirus has hit one country in particular other than China very severely. That country is Iran, the often-cited enemy of both the U.S. and Israel. The number of Iran’s coronavirus cases continues to increase, with more positive tests confirmed among government officials last Saturday. There were 205 new coronavirus cases, bringing the government claimed total to 593 with 43 fatalities, though unofficial hospital reports suggest that the deaths are actually well over 100. That’s the highest number of deaths from the virus outside of China.No less than five Iranian Members of Parliament have also tested positive amid a growing number of officials that have contracted the disease. Iran’s vice president Masoumeh Ebtekar and deputy health minister Iraj Harirchi had also previously been confirmed with the virus.The usual suspects in the United States are delighted to learn of the Iranian deaths. Mark Dubowitz, Executive Director of the Washington-based but Israeli government connected Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) boasted on twitter Tuesday that “Coronavirus has done what American economic sanctions could not: shut down non-oil exports.” An Iranian government spokesman responded that “It’s shameful and downright inhuman to cheer for a deadly Virus to spread – and enjoy seeing people suffer for it…” Dubowitz followed up with an additional taunt, that Tehran has “spread terrorism” in the Middle East and “now it’s spreading the coronavirus.”So, you have your choice. Coronavirus occurred naturally, or it came out of a lab in China itself or even from Israel or the United States. If one suspects Israel and/or the United States, the intent clearly would have been to create a biological weapon that would damage two nations that have been designated as enemies. But the coronavirus cannot be contained easily and it is clear that many thousands of people will die from it. Unfortunately, as with Stuxnet, once the genie is out of the bottled it is devilishly hard to induce it to go back in.Who Made Coronavirus? Was It the U.S., Israel or China Itself?\n",

      "Abundant clinical evidence confirms vitamin C’s powerful antiviral effect when used in sufficient quantity. Treating influenza with very large amounts of vitamin C is not a new idea at all. Frederick R. Klenner, MD, and Robert F. Cathcart, MD, successfully used this approach for decades. Frequent oral dosing with vitamin C sufficient to reach a daily bowel tolerance limit will work for most persons. Intravenous vitamin C is indicated for the most serious cases.Bowel tolerance levels of vitamin C, taken as divided doses all throughout the day, are a clinically proven antiviral without equal. Vitamin C can be used alone or right along with medicines if one so chooses.“Some physicians would stand by and see their patients die rather than use ascorbic acid. Vitamin C should be given to the patient while the doctors ponder the diagnosis.” (Frederick R. Klenner, MD, chest specialist). Dr. Robert Cathcart advocated treating influenza with up to 150000 milligrams of vitamin C daily, often intravenously. You and I can, to some extent, simulate a 24 hour IV of vitamin C by taking it by mouth very, very often. When I had pneumonia, it took 2000 mg of vitamin C every six minutes, by the clock, to get me to saturation. My oral daily dose was over 100000 mg. Fever, cough and other symptoms were reduced in hours; complete recovery took just a few days. That is performance at least as good as any pharmaceutical will give, and the vitamin is both safer and cheaper. Many physicians consider high doses of vitamin C to be so powerful an antiviral that it may be ranked as a functional immunization for a variety influenza strains. \n",
      "Dr. Cathcart writes: “The sicker a person was, the more ascorbic acid they would tolerate orally without it causing diarrhea. In a person with an otherwise normal GI tract when they were well, would tolerate 5 to 15 grams of ascorbic acid orally in divided doses without diarrhea. With a mild cold 30 to 60 grams; with a bad cold, 100 grams; with a flu, 150 grams; and with mononucleosis, viral pneumonia, etc. 200 grams or more of ascorbic acid would be tolerated orally without diarrhea. The process of finding what dose will cause diarrhea and will eliminate the acute symptoms, I call titrating to bowel tolerance.“The ascorbate effect is a threshold effect. Symptoms are usually neutralized when a dose of about 90% or more of bowel tolerance is reached with oral ascorbic acid. Intravenous sodium ascorbate is about 2½ times more powerful than ascorbic acid by mouth and since for all practical purposes huge doses of sodium ascorbate are non-toxic, whatever dose necessary to eliminate free radical driven symptoms should be given.”The coronavirus, in acute infections, may be expected to be just as susceptible to vitamin C as all of the other viruses against which it has been proven to be extremely effective. There has never been a documented situation in which sufficiently high dosing with vitamin C has been unable to neutralize or kill any virus against which it has been tested. Even the common cold is a coronavirus. A “new” opportunistic virus is a not a big surprise. History is full of them. Flu Pandemic of 1919-1920. About 10 million soldiers were killed in World War I (1914-1918), charging machine guns and getting mowed down month after month. There were nearly a million casualties at the Somme and another million at Verdun. A terrible slaughter went on for four years. Yet, in just the two years following the war, over 20 million people died from influenza. That is more than twice as many deaths from the flu in one-half the time it took the machine guns.With a century’s worth of accumulated scientific hindsight, we must today ask this: Was a lack of vaccinations really the cause of those flu deaths, or was it really wartime stress, and especially war-induced malnutrition, that set the stage in 1918? And now, once again, we have an alarming and rather similar scenario: between nutrient-poor processed convenience foods, McNothing meals and TV news scare stories, we have the basic ingredients for an epidemic.Influenza is a serious disease, and historically, has been the Reaper’s scythe. There is no way to make light of that. It warrants a closer look at how the medical profession and government have approached different types of influenza. Swine Flu. In the mid-1970s, there was the colossal Swine Flu panic. Here is what the government of the United States said about the infamous Swine Flu vaccine, in a 1976 mass-distributed FDA Consumer Memo on the subject: “Some minor side effects – tenderness in the arm, low fever, tiredness – will occur in less than 4% of (vaccinated) adults. Serious reactions from flu vaccines are very rare.”Many will remember the very numerous and very serious side effects of Swine Flu vaccine that forced the federal immunization program to a halt. So much for blanket claims of safety.As far as being essential, in the same memo the FDA said this of the same vaccine: “Question: What can be done to prevent an epidemic? Answer: The only preventive action we can take is to develop a vaccine to immunize the public against the virus. This will prevent the virus from spreading.”This was seen to be totally false. The public immunization program for Swine Flu was abruptly halted and still there was no epidemic. If vaccination were the only defense, one might expect that tens of millions of Americans would have been struck down with the Swine Flu, for a large percentage of the population of the U.S. was not vaccinated.“Vaccines are being used as an ideological weapon. What you see every year as the flu is caused by 200 or 300 different agents with a vaccine against two of them. That is simply nonsense.” (Tom Jefferson, MD, epidemiologist).Bird Flu. Robert F. Cathcart, MD, writes: “Treatment of the Bird Flu with massive doses of ascorbate would be the same as any other flu except that the severity of the disease indicates that it may take unusually massive doses of ascorbic acid orally or even intravenous sodium ascorbate. (Why the dose needed is somewhat proportional to the severity of the disease being treated is discussed in my paper published in 1981, Titrating to Bowel Tolerance, Anascorbemia, and Acute Induced Scurvy.) I have not seen any flu yet that was not cured or markedly ameliorated by massive doses of vitamin C but it is possible that the bird flu may require even higher doses such as 150 to 300 grams a day. Additionally, this flu could be primarily respiratory. This means that hospitalization might be necessary. If massive doses of ascorbate are not used, they may not be adequate. Most hospitals will not allow adequate doses of ascorbate to be given.Initial oral doses of ascorbic acid should also be massive. I would suggest like 12 grams every 15 minutes until diarrhea is produced. Then, however, doses should be reduced but not much. Listen to your body. If there are many symptoms, keep taking doses that cause a little diarrhea. You do not want constant runs because it is the amount you absorb that is important, not the amount you put in your mouth.”BBC – 9 April 2006: “The chances of bird flu virus mutating into a form that spreads between humans are ‘very low,’ the government’s chief scientific adviser has said. Sir David King said any suggestion a global flu pandemic in humans was inevitable was ‘totally misleading.'” SARS. The coronavirus outbreak in China seems to be due to a virus similar to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which was also a coronavirus. You may remember SARS from 2002. I most certainly do, as I was in Toronto, Canada at the time, smack in the middle of it. I took a lot of vitamin C preventively and had zero symptoms.“The common cold is a coronavirus, and SARS is a coronavirus, so they are the same viral type.” (David Jenkins, MD, Professor of Medicine and Nutritional Science, University of Toronto). Waiting for a vaccine?“We have set up a situation where a fear is created, and then we try to create the treatment for this fear. The public gets the idea that the flu is going to kill them and the vaccine will save them. Neither is true.” (Marc Siegel, MD, author of False Alarm: The Truth About the Epidemic of Fear).Robert F. Cathcart: “All this talk about a vaccine is too late; a waste of time now, especially when we know how to cure the disease already. Every flu I have seen so far (since 1970) has been cured or ameliorated by massive doses of ascorbate. All of these diseases kill by way of free radicals. These free radicals are easily eliminated by massive doses of ascorbate. This is a matter of chemistry, not medicine. The time has come to stop hiding our ability to treat these acute infectious diseases with massive doses of ascorbate.“Ideally, however, in serious cases this disease should be treated first with at least 180 grams or more of sodium ascorbate intravenously every 24 hours running constantly until the fever is broken and most of the symptoms are ameliorated. If after a few hours that rate of administration does not have an obvious ameliorating effect, the rate should be increased.”What dosage?Vitamin C fights all types of viruses. Although the dose should truly be high, even a low supplemental amount of vitamin C saves lives. This is very important for those with low incomes and few treatment options. For example, in one well-controlled, randomized study, just 200 mg/day vitamin C given to the elderly resulted in improvement in respiratory symptoms in the most severely ill, hospitalized patients. And there were 80% fewer deaths in the vitamin C group.\n",
      "But to best build up our immune systems, we need to employ large, orthomolecular doses of several vital nutrients. The physicians on the Orthomolecular Medicine News Service review board specifically recommend at least 3000 milligrams (or more) of vitamin C daily, in divided doses. Vitamin C empowers the immune system and can directly denature many viruses. It can be taken as ascorbic acid (which is sour like vinegar), either in capsules or as crystals dissolved in water or juice. It can also be taken as sodium ascorbate, which is non-acidic. To be most effective, it should be taken to bowel tolerance. This means taking high doses several (or many) times each day. See the references below for more information.Nebulized hydrogen peroxide. Thomas E. Levy, MD: “Viral syndromes start or are strongly supported by ongoing viral replication in the naso- and oropharynx. When appropriate agents are nebulized (into a fine spray) and this viral presence is quickly eliminated, the rest of the body “mops up” quite nicely the rest of the viral presence. The worst viral infections are continually fed and sustained by the viral growth in the pharynx. Probably the best and most accessible agent to nebulize would be 3% hydrogen peroxide for 15 to 30 minutes several times daily.” An example of successful treatment by ascorbate: “Chikungunya is a viral illness characterized by severe joint pains, which may persist for months to years. There is no effective treatment for this disease. We treated 56 patients with moderate to severe persistent pains with a single infusion of ascorbic acid ranging from 25-50 grams and hydrogen peroxide (3 cc of a 3% solution) from July to October 2014. Patients were asked about their pain using the Verbal Numerical Rating Scale-11 immediately before and after treatment. The mean Pain Score before and after treatment was 8 and 2 respectively (60%) (p < 0.001); and 5 patients (9%) had a Pain Score of 0. The use of intravenous ascorbic acid and hydrogen peroxide resulted in a statistically significant reduction of pain in patients with moderate to severe pain from the Chikungunya virus immediately after treatment.”Available evidence indicates that supplementation with multiple micronutrients with immune-supporting roles may modulate immune function and reduce the risk of infection. Micronutrients with the strongest evidence for immune support are vitamins C and D and zinc.Additional recommended nutrients. Magnesium: 400 mg daily (in citrate, malate, chelate, or chloride form). Many people are deficient in magnesium, because modern agriculture often does not supply adequate magnesium in the soil, and food processing removes magnesium. It is an extremely important nutrient that is essential for hundreds of biochemical pathways. A blood test for magnesium cannot correctly diagnose a deficiency. A long-term deficiency of magnesium can build up in the body that may take 6 months to a year of higher than normal doses to replete.A very cheap and highly beneficial adjunct for any acute infection, especially viral, is oral magnesium chloride. Amazingly, just as intravenous vitamin C has been shown to cure polio, an oral magnesium chloride regimen has been shown to do the same thing, as or even more effectively than the vitamin C.Mix 25 grams MgCl2 in a quart of water. Depending on body size (tiny infant to an adult), give 15 to 125 ml of this solution four times daily. If the taste is too salty/bitter, a favorite juice can be added.Vitamin D3: 2000 International Units daily. (Start with 5000 IU/day for two weeks, then reduce to 2000). Vitamin D is stored in the body for long periods but takes a long time to reach an effective level. If you are deficient (e.g. if you haven’t taken vitamin D and it’s near the end of winter when the sun is low in the sky) you can start by taking larger than normal doses for 2 weeks to build up the level quickly. The maintenance dose varies with body weight, 400-1000 IU/day for children and 2000-5000 IU/day for adults.William Grant, PhD, says: “Coronaviruses cause pneumonia as does influenza. A study of the case-fatality rate from the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic in the United States showed that most deaths were due to pneumonia. The SARS-coronavirus and the current China coronavirus were both most common in winter, when vitamin D status is lowest.”“I have found the value of bolstering immune function with Vitamin D to be incredibly powerful.” (Dr. Jeffrey Allyn Ruterbusch). Zinc is a powerful antioxidant and is essential for many biochemical pathways. It has been shown to be effective in helping the body fight infections. [2021] A recommended dose is 20-40 mg/day for adults. Selenium: 100 mcg (micrograms) daily. Selenium is an essential nutrient and an important antioxidant that can help to fight infections. Dr. Damien Downing says: “Swine flu, bird flu and SARS (another coronavirus) all developed in selenium-deficient areas of China; Ebola and HIV in Selenium-deficient areas of Sub-Saharan Africa. This is because the same oxidative stress that causes us inflammation forces viruses to mutate rapidly in order to survive. ‘When Se-deficient virus-infected hosts were supplemented with dietary Se, viral mutation rates diminished and immunocompetence improved.'”B-complex vitamins and vitamin A: A multivitamin tablet with each meal will supply these conveniently and economically. Nutritional supplements are not just a good idea. For fighting viruses, they are absolutely essential.How to Treat Coronavirus Without Drugs\n",

      "Two days ago, a paper published in the Biorxiv.org journal presented findings that indicated the coronavirus appeared to be engineered with “key structural proteins” of HIV. The paper, entitled, “Uncanny similarity of unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV spike protein to HIV-1 gp120\n",
      "and Gag,” concluded that the engineering of coronavirus with such gene sequences was “unlikely to be fortuitous in nature,” providing strong scientific support for the theory that the coronavirus is an engineered bioweapon that escaped laboratory containment in China. The coverage of this paper by Zero Hedge led to a firestorm of denials by governments, health authorities and the CIA-controlled media, not surprisingly. Any suggestion that the coronavirus was engineered as a bioweapon had to be immediately eliminated. The prevailing panic by the establishment sought to blame this outbreak on Mother Nature — i.e. bats, snakes, seafood, etc. — rather than the human beings who are playing around with deadly biological weapons that are designed to extinguish human life. Within hours, Twitter slapped down a permanent ban on Zero Hedge, making sure the independent publisher could no longer reach its Twitter audience. After all, the first casualty in any pandemic is the truth, and Jack Dorsey is not only an enabler of pedophiles and child rapists, he’s also an authoritarian tyrant who wants to make sure the public is completely isolated from any “non official” reports about this pandemic. (Jack Dorsey has sided with communist China, in other words. Is anyone surprised?) Under the intense pressure, the authors of the original paper have now withdrawn the paper and intend to revise it. The publication that originally carried the paper now has a warning message stating, “This article has been withdrawn. Click here for details.” (See original source link here.) No doubt the authors of this particular paper have been sufficiently threatened to revise their conclusions, and an update of their original paper will soon be posted that effectively denounces everything they stated in the original paper. The criminal wing of the science establishment strikes again, of course, and this tactic of threatening scientists with loss of funding, being blacklisted or even physically threatened and killed is not unusual at all. The CDC, NIH and even the EPA have long histories of threatening scientists with being harmed or killed if they don’t fall in line with the prevailing lies of the establishment. In some cases, they’ve even imprisoned scientists for fraud after those individuals refused to retract their papers. This has been especially common in research areas such as HIV / AIDS, pandemics and vaccines. Any scientist who finds fault with the establishment is destroyed, imprisoned or murdered. In fact, I’ve interviewed one of the science victims of this, named Judy Mikovits, PhD. Watch my full interview here, but keep reading below first, because there’s a lot more to this story that will shock you: Now, stunning new evidence has emerged that proves the coronavirus was definitely engineered in a laboratory and may have been deliberately injected into patients as part of a Chinese vaccine experiment gone wrong. As detailed by James Lyons-Weiler, PhD, founder of the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge and author of 57 peer-reviewed publications, an analysis of the gene sequence for the coronavirus finds a peculiar sequence called “pShuttle-SN.” This sequence is is the remnant of a genetic engineering sequence that’s used to insert genes into viruses and bacteria. It provides irrefutable “open source” proof that the coronavirus now circulating in the wild was engineered in a laboratory. Every lab that has the gene sequence can see this for themselves. It’s right out in the open, which is why we describe this revelation as “open source.” “One thing we can say for certain is that this particular virus has a laboratory origin,” states Lyons-Weiler in a bombshell interview with Del Bigtree of The Highwire (see video below, via Brighteon.com, since the video would be banned everywhere else). This genomic evidence does not, however, prove whether it was produced as a bioweapon or as a vaccine experiment. It could be either one, according to Lyons-Weiler: In fact, if you then take that sequence and compare it to other proteins, we find that it’s actually a SARS protein that was put into a coronavirus for the purpose of making the vaccine work better. That’s why this element is in there, to create a more reactogenic vaccine. There’s bombshell after bombshell in this interview, especially at the 27:59 and 33:57 marks. Watch it exclusively at Brighteon.com, given that this information is of course being banned everywhere else by the anti-human tech giants, all of which are now siding with communist China to cover up the truth: If it was a vaccine experiment gone wrong, then the world is in real trouble, warns analyst Why does it matter whether the origin was a Chinese vaccine experiment vs. a bioweapon? As previous research has revealed, when these SARS insertions into the coronavirus are introduced into animal as part of a vaccine, they create heightened fatalities when patients are exposed to other coronavirus strains. In effect, being vaccinated with this particular strain of coronavirus causes individuals to be more easily killed by the common cold and other non-pandemic coronavirus strains that are circulating in the wild. Tech giants now working over time to cover it all up, censor all dissenting views, and reinforce communist China’s official lies As expected, the evil tech giants are working overtime to squelch any dissenting views and protect the vaccine industry as well as the bioweapons industry. No blame can be allowed to fall on either one. Instead, Mother Nature must be blamed for all this. And that means the truth must be silenced… a strategy that is, of course, routine for the vaccine industry. Every channel, voice or website now exploring any human origins of this coronavirus strain — whether related to vaccines or bioweapons — is being rapidly de-platformed and attacked. In some cases, websites are being sabotaged and taken offline, as happened with Natural News last week (we have since recovered, which is why you are able to read this). Yet the anti-human tech giants are unified in their efforts to silence all information that contradicts official lies, no matter how scientifically accurate that information may be. Watch this important video to learn more about Big Tech and how it ran a simulation — complete with fake news censorship highlights — to play out the exact scenario we’re all witnessing now: A global pandemic of human origin, infecting tens of thousands of people, accompanied by a government cover-upNew evidence: Coronavirus “bioweapon” might have been a Chinese vaccine experiment gone wrong… genes contain “pShuttle-SN” sequences, proving laboratory origin\n",

      "In 2019, a mysterious shipment sent from Canada to China was found to contain hidden coronavirus, which Chinese agents working at a Canadian laboratory reportedly stole, obviously without permission.Reports reveal that these Chinese agents were working undercover for the Chinese Biological Warfare Program, and may have infiltrated North America for the sole purpose of hijacking this deadly virus in order to unleash it at a later date.That unleashing could be the coronavirus outbreak that’s currently dominating media headlines – with as many as 44000 people now infected – despite blame being assigned to contaminated food sold at the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan, China – and here’s why.It was back on June 13, 2012, when a 60-year-old man from Saudi Arabia was admitted to a private hospital in Jeddah with a seven-day affliction of fever, cough, expectoration and shortness of breath. The man had no known history of cardiopulmonary or renal disease, was on no medications, and didn’t smoke, and tests revealed that he had become infected with a previously unknown strain of coronavirus.However, tests could not reveal where the man had contracted coronavirus. So, Dr. Ali Mohamed Zaki, the Egyptian virologist who was caring for the man, contacted Ron Fouchier, a premier virologist at the Erasmus Medical Center (EMC) in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, for advice.Fouchier proceeded to sequence a sample of the virus sent to him by Dr. Zaki using a broad-spectrum “pan-coronavirus” real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method to distinguish it from other strains of coronavirus. He then sent it to Dr. Frank Plummer, the Scientific Director of Canada’s National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) in Winnipeg, on May 4, 2013, where it was replicated for assessment and diagnostic purposes.Scientists in Winnipeg proceeded to test this strain of coronavirus on animals to see which species could catch it. This research was done in conjunction with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency’s national lab, as well as with the National Centre for Foreign Animal Diseases, which is in the same complex as the National Microbiology Laboratory (NML).NML, it’s important to note, has long conducted tests with coronavirus, having isolated and provided the first genome sequence of the SARS coronavirus. This lab had also identified another type of coronavirus, known as NL63, back in 2004.Formerly respected scientist allowed multiple deadly viruses besides coronavirus to be shipped to China. Fast-forward to today, and the recent discovery of the mystery shipment containing coronavirus can be traced all the way back to these samples that were sent to Canada for analysis, suggesting that the current coronavirus outbreak was likely stolen as a bioweapon to be released for just such a time as this.According to reports, the shipment occurred back in March of 2019, which caused a major scandal with biowarfare experts who questioned why Canada was purportedly sending lethal viruses to China. It was later discovered in July that Chinese virologists had stolen. it, and were forcibly dispatched as a result.\n",
      "“The NML is Canada’s only level-4 facility and one of only a few in North America equipped to handle the world’s deadliest diseases, including Ebola, SARS, Coronavirus, etc.,” explains a report by Great Game India, as republished by Zero Hedge.“The NML scientist who was escorted out of the Canadian lab along with her husband, another biologist, and members of her research team is believed to be a Chinese Bio-Warfare agent Xiangguo Qiu,” it goes on to explain, adding that Qiu had served as head of the Vaccine Development and Antiviral Therapies Section of the Special Pathogens Program at Canada’s NML.A formerly respected scientist in China, Qiu began studying powerful viruses in 2006. In 2014, many of these viruses she studied, including not only coronavirus but also Machupo, Junin, Rift Valley Fever, Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever, and Hendra, all suddenly appeared in China as part of a massive hijacking.Be sure to read the full report at ZeroHedge.com.You can also keep up with the latest coronavirus news by visiting Outbreak.news.Is coronavirus a manufactured bioweapon that Chinese spies stole from Canada?\n",

      "Abundant clinical evidence confirms vitamin C's powerful antiviral effect when used in sufficient quantity. Treating influenza with very large amounts of vitamin C is not a new idea at all. Frederick R. Klenner, MD, and Robert F. Cathcart, MD, successfully used this approach for decades. Frequent oral dosing with vitamin C sufficient to reach a daily bowel tolerance limit will work for most persons. Intravenous vitamin C is indicated for the most serious cases.Bowel tolerance levels of vitamin C, taken as divided doses all throughout the day, are a clinically proven antiviral without equal. Vitamin C can be used alone or right along with medicines if one so chooses.\"Some physicians would stand by and see their patients die rather than use ascorbic acid. Vitamin C should be given to the patient while the doctors ponder the diagnosis.\" (Frederick R. Klenner, MD, chest specialist).Dr. Robert Cathcart advocated treating influenza with up to 150000 milligrams of vitamin C daily, often intravenously. You and I can, to some extent, simulate a 24 hour IV of vitamin C by taking it by mouth very, very often. When I had pneumonia, it took 2000 mg of vitamin C every six minutes, by the clock, to get me to saturation. My oral daily dose was over 100000 mg. Fever, cough and other symptoms were reduced in hours; complete recovery took just a few days. That is performance at least as good as any pharmaceutical will give, and the vitamin is both safer and cheaper. Many physicians consider high doses of vitamin C to be so powerful an antiviral that it may be ranked as a functional immunization for a variety influenza strains.Dr. Cathcart writes:\"The sicker a person was, the more ascorbic acid they would tolerate orally without it causing diarrhea. In a person with an otherwise normal GI tract when they were well, would tolerate 5 to 15 grams of ascorbic acid orally in divided doses without diarrhea. With a mild cold 30 to 60 grams; with a bad cold, 100 grams; with a flu, 150 grams; and with mononucleosis, viral pneumonia, etc. 200 grams or more of ascorbic acid would be tolerated orally without diarrhea. The process of finding what dose will cause diarrhea and will eliminate the acute symptoms, I call titrating to bowel tolerance.\"The ascorbate effect is a threshold effect. Symptoms are usually neutralized when a dose of about 90% or more of bowel tolerance is reached with oral ascorbic acid. Intravenous sodium ascorbate is about 2½ times more powerful than ascorbic acid by mouth and since for all practical purposes huge doses of sodium ascorbate are non-toxic, whatever dose necessary to eliminate free radical driven symptoms should be given.\"The coronavirus, in acute infections, may be expected to be just as susceptible to vitamin C as all of the other viruses against which it has been proven to be extremely effective. There has never been a documented situation in which sufficiently high dosing with vitamin C has been unable to neutralize or kill any virus against which it has been tested.Even the common cold is a coronavirus. A \"new\" opportunistic virus is a not a big surprise. History is full of them.Flu Pandemic of 1919-1920. About 10 million soldiers were killed in World War I (1914-1918), charging machine guns and getting mowed down month after month. There were nearly a million casualties at the Somme and another million at Verdun. A terrible slaughter went on for four years. Yet, in just the two years following the war, over 20 million people died from influenza. That is more than twice as many deaths from the flu in one-half the time it took the machine guns.With a century's worth of accumulated scientific hindsight, we must today ask this: Was a lack of vaccinations really the cause of those flu deaths, or was it really wartime stress, and especially war-induced malnutrition, that set the stage in 1918? And now, once again, we have an alarming and rather similar scenario: between nutrient-poor processed convenience foods, McNothing meals and TV news scare stories, we have the basic ingredients for an epidemic.\n",
      "Influenza is a serious disease, and historically, has been the Reaper's scythe. There is no way to make light of that. It warrants a closer look at how the medical profession and government have approached different types of influenza.In the mid-1970s, there was the colossal Swine Flu panic. Here is what the government of the United States said about the infamous Swine Flu vaccine, in a 1976 mass-distributed FDA Consumer Memo on the subject:\"Some minor side effects - tenderness in the arm, low fever, tiredness - will occur in less than 4% of (vaccinated) adults. Serious reactions from flu vaccines are very rare.\"Many will remember the very numerous and very serious side effects of Swine Flu vaccine that forced the federal immunization program to a halt. So much for blanket claims of safety.As far as being essential, in the same memo the FDA said this of the same vaccine:\"Question: What can be done to prevent an epidemic? Answer: The only preventive action we can take is to develop a vaccine to immunize the public against the virus. This will prevent the virus from spreading.\"This was seen to be totally false. The public immunization program for Swine Flu was abruptly halted and still there was no epidemic. If vaccination were the only defense, one might expect that tens of millions of Americans would have been struck down with the Swine Flu, for a large percentage of the population of the U.S. was not vaccinated.\"Vaccines are being used as an ideological weapon. What you see every year as the flu is caused by 200 or 300 different agents with a vaccine against two of them. That is simply nonsense.\" (Tom Jefferson, MD, epidemiologist).Robert F. Cathcart, MD, writes: \"Treatment of the Bird Flu with massive doses of ascorbate would be the same as any other flu except that the severity of the disease indicates that it may take unusually massive doses of ascorbic acid orally or even intravenous sodium ascorbate. (Why the dose needed is somewhat proportional to the severity of the disease being treated is discussed in my paper published in 1981, Titrating to Bowel Tolerance, Anascorbemia, and Acute Induced Scurvy.) I have not seen any flu yet that was not cured or markedly ameliorated by massive doses of vitamin C but it is possible that the bird flu may require even higher doses such as 150 to 300 grams a day. Additionally, this flu could be primarily respiratory. This means that hospitalization might be necessary. If massive doses of ascorbate are not used, they may not be adequate. Most hospitals will not allow adequate doses of ascorbate to be given.\n",
      "\"Initial oral doses of ascorbic acid should also be massive. I would suggest like 12 grams every 15 minutes until diarrhea is produced. Then, however, doses should be reduced but not much. Listen to your body. If there are many symptoms, keep taking doses that cause a little diarrhea. You do not want constant runs because it is the amount you absorb that is important, not the amount you put in your mouth.\"BBC - 9 April 2006: \"The chances of bird flu virus mutating into a form that spreads between humans are 'very low,' the government's chief scientific adviser has said. Sir David King said any suggestion a global flu pandemic in humans was inevitable was 'totally misleading.'\"The coronavirus outbreak in China seems to be due to a virus similar to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which was also a coronavirus. You may remember SARS from 2002. I most certainly do, as I was in Toronto, Canada at the time, smack in the middle of it. I took a lot of vitamin C preventively and had zero symptoms.\"The common cold is a coronavirus, and SARS is a coronavirus, so they are the same viral type.\" (David Jenkins, MD, Professor of Medicine and Nutritional Science, University of Toronto). Waiting for a vaccine?\"We have set up a situation where a fear is created, and then we try to create the treatment for this fear. The public gets the idea that the flu is going to kill them and the vaccine will save them. Neither is true.\" (Marc Siegel, MD, author of False Alarm: The Truth About the Epidemic of Fear). Robert F. Cathcart: \"All this talk about a vaccine is too late; a waste of time now, especially when we know how to cure the disease already. Every flu I have seen so far (since 1970) has been cured or ameliorated by massive doses of ascorbate. All of these diseases kill by way of free radicals. These free radicals are easily eliminated by massive doses of ascorbate. This is a matter of chemistry, not medicine. The time has come to stop hiding our ability to treat these acute infectious diseases with massive doses of ascorbate.\"Ideally, however, in serious cases this disease should be treated first with at least 180 grams or more of sodium ascorbate intravenously every 24 hours running constantly until the fever is broken and most of the symptoms are ameliorated. If after a few hours that rate of administration does not have an obvious ameliorating effect, the rate should be increased.\"What dosage?Vitamin C fights all types of viruses. Although the dose should truly be high, even a low supplemental amount of vitamin C saves lives. This is very important for those with low incomes and few treatment options. For example, in one well-controlled, randomized study, just 200 mg/day vitamin C given to the elderly resulted in improvement in respiratory symptoms in the most severely ill, hospitalized patients. And there were 80% fewer deaths in the vitamin C group.\n",
      "But to best build up our immune systems, we need to employ large, orthomolecular doses of several vital nutrients. The physicians on the Orthomolecular Medicine News Service review board specifically recommend at least 3000 milligrams (or more) of vitamin C daily, in divided doses. Vitamin C empowers the immune system and can directly denature many viruses. It can be taken as ascorbic acid (which is sour like vinegar), either in capsules or as crystals dissolved in water or juice. It can also be taken as sodium ascorbate, which is non-acidic. To be most effective, it should be taken to bowel tolerance. This means taking high doses several (or many) times each day. See the references below for more information.Nebulized hydrogen peroxide. Thomas E. Levy, MD: \"Viral syndromes start or are strongly supported by ongoing viral replication in the naso- and oropharynx. When appropriate agents are nebulized (into a fine spray) and this viral presence is quickly eliminated, the rest of the body \"mops up\" quite nicely the rest of the viral presence. The worst viral infections are continually fed and sustained by the viral growth in the pharynx. Probably the best and most accessible agent to nebulize would be 3% hydrogen peroxide for 15 to 30 minutes several times daily.\"An example of successful treatment by ascorbate:\"Chikungunya is a viral illness characterized by severe joint pains, which may persist for months to years. There is no effective treatment for this disease. We treated 56 patients with moderate to severe persistent pains with a single infusion of ascorbic acid ranging from 25-50 grams and hydrogen peroxide (3 cc of a 3% solution) from July to October 2014. Patients were asked about their pain using the Verbal Numerical Rating Scale-11 immediately before and after treatment. The mean Pain Score before and after treatment was 8 and 2 respectively (60%) (p < 0.001); and 5 patients (9%) had a Pain Score of 0. The use of intravenous ascorbic acid and hydrogen peroxide resulted in a statistically significant reduction of pain in patients with moderate to severe pain from the Chikungunya virus immediately after treatment.\"Available evidence indicates that supplementation with multiple micronutrients with immune-supporting roles may modulate immune function and reduce the risk of infection. Micronutrients with the strongest evidence for immune support are vitamins C and D and zinc.Additional recommended nutrients. Magnesium: 400 mg daily (in citrate, malate, chelate, or chloride form). Many people are deficient in magnesium, because modern agriculture often does not supply adequate magnesium in the soil, and food processing removes magnesium. It is an extremely important nutrient that is essential for hundreds of biochemical pathways. A blood test for magnesium cannot correctly diagnose a deficiency. A long-term deficiency of magnesium can build up in the body that may take 6 months to a year of higher than normal doses to replete.A very cheap and highly beneficial adjunct for any acute infection, especially viral, is oral magnesium chloride. Amazingly, just as intravenous vitamin C has been shown to cure polio, an oral magnesium chloride regimen has been shown to do the same thing, as or even more effectively than the vitamin C.\n",
      "Mix 25 grams MgCl2 in a quart of water. Depending on body size (tiny infant to an adult), give 15 to 125 ml of this solution four times daily. If the taste is too salty/bitter, a favorite juice can be added.Vitamin D3: 2000 International Units daily. (Start with 5000 IU/day for two weeks, then reduce to 2000). Vitamin D is stored in the body for long periods but takes a long time to reach an effective level. If you are deficient (e.g. if you haven't taken vitamin D and it's near the end of winter when the sun is low in the sky) you can start by taking larger than normal doses for 2 weeks to build up the level quickly. The maintenance dose varies with body weight, 400-1000 IU/day for children and 2000-5000 IU/day for adults.William Grant, PhD, says: \"Coronaviruses cause pneumonia as does influenza. A study of the case-fatality rate from the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic in the United States showed that most deaths were due to pneumonia. The SARS-coronavirus and the current China coronavirus were both most common in winter, when vitamin D status is lowest.\"\"I have found the value of bolstering immune function with Vitamin D to be incredibly powerful.\" Zinc is a powerful antioxidant and is essential for many biochemical pathways. It has been shown to be effective in helping the body fight infections. [2021] A recommended dose is 20-40 mg/day for adults.Selenium: 100 mcg (micrograms) daily. Selenium is an essential nutrient and an important antioxidant that can help to fight infections. Dr. Damien Downing says: \"Swine flu, bird flu and SARS (another coronavirus) all developed in selenium-deficient areas of China; Ebola and HIV in Selenium-deficient areas of Sub-Saharan Africa. This is because the same oxidative stress that causes us inflammation forces viruses to mutate rapidly in order to survive. 'When Se-deficient virus-infected hosts were supplemented with dietary Se, viral mutation rates diminished and immunocompetence improved.'\"B-complex vitamins and vitamin A: A multivitamin tablet with each meal will supply these conveniently and economically.Nutritional supplements are not just a good idea.

      "In 2019, a mysterious shipment sent from Canada to China was found to contain hidden coronavirus, which Chinese agents working at a Canadian laboratory reportedly stole, obviously without permission.Reports reveal that these Chinese agents were working undercover for the Chinese Biological Warfare Program, and may have infiltrated North America for the sole purpose of hijacking this deadly virus in order to unleash it at a later date.That unleashing could be the coronavirus outbreak that’s currently dominating media headlines – with as many as 44000 people now infected – despite blame being assigned to contaminated food sold at the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan, China – and here’s why.It was back on June 13, 2012, when a 60-year-old man from Saudi Arabia was admitted to a private hospital in Jeddah with a seven-day affliction of fever, cough, expectoration and shortness of breath. The man had no known history of cardiopulmonary or renal disease, was on no medications, and didn’t smoke, and tests revealed that he had become infected with a previously unknown strain of coronavirus.However, tests could not reveal where the man had contracted coronavirus. So, Dr. Ali Mohamed Zaki, the Egyptian virologist who was caring for the man, contacted Ron Fouchier, a premier virologist at the Erasmus Medical Center (EMC) in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, for advice.Fouchier proceeded to sequence a sample of the virus sent to him by Dr. Zaki using a broad-spectrum “pan-coronavirus” real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method to distinguish it from other strains of coronavirus. He then sent it to Dr. Frank Plummer, the Scientific Director of Canada’s National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) in Winnipeg, on May 4, 2013, where it was replicated for assessment and diagnostic purposes.\n",
      "Scientists in Winnipeg proceeded to test this strain of coronavirus on animals to see which species could catch it. This research was done in conjunction with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency’s national lab, as well as with the National Centre for Foreign Animal Diseases, which is in the same complex as the National Microbiology Laboratory (NML).NML, it’s important to note, has long conducted tests with coronavirus, having isolated and provided the first genome sequence of the SARS coronavirus. This lab had also identified another type of coronavirus, known as NL63, back in 2004.Formerly respected scientist allowed multiple deadly viruses besides coronavirus to be shipped to China.Fast-forward to today, and the recent discovery of the mystery shipment containing coronavirus can be traced all the way back to these samples that were sent to Canada for analysis, suggesting that the current coronavirus outbreak was likely stolen as a bioweapon to be released for just such a time as this.\n",
      "According to reports, the shipment occurred back in March of 2019, which caused a major scandal with biowarfare experts who questioned why Canada was purportedly sending lethal viruses to China. It was later discovered in July that Chinese virologists had stolen it, and were forcibly dispatched as a result.\n",
      "“The NML is Canada’s only level-4 facility and one of only a few in North America equipped to handle the world’s deadliest diseases, including Ebola, SARS, Coronavirus, etc.,” explains a report by Great Game India, as republished by Zero Hedge.“The NML scientist who was escorted out of the Canadian lab along with her husband, another biologist, and members of her research team is believed to be a Chinese Bio-Warfare agent Xiangguo Qiu,” it goes on to explain, adding that Qiu had served as head of the Vaccine Development and Antiviral Therapies Section of the Special Pathogens Program at Canada’s NML.A formerly respected scientist in China, Qiu began studying powerful viruses in 2006. In 2014, many of these viruses she studied, including not only coronavirus but also Machupo, Junin, Rift Valley Fever, Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever, and Hendra, all suddenly appeared in China as part of a massive hijacking.\n",

      "On 29 January WHO Director-General, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that there was no reason to declare the outbreak of the coronavirus 2019-nCoV in China a pandemic risk. On 30 January, he declared the virus an international emergency, but made clear that there was no reason for countries to issue travel-advisories against travelling to China. Let me speculate – the ‘international emergency’ was declared at the request of Washington, and the comment against the travel-advisory was an addition by Dr. Tedros himself, as he realized that there was indeed no reason for panic, that China is doing wonders in stemming the virus from spreading and in detecting the virus early on.In fact, Dr. Tedros has himself, as well as other high-ranking WHO officials, on various occasions praised China for her effort to contain the virus, the speed with which Wuhan (population of 11 million, capital of the center-eastern Province of Hubei) and China as a whole has reacted to the outbreak. The latest achievement – in 8 days China has built in Wuhan a 25000 m2 special hospital for treatment of the coronavirus 2019-nCoV and possible mutations, with 1000 beds, and for about 1400 medical personnel, for a budget of the equivalent of US$ 43 million – equipped with state-of-the-art medical technology. No other country in the world would have been capable of such an achievement.Nevertheless, and against WHO’s guidance, Washington immediately advised its citizens not to travel to China, and withdrew non-essential staff from US consulates and the Embassy in Beijing, thereby triggering an avalanche of similar reactions among Washington vassals around the globe – i.e. most of the European countries did likewise, many of them canceled their flights to China, as did of course the US.Russia also closed her 4200 km long border, working hand-in-hand with China in containing the virus. This also means that no infected Russian citizen may leave China. This is a concerted Chinese-Russian effort – spearheaded by China – to control and contain the epidemic.The NYT and WashPo are on a vicious daily campaign to slander and vilify China with lies and manipulated information on how badly China is managing the disease, when the complete opposite is the case. Compare this to the common flu epidemic, that hits the US and most of the western countries, despite the fact that the US and Europe have virtually implemented carpet vaccination (in some US States and EU countries even compulsory).Yet, this 2019 / 2020 flu season which is far from over, has so far claimed more than 8400 lives alone in the US, more than 140000 hospitalizations and more than 8 million infected people. The US has about 330 million people. Compare this to China’s 1.4 billion population – with, as of 3 February, an infection rate of less than 21000, a death toll of 425 in China, and outside of China reported two, one in Hong Kong, another one in the Philippines.Expand these statistics to Europe and you find similar figures. Of course, nobody talks about it. This is an annual occurrence – a bonanza for the western pharma industry. In the west, disease is business. The more the merrier. Once you are in the “medical mill”, it’s difficult to escape. “Specialists’ find always another reason to send you yet to another “specialist” – for another treatment. The ignorant patient has no option than to obey – after all its his health and life. In China it is the total opposite. The Chinese system does everything for its population’s health and well-being.The Coronavirus Epidemic: Chinese Resilience and Silent, Simple and Steady Resistance – A Model for Mankind.Yet, China bashing in one way or another seems to intensify by the day. Yesterday, 3 February, the UN in Geneva has issued an edict that all UN employees returning from China must stay home and work from home for 14 days, i.e. a dictated self-quarantine. And new contracts for Chinese staff will be temporarily suspended. This is all propaganda against China.Quarantine is absolutely not necessary. Chinese biologists of the Office of Science and Technology of the city of Wuxi (south-eastern Jiangsu province, near Shanghai) have developed a test kit that can detect the 2019-nCoV virus within 8 – 15 minutes, similar to a pregnancy test. This test kit is available to the world. In fact, it has been used to test an airline crew member arriving from New York at the Zurich airport and feeling ill. Within less than an hour, the crew member was sent home – it was the common flu.In China, where by now scientific evidence is mounting that the disease – like all the coronaviral diseases, including the 2019-nCoV predecessor SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, 2002 / 2003 also in China), and its Middle East equivalent, MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) are not only laboratory fabricated, but also patented. And so are many others, for example, Ebola and HIV. Both, SARS and 2019-nCoV are not only man-made, but they are also focusing on the Chinese race. That’s why you find very few people infected in the 18 countries where the coronavirus has spread.It sounds like a strange coincidence that in October 2019 a simulation with precisely the coronavirus was carried out at the John Hopkins Institute in the US, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the WEF (World Economic Forum), as well as the Pirbright Institute of the UK, one of the world’s few level 4 (highest security level) bio-warfare laboratories (for more details see “China’s Coronavirus: A Global Health Emergency is Launched. What are the Facts”).The west’s ‘demolition’ priority seems to have shifted drastically from Russia to China. Why? – Because China is an ever-stronger economic power, soon to surpass the United States in absolute terms. Since mid-2017, China is already number one, measured by the PPP (Purchasing Power Parity) indicator, indeed the most important one, because it demonstrates what people can actually buy with the money.China’s currency, the Yuan, is also advancing rapidly as a reserve currency, gradually replacing the US-dollar. When that happens, that real money, like the Chinese Yuan, based on a hard economy and covered by gold, against a “fake” fiat currency (based on nothing), like the US-dollar, is taking the lead, then the US-dollar hegemony is broken and the US economy doomed.To prevent that from happening Washington is doing everything possible to destabilize China – see Hong Kong, Taiwan, the Uyghurs in China’s western Xinjiang Province, Tibet, the infamous Trump-inspired “tariff war” – and now the new coronavirus outbreak. The death toll is at present about 2.1% (of total cases of infection), down from 2.3% a week ago.But that and the constant bashing with negative western propaganda, travel bans, border closures, flight bans – and more – plus the disease itself, the medical care, work absenteeism, medication and medical equipment, not to forget the specially-built 1000-bed emergency hospital in Wuhan – and an 8% average decline at the Shanghai stock exchange, bear a considerable economic cost for China. So much so, that the People’s Bank of China (PBC) has recently injected some 1.2 billion yuan (about US$ 174 million equivalent) into the economy.This new coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, may just be a trial. Imagine a stronger mutation of a coronavirus would be implanted into the Chinese population, say with a mortality rate of 10% to 20% or higher – it could cause real havoc. However, a stronger version may not be so easily controllable and directable – i.e. towards the Chinese race – and may risk spreading to the Caucasian race as well – meaning the executioner would risk committing mass suicide.Remember the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918, the deadliest in history, infected an estimated 500 million people worldwide – at that time about one-third of the planet’s population – and killed at least 50 million people (a death rate of 10%), including some 700000 Americans.While preparing for the worst, because Washington – with the help of its level 4 bio-war lab –  will not let go easily, China’s approach of endless inventive creation, avoiding conflicts, will outlive the aggressor.China – Western China Bashing – vs. Western Biowarfare?\n",

      "Maybe it was a plan that went horribly wrong, something they could no longer control. Was the Corona virus or COVID-19 spread intentionally? What if this virus was used against China as a weapon of choice to destabilize China’s economy and push back against China’s growing influence? We don’t know for sure, but it is possible. Investigations are ongoing. Nothing has not been confirmed.But what has been confirmed is what history has taught us given the facts on how the use of biological warfare for various purposes, against many peoples and nations has been happening for some time. One of the most well-known incidents of biological warfare occurred in 1763, the British Empire had planned and successfully managed to spread smallpox virus to the Native Americans during the Pontiac Rebellion in Pennsylvania. Chief Pontiac of the Ottawa launched an attack on Fort Detroit, a British military base. Other nations joined the rebellion including the Senecas, the Hurons, Delawares, and Miamis. As the war raged, an Indian delegation asked the British to surrender, but they refused, however, the British offered gifts including food, alcohol and material items that included two blankets and a handkerchief from people who had smallpox. Although the American Indians had experienced the disease in the past, the idea was to spread the disease among the Native American populations in an attempt to push back the rebellion or to defeat it once and for all.Another example of biological warfare was when Imperial Japan before and during World War II had a bio-weapons program that managed to drop numerous bombs on a number of Chinese cities from airplanes killing an estimated 580000 Chinese people with bombs that were made of infected fleas, some even contained cholera and shigella during the Sino-Japanese war between the 1930′s and 1940′s.In 1981, the CIA with help from U.S. military had launched an operation against Cuba by unleashing a strain of Dengue Fever also known as “hemorrhagic fever’ effecting more than 273000 people killing 158 including 101 children. On September 6, 1981, The New York Times reported on Fidel Castro’s comments regarding the U.S. government in particularly, blaming the CIA for the outbreak when he said that”we urge the United States Government to define its policy in this field, to say whether the C.I.A. will or will not be authorized again- or has already been authorized – to organize attacks against leaders of the revolution and to use plagues against our plants, our animals and our people.”The report said that the“epidemic of dengue fever that has made 340000 people ill and has killed about 150″ but the State Department under-then President Ronald Reagan stated that “Mr. Castro’s charges of possible United States involvement in the epidemic were ”totally without foundation.” The State department quickly blamed the Castro’s revolution as a failure:The Geopolitical Deployment of Biological Weapons.The Cuban Government has always tried to blame the United States for its failures and its internal problems,” the department said. ”The Cuban revolution is a failure, and it is obviously easier to blame external forces like the United States than to admit those failures”.Dr, Ronald St. John, chief of communicable diseases for the Pan American Health Organization was interviewed by the New York Times said that “for the first time, so-called dengue-2 spread to Cuba.” Dr. St. John claimed that it is common in Southeast Asia and that it produces.“the same symptoms as the other three” and that ”if you get a wave of dengue-1, dengue-3 or dengue-4 and then another wave of type 2, this is a bad combination.”Dengue-2 causes you too loose body fluids causing shocks that can lead to eventually death. Convenient for the CIA who saw it as an opportunity to cause panic on Cuba which is located in one of the most hot and humid regions in the world. However, The New York Times managed to downplay Cuba’s accusation’s by ending the story by blaming the spread of the disease on returning Cuban troops from Africa and other people from other parts of the Caribbean who might have brought Dengue fever into Cuba:Some State Department officials believe the introduction of dengue-2 into Cuba is a result of the return to Cuba of troops who had been stationed in Angola or elsewhere in Africa, where the strain is found. But Dr. St. John said dengue-2 had been found in other parts of the Caribbean and might have been carried to Cuba from there or elsewhere overseas.Reports suggested that Cuba had a very small number of cases in 1944, and again in 1977. The 1981 outbreak was blamed on covert flyover operations conducted by the CIA with military owned airplanes, you know, the same airplanes that were most probably used against Nicaragua’s Sandinistas to transport weapons and other materials to the Contras around the same time.Since the 20th century, the U.S. has been the leader in developing various biological and chemical weapons through the U.S. Army’s Biological Warfare Laboratories based at Fort Detrick, Maryland since the late 1940′s, around the start of the Cold War.The U.S. biological warfare program that supposedly ended in 1969 developed a handful of biological weapons ready for use including anthrax, Q-fever and botulism and conducted research in hopes of weaponizing diseases including smallpox, Hantavirus, Lassa fever, yellow fever, typhus, dengue fever and the bird flu among them.An article from August 6, 2019 on Fort Detrick from the UK’s ‘The Independent’ titled ‘Research into deadly viruses and biological weapons at US army lab shut down over fears they could escape’ last August. Ironically, Secretary of State and Neocon Mike Pompeo called it the “Wuhan virus” since they blame China for the outbreak, but it seems that the U.S. had its own problems when it comes to their own labs who conduct research with the most deadly viruses:America’s main biological warfare lab has been ordered to stop all research into the deadliest viruses and pathogens over fears contaminated waste could leak out of the facility. Fort Detrick, in Maryland, has been the epicentre of the US Army’s bioweapons research since the beginning of the Cold War. But last month the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) – the government’s public health body – stripped the base of its license to handle highly restricted “select agents”, which includes Ebola, smallpox and anthrax. The story was basically about the CDC who inspected Fort Detrick and found problems with new procedures used to decontaminate waste water. The article says that Fort Detrick continued its research for defensive purposes to “protect the warfighter from biological threats” although the U.S. declared that it abandoned their biological weapons program since 1969:Although the United States officially abandoned its biological weapons programme in 1969, Fort Detrick has continued defensive research into deadly pathogens on the list of “select agents”, including the Ebola virus, the organisms that cause the plague, and the highly toxic poison ricin. The army’s Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, based at Fort Detrick, says its primary mission today is to “protect the warfighter from biological threats” but its scientists also investigate outbreaks of disease among civilians and other threats to public health. In recent years it has been involved in testing possible vaccines for Ebola, after several epidemics of the deadly virus in Africa.Sooner or later, the truth will come out. I believe that the U.S. government knows how COVID-19 began and where it was going. The U.S. government and major corporate arms manufacturers and the rest of the Military-Industrial Complex is no stranger to biological weapons adding to their arsenal of nuclear and chemical weapons at their disposal which makes them, much more dangerous. The truth about COVID-19 will eventually come out. In the meantime, as the COVID-19 pandemic continues, a war against Russia, China, Iran or Venezuela is in the works and a coming economic crisis with an election coming this November seems like 2020 will be the year of a perfect storm.COVID-19 and the CIA’s Biological Warfare on Cuba\n",

      "As the world continues to freak out about COVID-19, the advice from the authorities about what to do seems disproportionate to the the panic they're stoking - wash your hands, don't go out unless you have to, avoid crowds. It seems like a recipe for making people panic.While the MSM have continually poo-pooed any and all alternative therapies in protecting or treating coronavirus infections, they've ignored actual evidence from the very people who have experience with what the rest of the world is currently experiencing; namely Wuhan China. Specifically, doctors who were on the front lines in China during the worst of the epidemic are singing the praises of vitamin C infusions.Today on Objective:Health, we take a look at one of our old favorites for multiple conditions, including coronavirus infections - the mighty vitamin C. Taking vitamin C is actually something everyone could be doing to make a difference in the state of their immune system, well beyond 'wash your hands'.Elliot: Hello everyone, welcome to this week's edition of Objective Health. I am your host Elliot, and joining me in our studio are Doug and Erica. We also have Damian on the ones and twos today.Elliot: Today, we are going to be talking about a very hot topic. We are going to be talking about the Coronavirus. A couple of weeks ago, maybe a couple of months ago now, we did another show on the Coronavirus where we were assessing whether we thought that it was really all that dangerous, whether.there was a little bit of a kicking up of frenzy going on in the media and being a little bit overblown. In today's show we are going to be looking at a potential solution that people can think about and hopefully make use of. We will talk about the clinical utility of using high-dose vitamin C for the Coronavirus. This is because there has been quite a lot of interesting information come out recently.On top of all of the well-established information that we know about vitamin C's potential uses against viruses - and the Coronavirus is a virus - there is good reason to think that if you are to come down with this virus and if you are immunocompromised or if you are a little bit more susceptible to succumbing to any kind of viral infection then using vitamin C in high doses in various different methods of consumption is likely going to be helpful.First of all, I want to talk about one of the recent progressions that has come out of China. Not long ago China announced that they would be thinking about using intravenous vitamin C for their Coronavirus patients. There were three studies done in China I believe, which were looking at the effect of vitamin C on Coronavirus and they have come out with pretty good results. In one of the Chinese medical establishments some of the scientists were advocating for the use of anywhere between 6000mg and 24000mg of vitamin C to be used intravenously. I think this is for the most severe patients who have this viral infection.Doug: The interesting thing about it is the doses they were talking about. 6000-12000mg of vitamin C for IV? That's not even really that high. I know in things like cancer protocols it will get as high as 100g, and even higher sometimes. It's not a low dose by any means but you could take 6000mg orally but the fact that they were getting such good results from those doses says a lot about the power of vitamin C I think.Erica: Most definitely. The mainstream news, at least here in the US, are pooh-poohing these alternative things, \"Don't think that vitamin C is going to cure you.\" It's really concerning because why not take something that is going to keep your immune system strong instead of essentially dumping the baby out with the bathwater and saying \"Nothing is going to work\"? Most people have some sort of vitamin C in their medicine cabinet for these types of things. It's good to have just to keep your immune system strong.Doug: It's not really surprising, but nonetheless shocking, the way the media has been downplaying. From what I have seen and what other people have been reporting, they haven't even mentioned that China was actually using vitamin C as a strategy against the Coronavirus. They basically blanked it like Tulsi Gabbard, they don't even mention the fact, despite the fact that many doctors in China have actually been reporting it and talking about it and explicitly saying that it helps.\n",
      "For the news media here to just turn around and ignore that fact and even go so far as to - not condemn it, that's not the right word - like you said ERica, to pooh-pooh it essentially. \"Oh no, we have to wait for a vaccine, don't bother with any of that woo woo hippy crap.\"Meanwhile, even if people were taking 1000mg of vitamin C 3 or 4 times a day that would at least be helpful. It doesn't necessarily mean that you don't get it or that it's going to cure it instantly, but anything that you can do to help mitigate the effects or prevent it then do it! It's just so stupid for the media to be taking that kind of stance!Elliot: I saw an article earlier today from ABC News I think - one of the alphabet news agencies - the article was titled Coronavirus Cures Debunked. They were talking about vitamin C and they were completely pooh-poohing the idea. It's not even like they are ignoring it, they are actively telling people not to take it! How spineless? These things are well established!One of the top alternative integrated doctors is quoted as saying \"Early in, sufficiently large doses of intravenous vitamin C are critical. Vitamin C is not only a prototypical antioxidant but also involved in virus-killing and prevention of viral replication. The significance of large dose intravenous vitamin C is not just at an antiviral level, it is acute respiratory distress syndrome that kills most people from the Coronavirus. ARDS - Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome is a common final pathway leading to death.\" He is talking about how vitamin C is one of the best ways to protect against that. This is especially going to apply to people who are more susceptible to these kinds of infections so I think it's fair to say that 98% of people who get it are probably not going to have any major issues. The mortality rate is 1-2% and it's people with pre-existing, severe health conditions: immunocompromisation etc. So for these kinds of people it's wise to take the right precautions. Again, when you are listening to the media they are quick to whip up the hysteria but then they don't provide any solutions.Doug: It seems like it is almost the point where there is literally nothing you can do except wash your hands. {laugher} That's the thing that they keep on saying \"wash your hands, wash your hands!\" I was reading somewhere that someone was talking about how disproportionate that is. There is this crazy hysteria that they are pumping out and then the only thing that they are actually offering as something that you can do is wash your hands?It's so disproportionate to the level of threat. It's like the threat is up here and the solution is \"just wash your hands.\" To anything that people actually could do, like take vitamin C, they are saying \"no, no, no, that's not going to work. Just wash your hands\". There was actually an article up on Green Med Info called Tons of Vitamin C to Wuhan - maybe you can pull that one up Damian. If you scroll down a bit there is a tweet there from DSM and I just wanted to show that because they just show a truck delivering 50 tons of vitamin C to Wuhan. What was the date on that one? I guess they've cut off the date so I can't see it. The article was on March 3rd. Clearly, if they are delivering 50 tons that is a hell of a lot of vitamin C so they were using it. It's pretty disingenuous for the western media to completely ignore that fact.If outbreaks in Italy or if anywhere else start to get really bad then they could benefit from this information. The doctors could benefit because they could actually be helping people who aren't at the hospital and who are fighting it at home could benefit from this information. So it makes the blood boil that they would pull this kind of shit, it's terrible.Erica: We had a good article called From Vaccination to Viruses Vitamin C is a Potent Antidote from Orthomolecular Medicine News Service in January and they talk about China. They have a list of addendums regarding practical treatment for the approach to coronavirus in China and there were some things that really stick out, was a strong immune system is really the only significant protection an individual has - again, keeping that vitamin C going, and also they said that a great deal of the immune system's strength, possibly most of it, comes from vitamin C content in the immune cells. \"When the levels of vitamin C in the body are low the immune system can never function at full capacity. There are many measures that can strengthen and support the immune system, but regular supplementation of vitamin C with multi-gram doses - 2000mg daily, or more - is probably the single most important preventative measure. Much larger doses can be given if it is determined the virus has already been contracted.\"They are also talking about nebulising hydrogen peroxide. It destroys all or most of the sorts of viruses in the body with the help of vitamin C, and magnesium can then mop up the rest of the virus. That's pretty helpful if people are freaking out and they don't think that there is anything that they can do. That is something that you can do - keep taking it as a preventative measure more than anything.Doug: The professional doctors are doing the intravenous vitamin C. It should probably be stated that even if you don't have access to intravenous vitamin C, which few people actually do, it's still worthwhile to be taking it orally as well. Take as much as you can until you start to feel digestive symptoms. There are no real side effects from it except some diarrhoea if you take too much of it. Which would you rather deal with? The Coronavirus or a little bit of an upset tummy?I should mention that the website http://orthomolecular.org/ where the article you were talking about came from is actually a really good site. If you go to orthomolecular.org and scroll down to where it says News Releases they have a number of things specifically about the use of vitamin C for Coronavirus and they talk about how it has been used in Wuhan and about the different Chinese doctors who have been reporting on that. Anybody who is interested in more information on this, that is a very good resource.Erica: What about something like liposomal? I know that we have talked on the show before about making your own liposomal vitamin C so that it survives the digestive tract a little bit better. Obviously with intravenous you can get so much more, but with the liposomal it is encapsulated in spheres so that it can survive the digestive tract and get into your body more effectively.Doug: It is just basically increasing the absorption. With any nutrient you take there is a certain percentage that will get absorbed and the rest won't. Taking the liposomal, or liposheric as it is sometimes called, increases that amount that is getting across the digestive tract and into the bloodstream. Yeah, it's effective.\n",
      "Elliot: With making it, you can't really make it very effectively. There are people who claim that you can make it but it doesn't hold up to testing, To make proper liposomal, you need proper liposomal technology so if you really want liposomal vitamin C then you are better off just getting a really high quality one and paying the money for high quality vitamin C.You could probably get similar benefits just by taking a small amount multiple times throughout the day. You wouldn't take a high dose at any one given time because you can only absorb so much at any one given time. If you are taking 1g every hour then you are going to have this continual absorption and you are going to be opening up the transporters to absorb more, if that makes sense?There are lots of options that you can do. If you can't get intravenous, liposomal or oral is going to be the route you have to take. In terms of what vitamin C actually does, there are so many ways to look at this. Vitamin C is well known as an immune booster. Primarily, what it is doing on one level is it is promoting how our immune cells function. So, certain immune cells which are responsible for engulfing pathogens and identifying and clearing out infections quickly become depleted of ascorbic acid. These immune cells which are responsible for surveillance, have a lot of ascorbic acid within them and as they are doing their job they lose that very quickly. By taking ascorbic acid, you are essentially topping up your immune cells. Your immune cells really like ascorbic acid.Then if we look specifically at the Coronavirus, there is a very interesting article written by a lady called Doris Loh. She has done a lot of writing on vitamin C and the various properties of it, specifically in relation to vitamin C and the Coronavirus. She is looking at how the mechanisms by which it actually infects and causes problems for the human body. As a virus, what it is doing is trying to trick our immune system. It has evolved ways to affect our immune system so that it goes undetected and so that we are unable to kill it off.So on the context of how it tricks our immune system, what it's doing is that while we are trying to surveil the environment and pick off these invaders - which takes a lot of energy - the virus disrupts how our immune system is working by affecting how well the cells are able to synthesise energy. There are certain proteins called (N)-proteins of this virus and what they do is block the mitochondria and stop it from synthesising ATP.I had no idea that this was how vitamin C it was working, but the way cells are synthesising energy in the form of ATP is that they are using these things called electron carriers. We have something called NADH and FADH2 and these are being transported into the mitochondria and donating an electron and that is going through another various set of processes so that we can make this usable energy. When this virus infects a cell and disrupts how the mitochondria is functioning we can no longer do this. We can actually become depleted in NADH, or the NADH is unable to effectively donate the electron. What Ascorbic Acid can do is take the place of NADH and can act as an electron donor so that we can synthesise energy. It's almost like ascorbic acid can act as an energy source for our cells - in the context of immune dysfunction.That is not usually a function of ascorbic acid, it's usually used as an antioxidant. When damage occurs in our cells there is what is called oxidation so our cells lose electrons. The function of vitamin C is to donate an electron - it's called reduction - but essentially, it is an antioxidant it's not used in how we are making energy; whereas, what Doris Loh is saying is that in some cases where the mitochondria are so screwed because of a viral infection, vitamin C no longer just becomes an antioxidant. It is actually donating the electron for us to make energy! That is not a well-established fact, but it might be one of the reasons why having such high doses is actually necessary, because it is actually providing a sustained form of energy for the cells when the cells are so infected by some virus that they are unable to make it by other means.Doug: That's interesting!Elliot: This might be one of the ways that vitamin C is actually so beneficial aside from all of its other roles. One of the other ways that the Coronavirus is messing with the immune system is by activating something called a cytokine storm. That's when our innate immune system, the inflammatory process ramps up completely. In someone who is very susceptible, they can't necessarily turn that down. It's not the virus that kills them per se, it's their immune system. It's the inability to shut off their immune system. What vitamin C is potentially doing is allowing us to effectively shut off the immune system when we need to.There are lots of different ways in which vitamin C might be helping, but it is definitely not just as an antioxidant. There are multiple different mechanisms and it is absolutely fascinating. I would recommend listeners to read it, it's called Mitochondria & the Coronavirus, The Vitamin C Connection. All that people really need to know is that Vitamin C can be really useful and we shouldn't downplay the effects of it, it's not just an antioxidant.Doug: Is it also used as a pro-oxidant as well? I had heard that it had pro-oxidant capabilities as well, which is something that the immune system uses to eliminate viruses and bacteria and things like that.Elliot: Exactly, and I think that that is one of the main mechanisms against cancer. I don't know if it is happening against viruses? I'm not familiar with that effect but it would make sense if that is the case. When you take ascorbic acid in low doses it is generally an antioxidant, but when you're giving it in ultra high doses then it actually generates hydrogen peroxide. That is having a pro-oxidant effect, particularly against cancer cells - it is quite selective for cancer cells. I don't know if it would work against viruses or not. I think it works against infections in a similar way. Again, I think that there is lots of stuff that we don't know about it.Erica: Going back to what you were saying about the cytokine storm, stress also has an effect on this. The reaction that everyone is having, the fear, the stress that people are feeling, I'm sure you folks are feeling it in Europe, but also here in the US the stress is just adding to that cytokine storm and the inflammation in the body. It's creating a worse environment for your body by ruminating on it or stressing about it instead of trying to calm that system down.Elliot: It's really unfortunate, because it seems like that is causing a lot more harm. It's inherently destructive. The sheer amount of frenzy and hysteria which is going on seems relatively disproportionate to the actual threat of the Coronavirus. When you compare it to the statistics of other infectious outbreaks it seems relatively minor and it is pretty much a \"nothing-burger\" in my opinion but the media makes it out to be worse.It's the boogeyman at the moment and I think that people are really scared, understandably if they are not well informed, and they are not well informed of how to boost their immune system and all of this other kind of stuff. It's very unfortunate, but ultimately what is really important to know is that cortisol - which is a stress hormone - also modulates the immune system like you were saying Erica. We have multiple branches of the immune system and what the stress hormones are going to be doing is suppressing the branch of the immune system which is responsible for surveilling against infections and against viruses and against parasites.The type of immune cells which are responsible - the ones that I was talking about, the natural killer cells, the lymphocytes, all of these different things which go around the body and are on constant lookout for viruses or bacteria or pathogens - are very sensitive to cortisol. Cortisol will quickly downregulate that system. At the same time it will upregulate the system which is responsible for attacking our own tissues, so we have autoimmune conditions which are massively on the rise. People tend to get sick very frequently as well, so again allowing yourself to get overly stressed is definitely the worst possible thing that you could do if you want to protect yourself against an infection like this. It is very difficult watching the media.Doug: Turn it off!Erica: We were saying before the show that there are those of us who walk outside and things seem normal until you turn on the computer and it's the end of the world which is coming via this Coronavirus. It's the unknowns.Elliot: Is there anything else that anyone would like to say?Doug: One thing that we could say is that there is a popular conception that vitamin C is very high in oranges and orange juice. That is just marketing. You want to get yourself an actual vitamin C supplement. The amounts that you will find in most foods unfortunately is negligible. We are talking about therapeutic doses here so just eating oranges or drinking some orange is really not going to cut it. I just wanted to point that out. You want to be taking at least a gram at a time which is 1000 micrograms.Damian: Milligrams.Doug: Milligrams, thank you Damian. 1000 micrograms is not going to cut it either. Erica: It is probably better and more cost effective to buy ascorbic acid powder as opposed to the chewable ones that the Flintstones make. [Laughter] You know what I mean, the Flintstones vitamins. The powder on it's own is better than having a cocktail that has got lord knows what kind of filers in it. My point is don't buy the Flintstones vitamin C.Elliot: It is much cheaper to get the powder. You can get 100g for about $6. There is no reason not to. What people often notice is that when they are suffering from some kind of an infection then their tolerance goes way up. Usually if someone can only take 4 or 5 grams and any more makes them get digestive symptoms, if they have an infection that can go up by at least 5 times. You can tolerate 5 times what you usually could have tolerated.I know a couple of people who have managed to go up to 30 or 40 grams when they have been poorly, where previously they could only tolerate 3g. It definitely does get used in some way when you are sick. You don't need that much every day but when you are suffering from an infection I find that it tends to help.\n",
      "Erica: Why not be proactive and prevent the stress mechanism from taking over and keep making your little detox cocktail of vitamin C and water. It's not the most enjoyable taste but there are a lot of worse things out there.Doug: True.Elliot: Ok, if that is all for today then I want to thank everyone. Thanks to my co-hosts, thanks to Damian and thanks to the audience, thanks for listening. If you come down with the Coronavirus - I hope you don't but if you do - then you know where to go, get some vitamin C, drink some elderberry tea and rest and don't stress!

      "On 29 January WHO Director-General, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that there was no reason to declare the outbreak of the coronavirus 2019-nCoV in China a pandemic risk. On 30 January, he declared the virus an international emergency, but made clear that there was no reason for countries to issue travel-advisories against travelling to China. Let me speculate – the ‘international emergency’ was declared at the request of Washington, and the comment against the travel-advisory was an addition by Dr. Tedros himself, as he realized that there was indeed no reason for panic, that China is doing wonders in stemming the virus from spreading and in detecting the virus early on.In fact, Dr. Tedros has himself, as well as other high-ranking WHO officials, on various occasions praised China for her effort to contain the virus, the speed with which Wuhan (population of 11 million, capital of the center-eastern Province of Hubei) and China as a whole has reacted to the outbreak. The latest achievement – in 8 days China has built in Wuhan a 25000 m2 special hospital for treatment of the coronavirus 2019-nCoV and possible mutations, with 1000 beds, and for about 1400 medical personnel, for a budget of the equivalent of US$ 43 million – equipped with state-of-the-art medical technology. No other country in the world would have been capable of such an achievement.Nevertheless, and against WHO’s guidance, Washington immediately advised its citizens not to travel to China, and withdrew non-essential staff from US consulates and the Embassy in Beijing, thereby triggering an avalanche of similar reactions among Washington vassals around the globe – i.e. most of the European countries did likewise, many of them canceled their flights to China, as did of course the US. For some reasons I have yet to understand, Russia closed her 4200 km long border with China. Would Russia fall to the western panic-mongering propaganda hype? – Hard to believe. But then what is the reason?The NYT and WashPo are on a vicious daily campaign to slander and vilify China with lies and manipulated information on how badly China is managing the disease, when the complete opposite is the case. Compare this to the common flu epidemic, that hits the US and most of the western countries, despite the fact that the US and Europe have virtually implemented carpet vaccination (in some US States and EU countries even compulsory).Yet, this 2019 / 2020 flu season which is far from over, has so far claimed more than 8400 lives alone in the US, more than 140000 hospitalizations and more than 8 million infected people. The US has about 330 million people. Compare this to China’s 1.4 billion population – with, as of 3 February, an infection rate of less than 21000, a death toll of 425 in China, and outside of China reported two, one in Hong Kong, another one in the Philippines.Expand these statistics to Europe and you find similar figures. Of course, nobody talks about it. This is an annual occurrence – a bonanza for the western pharma industry. In the west, disease is business. The more the merrier. Once you are in the “medical mill”, it’s difficult to escape. “Specialists’ find always another reason to send you yet to another “specialist” – for another treatment. The ignorant patient has no option than to obey – after all its his health and life. In China it is the total opposite. The Chinese system does everything for its population’s health and well-being.Yet, China bashing in one way or another seems to intensify by the day. Yesterday, 3 February, the UN in Geneva has issued an edict that all UN employees returning from China must stay home and work from home for 14 days, i.e. a dictated self-quarantine. And new contracts for Chinese staff will be temporarily suspended. This is all propaganda against China.Quarantine is absolutely not necessary. Chinese biologists of the Office of Science and Technology of the city of Wuxi (south-eastern Jiangsu province, near Shanghai) have developed a test kit that can detect the 2019-nCoV virus within 8 – 15 minutes, similar to a pregnancy test. This test kit is available to the world. In fact, it has been used to test an airline crew member arriving from New York at the Zurich airport and feeling ill. Within less than an hour, the crew member was sent home – it was the common flu.In China, where by now scientific evidence is mounting that the disease – like all the coronaviral diseases, including the 2019-nCoV predecessor SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, 2002 / 2003 also in China), and its Middle East equivalent, MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) are not only laboratory fabricated, but also patented. And so are many others, for example, Ebola and HIV. Both, SARS and 2019-nCoV are not only man-made, but they are also focusing on the Chinese race. That’s why you find very few people infected in the 18 countries where the coronavirus has spread.It sounds like a strange coincidence that in October 2019 a simulation with precisely the coronavirus was carried out at the John Hopkins Institute in the US, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the WEF (World Economic Forum), as well as the Pirbright Institute of the UK, one of the world’s few level 4 (highest security level) bio-warfare laboratories.The west’s ‘demolition’ priority seems to have shifted drastically from Russia to China. Why? – Because China is an ever-stronger economic power, soon to surpass the United States in absolute terms. Since mid-2017, China is already number one, measured by the PPP (Purchasing Power Parity) indicator, indeed the most important one, because it demonstrates what people can actually buy with the money.China’s currency, the Yuan, is also advancing rapidly as a reserve currency, gradually replacing the US-dollar. When that happens, that real money, like the Chinese Yuan, based on a hard economy and covered by gold, against a “fake” fiat currency (based on nothing), like the US-dollar, is taking the lead, then the US-dollar hegemony is broken and the US economy doomed.To prevent that from happening Washington is doing everything possible to destabilize China – see Hong Kong, Taiwan, the Uyghurs in China’s western Xinjiang Province, Tibet, the infamous Trump-inspired “tariff war” – and now the new coronavirus outbreak. The death toll is at present about 2.1% (of total cases of infection), down from 2.3% a week ago.But that and the constant bashing with negative western propaganda, travel bans, border closures, flight bans – and more – plus the disease itself, the medical care, work absenteeism, medication and medical equipment, not to forget the specially-built 1000-bed emergency hospital in Wuhan – and an 8% average decline at the Shanghai stock exchange, bear a considerable economic cost for China. So much so, that the People’s Bank of China (PBC) has recently injected some 1.2 billion yuan (about US$ 174 million equivalent) into the economy.This new coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, may just be a trial. Imagine a stronger mutation of a coronavirus would be implanted into the Chinese population, say with a mortality rate of 10% to 20% or higher – it could cause real havoc. However, a stronger version may not be so easily controllable and directable – i.e. towards the Chinese race – and may risk spreading to the Caucasian race as well – meaning the executioner would risk committing mass suicide.Remember the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918, the deadliest in history, infected an estimated 500 million people worldwide – at that time about one-third of the planet’s population – and killed at least 50 million people (a death rate of 10%), including some 700000 Americans.While preparing for the worst, because Washington – with the help of its level 4 bio-war lab –  will not let go easily, China’s approach of endless inventive creation, avoiding conflicts, will outlive the aggressor.China – Western China Bashing – vs. Western Bio-warfare?\n",

      "senior fellow at Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies, Renmin University of China, and former director of economic and business policy for the mayor of London. He lived in Moscow from 1992-2000.China’s outperformance of the US in both the 2008 crisis & the Covid-19 outbreak will see a geopolitical shift in Beijing’s favor. The longer the US continues with its disastrous pandemic response, the greater the shift will be.The pandemic has a clear global course. Despite the coronavirus outbreak beginning in China, Beijing has brought it rapidly under control – the number of domestically transmitted cases was reduced to virtually zero by the end of March. In the US and Western Europe, on the contrary, the number of cases is rising vertiginously with no peak in sight.In absolute terms, the number of US and Italian coronavirus cases is already greater than China’s. But comparisons in absolute numbers greatly understate the severity of the coronavirus crisis in the US and Western Europe – due to their populations being far smaller than China. In reality, the relative severity of the US and Western European coronavirus pandemic is already far worse than at the worst point of the crisis in China and is still rising. This disastrous US and Western European failure will be more severe than the international financial crisis and will have profound geopolitical consequences.What does China’s success mean?\n",
      "Two key issues immediately follow from China’s success – how did China achieve this, and what is its international impact?Technically, China’s means of controlling the coronavirus were not unknown – quarantines, deliveries of essentials to homes to allow the population to stay indoors, compulsory mask wearing, testing, transfer of medical personnel to affected areas. China certainly implemented these far more rigorously than the US and Western Europe. But behind that technical difference was a clear understanding of society by China.The most fundamental issue was that China started from a real understanding of human rights as they affect the real lives of people – not the artificial constructs of Western, purely formal ‘human rights.’ In a lethal epidemic, the key human right is to stay alive. More generally, for real human beings, the most fundamental issue in your life is not whether you can use Facebook, or cast a vote for a politician who promises one thing at an election and then does something completely different after it in a system which gives no real control over them, but the real ability to stay alive when faced with a deadly threat, and to have a decent and rising standard of living, to have health care, to have education, and innumerable other real concerns of people.Within that context, the struggle against the coronavirus was on such a scale that it had to be carried out as a war – in China, it is frequently referred to as a ‘People’s War’ against the virus.This explains China’s measures. Its strategy was strictly logical once this starting point was understood. Above all, it was necessary to do everything possible to confine the virus to Wuhan and Hubei – if it had spread throughout China it would have been impossible to control. Therefore, the first decisive measure was strict travel restrictions.If people had been allowed to leave Wuhan/Hubei, overwhelming numbers would have fled with the virus spreading uncontrollably throughout China – this is precisely what is occurring in the US or Spain where people fleeing infection centers such as New York or Madrid are spreading the virus.There is no doubt this caused tremendous suffering in Wuhan/Hubei. By preventing people from leaving, this placed inconceivable pressure on Hubei’s health system. China poured tens of thousands of medical staff into Hubei but this necessarily took time.It may be compared to one of the greatest battles in Soviet history – Stalingrad. There, it was vitally necessary for the defenders within Stalingrad to tie the German Army down in combat within the city itself while the Soviet Army prepared the encirclement which finally smashed the Nazis to pieces. The result was that Soviet casualties within Stalingrad itself were terrible – the city’s defenders gave their lives to ensure the Soviet people’s decisive victory. In a parallel manner, people in Wuhan gave their lives to protect the people of the whole of China. Hubei and Wuhan’s medical staff are rightly regarded as heroes of the Chinese people.\n",
      "Once the decisive task of preventing the virus’ spread had been achieved, then China could put pressure on the virus in Hubei and finally Wuhan. I have good friends in Wuhan. I know the people understood this national strategy despite the intense suffering it meant in Wuhan.Catastrophic failure of ‘human rights’ in the West. But what was the response of the so called ‘human rights’ organizations in the West to this? Total and criminal condemnation of China’s successful strategy!Kenneth Roth, executive director of ‘Human Rights Watch,’ declared: “In typical Chinese Communist Party fashion, Beijing confines 35 million people rather than pursuing the transparent and targeted approach to the Wuhan coronavirus that public health and human rights require.” The Guardian in Britain published article after article attacking China’s methods of dealing with the virus before finally admitting on March 20, almost two months after China started its decisive actions: “Rigid travel restrictions and social distancing requirements appear to have had their desired effect.”Joshua Wong, a supporter of the Hong Kong rioters, called for the WHO director general’s resignation because the organization supported China’s successful strategy.By the end of March, most of the world recognized that China had been correct. For example, a recent column on Bloomberg in the US had the self-evident headline: “The rest of the world is falling in step with Beijing’s way of fighting the coronavirus.”  “Had China not imposed such steps, one simulation suggests there could have been eight million cases by February… In fact, each government seems to be reinventing the wheel, though events eventually force them to take China’s path: closing schools and public places, shutting borders, imposing curfews, inhibiting movement,” the column read.If the advice of Roth, the Guardian, or Wong had been taken, by now thousands more people, more probably tens of thousands, would be dead.Failure in US. This wrong approach in the West has now created a disaster in the US and Western Europe. The catastrophic scale of this is simply disguised by making comparisons in terms of absolute numbers between China and individual Western countries. This conceals the fact that the impact of the coronavirus epidemic in Western countries is many times greater than during the worst period in China – because China’s population is far larger than any Western country – more than four times that of the US and 23 times Italy’s.So, for example, WHO data for March 28 shows the US had 16894 new daily coronavirus cases – 4.3 times as high as China’s worst daily peak of 3887. But China’s population is 4.25 times that of the US. So, in proportion to China’s population, the US figures are equal to 71799 (16894 x 4.25). The relative intensity of the impact of the coronavirus in the US is therefore already more than 18 times as great as the worst day in China! And the number of daily cases in the US is on a strongly rising upward curve. A literal catastrophe is unfolding in the US. To understand the impact of this, US troops abroad have many times suffered severe war casualties – World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Iraq. But only twice in American history have there been mass death events on US soil itself – the Civil War and 1918-19’s Spanish flu epidemic. Unless there is a dramatic, and unlikely, change in US policy within days, there will be the third mass death event in the US. This will necessarily hammer the US economy with a downturn worse than the international financial crisis.Geopolitical consequences. The geopolitical consequences of this situation are both immediate and long term. In the short term, so far, the coronavirus has only hit three regions with mass force – China, the US, and Western Europe. Countries in other regions will feel its full force in the coming weeks. They can either attempt to follow the successful path of China or they can follow the disastrous one of the US.Furthermore China, the world’s greatest manufacturer, can be of decisive practical aid to them. Such a simple fact as that France can order one billion facemasks from China shows what is possible. The nonsense of the formal Western concept of human rights will be demonstrated to billions of people. This will inevitably produce a geopolitical shift in China’s favor.How deep the longer-term geopolitical consequences will be depends on how long the US continues on its present catastrophic course. It is now impossible for the US to avoid a severe recession – certainly the sharpest decline in output since the Great Depression and possibly worse. How quickly the US economy can recover depends on how rapidly it can solve its medical crisis. But to achieve this means, for the reasons already given, the US abandoning its totally false concept of human rights, its subordination of human lives to the economy and, in essence, admitting that China was correct. Such a tremendous shift is unlikely to come nearly fast enough in a pandemic in which literally every day counts.In the last 12 years, the world has passed through two huge global tests – the international financial crisis and the coronavirus pandemic. In both, China has far outperformed the US. This will necessarily lead to a major shift in geopolitics in favor of China. The longer the US continues with its present disastrous response to the coronavirus, the greater that shift will be.Human life must trump economics in a pandemic.

      "The novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) that is threatening modern civilization today is a disaster that was bound to happen mainly because of human folly. This is an inevitable consequence of the dominance of a neoliberal, national security state doctrine with a military-industrial complex pushing for perpetual war and corporate globalization.This has devastated entire ecosystems, distorted medical science and disempowered communities.This power elite doctrine is the root cause of the increasingly serious cases of emerging infectious diseases over the past 40 years or so—coinciding with the destruction of our ecosphere, gross disrespect of the intimate relationship between humans and the environment, and the reductionist thinking about infectious diseases and health.Despite the fact that scientific evidence clearly shows that viruses and other microbes are largely friends and have been playing a significant role in the evolution and survival of all life forms in our entire ecosystem, the power elite institutions and their agents have declared these microbes as mortal enemies that deserve to be eliminated. Microbes and their elements are in fact essential components of the human biological entity and perform critical physiologic functions that maintain homeostasis and a robust immune system. Rather than cultivating harmony and co-existence, most humans have declared total war against them.This belligerent attitude is also a result of a largely mistaken understanding of infectious disease and illness propagated by a reductionist medical paradigm which fails to recognize that illness is in fact a disruption of the harmony between humans and their physical, chemical, biological, spiritual and social environment.\n",
      "Thus, the distorted, corporate-controlled medical science have pushed for mass vaccinations with the aim of total elimination despite scientific evidence that mass vaccinations do more harm than good.Furthermore, the military-industrial complex have been, for several decades, converting and harnessing microbes as “weapons of mass destruction” of people perceived to be their enemies.It is logical to consider that a secret bioweapons program is a major proximal causative driving factor that created this coronavirus pandemic. There were in fact numerous clear warning signals that this was bound to happen but these were ignored and nonchalantly dismissed.As early as 1970, a World Health Organization (WHO) group of consultants in their comprehensive report on chemical and biological weapons noted that “a virulent mutant (microbe)… could spread rapidly to produce an uncontrollable epidemic on a large scale.” In addition, they warned that there was the “ever-present risk of an accidental escape.” Indeed this prediction was prescient. A list of biolab accidents compiled by the Stop the Biolab Movement in Boston, USA showed more than 50 biolab accidents from 1985-2007, occurring mostly in the US, including 7 accidents involving the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID).Despite the clear dangers to public health, the US Federal government has dramatically increased US research and development activity and infrastructure focused on biological weapons agents.More than two dozen large new high-containment research facilities were funded specifically to work with bioweapons agents, according to the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation.“When more dangerous research is performed by more people in more locations, there are simply more opportunities for significant biosafety or biosecurity breaches to occur… Worse, if the accident involves an agent such as the 1918 influenza virus, which was reconstructed at the US Center for Disease Control (CDC) in 2005, it could start a global pandemic,” it added.USAMRIID itself recorded a total of 128 incidents occurring from 2016 to 2018, with seven incidents of potential biological exposures. Some risk of exposure to infectious agents and/or toxins may have occurred, and has resulted in precautionary medical surveillance of the personnel involved.On July 2019, the CDC issued a cease and desist order to USAMRIID after problems were found in its biosafety level 3 and 4 laboratories. 12 The USAMRIID located at Fort Detrick, Georgia is known to be the highly secretive epicenter of US bioweapons research, with a history of illicit human experiments and research on the production of genetically-modified organisms for deployment as weapons of war.US military secret biolabs have in fact been most advanced in doing research on pathogenic microorganisms including SARS and other coronaviruses. In 2018, the Pentagon’s Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) began spending millions on such research.Some of those Pentagon-funded studies were conducted at known US military bioweapons laboratories bordering China, and has resulted in the discovery of dozens of new coronavirus strains as recently as last April 2019.At the same time, DARPA also embarked on a secretive research to disperse infectious genetically modified viruses that have been engineered to edit crop chromosomes directly in fields. Ostensibly, the research program aims to allow farmers to adapt to changing climate conditions.\n",
      "However, independent scientists warned that DARPA’s program could create uncontrollable and potentially dangerous genetically engineered viruses—using insects as the vehicle for a Horizontal Environmental Genetic Alteration Agents (HEGAAS), or, in other words, using insects to disperse them—in a ‘new class’ of biological warfare.Genetic engineering technology facilitates horizontal transfer and unnatural recombination of genetic material across species barriers–precisely the conditions favoring the creation of new viruses and bacteria that cause diseases.Many scientists have warned that increased commercial exploitation of genetic engineering in both agriculture and medicine have actually unleashed the potential for creating viruses and bacteria more virulent than nature’s worst.Despite ostensibly justifiable objectives and avowed compliance to biosafety protocols, unexpected results do happen with potentially disastrous consequences.\n",
      "This was aptly demonstrated in 2001 when Australian scientists trying to make a mouse contraceptive vaccine for pest control instead accidentally created a virus that kills every one of its victims, by wiping out part of their immune system.Scientists funded by the US government, however, did a similar thing intentionally in 2003, supposedly to study how to counter a killer virus.Dr. Mark Buller, a virologist at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and working for the US Biodefense Program under the USAMRIID at Fort Detrick, has created, through genetic engineering technology, a mousepox strain that kills 100 per cent of vaccinated mice, even when they were also treated with the antiviral drugs.Notably, in 2015, Dr. Ralph Baric and his team at the University of North Carolina, who also created a virus using genetic engineering, with the surface protein of the SHC014 coronavirus found in horseshoe bats in China, and the backbone of one that causes human-like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in mice.\n",
      "The study demonstrated the ability of the SHC014 surface protein, in a genetically engineered coronavirus, to bind and infect human cells, validating concerns that this virus—or other coronaviruses found in bat species—may be capable of making the leap to people without first evolving in an intermediate host.Interestingly, scientists from the Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology in China were collaborators in the study.\n",
      "In the following year, Dr. Baric and his team (this time without the scientists from Wuhan, China), published another study entitled “SARS-like WIV1-CoV poised for human emergence.” The results “indicate a significant threat posed by WIV1-CoV.Both full-length and chimeric WIV1-CoV readily replicated efficiently in human airway cultures and in vivo, suggesting capability of direct transmission to humans. In addition, while monoclonal antibody treatments prove effective, the SARS-based vaccine approach failed to confer protection.Together, the study indicates an ongoing threat posed by WIV1-related viruses and the need for continued study and surveillance.” 29 It should be noted that as early as 2012,Dr. Baric had received a $2.4 M grant from the NIAID “to identify key immune regulatory genes and networks that control disease severity, better understand how immune compartments ‘talk’ to one another and determine disease outcomes after infection.Several US agencies–particularly, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and its subsidiary, the NIAID, and USAMRIID have been collaborating on research projects, ostensibly to develop strategies to fight rapidly evolving pathogens that pose a threat to public health.\n",
      "However, other scientists have expressed their worry that human error could lead to the accidental release of a virus that has been enhanced in the lab so that it is more deadly or more contagious than it already is.In fact, in 2015, the US government banned such “gain of function” research involving the flu virus, viruses causing Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and SARS, following a research study that genetically modified the H5N1 influenza virus so that it could spread between ferrets (a model for studying flu in people), raising fears that the virus could jump to humans, and after US government laboratories working with pathogens had several accidents. The ban was lifted in 2019.Given the foregoing context, it is not surprising that a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV2 (which causes the disease COVID-19), has emerged and is now causing a serious pandemic wreaking havoc all over the world.The official narrative of the US Center for Disease Control, WHO, most governments and the mainstream media is that SARS-CoV2 has its origin in bats and is linked to a large seafood and live animal market in Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the pandemic and where it was reportedly first discovered.Even the Chinese Center for Disease Control initially announced that SARS-CoV2 started at the seafood market in Wuhan.Later, though, a spokesman for China’s ministry of foreign affairs claimed that COVID-19 may have been brought into China by US soldiers who were in Wuhan 14 days before the first case of SARS-CoV2 infection was discovered, and that the origin might be the United States.He cited reports that Japanese and Taiwanese epidemiologists and pharmacologists have determined that the new coronavirus could have originated in the US, since that country is the only one known to have all five types – from which all others must have descended.Wuhan in China has only one of those types, rendering it in analogy as a kind of “branch” which cannot exist by itself but must have grown from a “tree.”Part of the proof of this assertion is that the genome varieties of the virus in Iran and Italy have been sequenced and declared to have no part of the variety that infected China and must, by definition, have originated elsewhere.It would seem the only possibility for origination would be the US because only that country has the “tree trunk” of all the varieties.It may therefore be true that the original source of the COVID-19 virus was the US military biowarfare lab at Fort Detrick. This would not be a surprise, given that the CDC completely shut down Fort Detrick.This assertion seems to have been corroborated by the testimony of the CDC director in Congress, admitting that some deaths in the US, which later proved to be positive for SARS-CoV2 virus, have been miscategorised as the flu.40. According to a Taiwanese virologist, the virus outbreak may have began earlier than assumed, saying, “We must look to September of 2019,” or months before SARS-CoV2 was discovered.The assertion that the SARS-CoV2 may have originated from a lab is being disputed by the director of the NIH and some scientists working for the NIAID, who claim that SARS-CoV2 emerged naturally from animals .In a statement published in The Lancet, a group of scientists said, “We…strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin. Scientists from multiple countries have published and analysed genomes of the causative agent, SARS-CoV-2, and they overwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife.” However, one could easily discover that the studies from which their conclusion was based can be traced back to studies done under the US biodefense program, largely through the aforementioned NIAID.The Chinese study done at the Wuhan Institute of Virology cited by the group to support their claims was led by Zheng-Li Shi who actually collaborated earlier in 2015 with Dr. Baric at the University of North Carolina in creating, using genetic-engineering technology, an extremely lethal SARS-like coronavirus that demonstrated the ability to infect human cells. As what happens in many controversial issues, scientists from different camps often have conflicting viewpoints on the same observable phenomenon.One must dig deeper into the controversy, taking into account other relevant information, including the integrity and credibility of sources of information and potential technical and other biases, in order to come up with a rational judgment of what might be closer to the truth.The emergence of SARS-CoV2 virus must also be viewed in a broad context, taking into account not only the technical-scientific view but more importantly, the ecological, historical, and socio-geopolitical factors involved.At this point, the preponderance of evidence seems to favor the assertion that SARS-CoV2 emerged from biowarfare research activities, most likely a result of genetic engineering manipulation.There is a very complex set of influences that drives the infinitesimal probabilities of outcomes from mutations, recombinations, and other genetic and epigenetic dynamic phenomena that are unavoidably and unpredictably generated during viral replication. How SARS-CoV2 emerged can be looked at from various perspectives.From a limited biological perspective, it seems reasonable to infer from genome analysis that it may have emerged due to natural processes. Natural processes, however, are usually evolutionary and does not occur in a very short period of time.The observed characteristics of SARS-CoV2 at the genomic and clinical expression levels are not in accordance with the norms of nature. It is more in accordance with reality to expect that intervening factors have operated at different levels that trumped the expected genomic evolutionary pathway.There are ecological, geographical, social, technological (ex. genetic engineering), individual human behaviour (ex. unscrupulous scientists and the power elite) and other factors that come into play.It is quite obvious that human interference have changed natural ecosystems, have created artificial genomic element and microorganisms, and have facilitated unnatural recombinations and mutations.From this wholistic perspective, one can conclude that it is highly unlikely that SARS-CoV2 emerged naturally as a result of simply increased human-animal interaction.While it appears from genomic analysis of the SARS-CoV2 virus points to an evolutionary origin from bat coronaviruses, the preponderance of evidence from a broad context points to anthropogenic origin (a result of human activity) with the use of genetic engineering technology as the most likely proximal cause, not necessarily precluding prior origin from bats or other animals.Whether the virus emerged due to accidental release from ostensibly well-meaning but dangerous researches on highly pathogenic organisms or due to a secret biowarfare act is not clear.From the available information so far, it is more likely that there was probably an accidental release of the virus from a laboratory engaged in “biodefense” (biowarfare) research. It is also not clear where exactly this laboratory might be.The experience with “emerging” infectious diseases like SARS, MERS, Ebola and others should have given humanity sufficient lessons to adequately prevent and manage COVID-19.Perhaps official explanations of the origin of these emerging infectious diseases and existing medical guidelines and modalities on how to manage them are fundamentally flawed.If the existing paradigm is mistaken, then the current practices in the management of the pandemic are also flawed and perhaps more importantly, preventive measures to forestall future pandemics will also be flawed.All theories, including the so-called “conspiracy theories,” that might offer rational explanations must be examined and investigated seriously without pre-judgement.The precautionary principle should be the norm in the assessment of risks. A truly independent international investigative group should be organized to do this.Origin of COVID-19: Ecological, Historical, and Geopolitical\n",

      "The 2019-nCov (coronavirus) epidemic originated in Wuhan, China and is now spreading to many other continents and countries, causing a public fear. Worst of all, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral drugs for 2019-nCov available. This adds to the public fear and gloomy outlook. A quick, rapidly deployable and accessible, effective and also safe treatment is urgently needed to not only save those patients, to curtail the spread of the epidemic, but also very important in the psychological assurance to people worldwide, and to the Chinese in particular. Acute organ failure, especially pulmonary failure (acute respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS) is the key mechanism for 2019-nCov's fatality. Significantly increased oxidative stress due to the rapid release of free radicals and cytokines etc. is the hallmark of ARDS which leads to cellular injury, organ failure and death. Early use of large dose antioxidants, especially vitamin C (VC), therefore, plays a key role in the management of these patients. We call upon all those in the leadership, and those providing direct assistance patients, to bravely and rapidly apply large dose intravenous vitamin C (IVC) to help those patients and to stop this epidemic.2019-nCov is a rapidly developing epidemic with a high morbidity and mortality.Wang et al reports 26% ICU admission rate and a 4.3% mortality rate in their 138 confirmed cases. Chen et all report that out of 99 confirmed 2019-nCov patients, 17 (17%) patients developed ARDS and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure.Increased oxidative stress, an underlying \"cytokine storm,\" leads to ARDS which is the key pathology of high mortality of these pandemic viral infections. Cytokine storm-induced ARDS is the key pathology leading to death of these patients. Intravenous vitamin C effectively counters oxidative stress.Cytokine storm\n",
      "Coronaviruses and influenza are among the pandemic viruses that can cause lethal lung injuries and death from ARDS. Viral infections cause a \"cytokine storm\" that can activate lung capillary endothelial cells leading to neutrophil infiltration and increased oxidative stress (reactive oxygen and nitrogen species) that further damages lung barrier function. ARDS, which is characterized by severe hypoxemia, is usually accompanied by uncontrolled inflammation, oxidative injury, and the damage to the alveolar-capillary barrier. The increased oxidative stress is a major insult in pulmonary injury such as acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), two clinical manifestations of acute respiratory failure with substantially high morbidity and mortality.\n",
      "In a report of 29 patients confirmed of 2019-nCov pneumonia patients, 27 (93%) showed increased hsCRP, a marker of inflammation (and oxidative stress). Transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a major regulator of antioxidant response element- (ARE-) driven cytoprotective protein expression. The activation of Nrf2 signaling plays an essential role in preventing cells and tissues from injury induced by oxidative stress. Vitamin C is an essential element of the antioxidant system in cellular response.Part of vitamin C's biological effects in critical care management are well reviewed in a recent article by Nabzdyk and Bittner from Mass Gen Hospital of Harvard Medical School on World's Journal of Critical Care Medicine:Antioxidants, especially large dose IV vitamin C (IVC) in the management of ARDS.\n",
      "It's clear that increased oxidative stress plays a major role in the pathogenesis of ARDS and death. Cytokine storm is observed in both viral and bacterial infections Cytokine storm leads to increased oxidative stress, ARDS and death seems to be a common and non-specific pathway. This is important in clinical management. Since the prevention and management targeting increased oxidative stress with large dose of antioxidants seems a logical step and can be applied to these deadly pandemics, without the lengthy waiting for pathogen-specific vaccines and drugs, as is the case of the current 2019-nCov epidemic.As a matter of fact, large dose intravenous vitamin C (IVC) has been used clinically successfully in viral ARDS and also in influenza. Fowler et al described a 26-year-old woman developed viral ARDS (rhinovirus and enterovirus-D68). She was admitted to ICU. After failure to routine standard management, she was placed on ECMO on day 3. High dose IVC (200mg/kg body/24 hour, divided in 4 doses, one every 6 hours) was also started on ECMO day 1. Her lungs showed significant improvement on day 2 of high dose IVC infusion on X-ray imaging. She continued to improve on ECMO and IVC and ECMO was discontinued on ECMO day 7 and the patient recovered and was discharged from the hospital on hospital day 12, without the need of supplemental oxygen. One month later, X-ray of her lungs showed complete recovery. Gonzalez et al (including one of the authors, Thomas Levy) reported recently a severe case of influenza successfully treated with high dose IVC. 25-year-old MG developed flu-like symptoms which was rapidly deteriorating to the degree that, about 2 weeks later, the patient barely had the energy to use the toilet. He was placed on high dose IVC (50000 mg of vitamin C in 1000 ml Ringer's solution, infused over 90 minutes). The patient immediately reported significant improvement the next day. On day 4 of IVC infusion he reported to feel normal. He continued oral VC (2000 mg twice daily). Another story has been widely circulating on the social media that large dose IVC reportedly was used in 2009 to save a New Zealand farmer, Alan Smith (Primal Panacea). One of us (Thomas Levy) was consulted upon in this case [11] [12]. Hemila et al reported that vitamin C shortens ICU stay in their 2019 meta-analysis of 18 clinical studies with a total of 2004 ICU patients on the journal Nutrients. In this report, 17000 mg/day IVC shortened the ICU stay by 44%. Marik et al reported their use of IVC in 47 sepsis ICU cases. They found a significant reduction in mortality rate in the IVC group of patients.Dietary antioxidants (vitamin C and sulforaphane) were shown to reduce oxidative-stress-induced acute inflammatory lung injury in patients receiving mechanical ventilation. Other antioxidants (curcumin) have also been shown to have promising anti-inflammatory potential in pneumonia.High dose IVC has been clinically used for several decades and a recent NIH expert panel document states clearly that high dose IVC (1.5 g/kd body weight) is safe and without major side effects.Summary.2019-nCov pneumonia is a rapidly developing disease with high morbidity and mortality rate. The key pathogenesis is the acute lung injury causing ARDS and death. Coronaviruses, influenza viruses and many other pandemic viral infections are usually associated with an increase oxidative stress leasing to oxidative cellular damage resulting in multi-organ failure. Antioxidants administration therefore has a central role in the management of these conditions, in addition to the standard conventional supportive therapies. Preliminary clinical studies and case reports show that early administration of high dose IVC can improve clinical conditions of patients in ICU, ARDS and flu. It needs to be pointed that pandemics like 2019-nCov will happen in the future. Specific vaccines and antiviral drugs R&D take long time to develop and are not available for the current nCov epidemic and won't be ready when the next pandemic strikes. IVC and other antioxidants are universal agents for ARDS that can be rapidly applied clinically. Given that high dose IVC is safe, can be effective, we call on the involved leadership and healthcare professionals to look into high dose IVC without further delay. More clinical studies of the IVC and oral VC (such as liposomal-encapsulated VC) are needed to develop standard protocols for the current use and future uses are urgently needed. We hope when the next pandemic strikes, we won't be so helpless and we'll be ready.Early Large Dose Intravenous Vitamin C is the Treatment of Choice for 2019-nCov Pneumonia\n",

      "What will be next? Is a question on many people’s minds. Very likely the world will never be the same again. That might be god, or not so good, depending on how we look at this disastrous, “pandemic” which by all serious accounts does not deserve the term pandemic, that was unwittingly given to the MERS-2-CoV, or 2019-nCoV, renamed by WHO to COVID-19. In mid-February Dr. Tedros, WHO’s Director General called it a pandemic. This decision was already taken by the WEF (World Economic Forum) in Davos, from20 -24 January 2020, when the total COVID19 cases outside of China were recorded by WHO as 150. This was a first indication that there was something not quite right, that there is another agenda behind the “outbreak” of the COVID19 disease.On February 28, in a peer-reviewed article in the highly reputed New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of NIAID (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, one of the 27 institutes and centers that make up the US National Institutes of Health – NIH), likened COVID19 to a stronger than usual common flu:If one assumes that the number of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic cases is several times as high as the number of reported cases, the case fatality rate may be considerably less than 1%. This suggests that the overall clinical consequences of Covid-19 may ultimately be more akin to those of a severe seasonal influenza (which has a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1%) or a pandemic influenza (similar to those in 1957 and 1968) rather than a disease similar to SARS or MERS, which have had case fatality rates of 9 to 10% and 36%, respectively.In the meantime, other high-ranking scientist, microbiologists and medical doctors from all over the world, are questioning the draconian worldwide shutdown because of the corona virus. They all say, these measures are not necessary to contain a pandemic of this relatively low magnitude, i.e. a fatality rate of about 0.1%. Even in Italy, if the counting and accounting was done more carefully, more according to true statistical norms, the fatality rate would be perhaps 1%, or less. What the world is experiencing, resembles a well-planned worldwide declaration and implementation of Martial Law with socioeconomically disastrous consequences, far worse than the disease itself. Nobody moves. The economy comes to an almost standstill.This begs the question, what is behind it, and what comes next? Let’s first look at a not-so-good scenario. In the US job losses are currently reported at more than 10 million. Unemployment expected to rise to at least 35% within the next few weeks; bankruptcies will be spiraling out of control within a month or two – with a further domino effect on unemployment.We may be looking at a complete collapse of our western economy, and growing misery- for the masses. – What will happen to these people, without jobs, without incomes, many of them may also lose their homes, as they will not be able to pay their mortgages or rents? – They may die from famine, diseases of all sorts, despair – the desired world population reduction that Bill Gates, Rockefeller and Co aspire. It may be part of and the beginning of their sinister eugenics plan.\n",
      "The doomsday picture may continue as all the bankrupt small and medium size enterprises – including airlines, tourist industries – et al, will be bought up by huge monopolies, that already exist, Google, Amazon, AliBaba and more. Mergers of gigantic proportions may take place. It may be the last shift of capital from the bottom to the top in our era of civilization as we know it.A global vaccination program with toxins and DNA-altering proteins contained in the injected immune-serum may be forced upon the surviving population. Included within the injection of vaccine may be a nano-chip, that people are not aware of, but that may be uploaded with all your personal data, from health records, to traffic violations, to your bank account – so that you can be followed, surveyed and watched over – every step you take. And every dissenting view you voice will be recorded and listened to, and you may be punished by your money being confiscated or a drone may do away with you, depending on the gravity of the dissent. Yes, the implantation of a nano-chip is a reality.An electronic digital one-world-currency system is planned and may be imposed – and your money, spending and savings may be controlled through the microchip in your body.The poison in the forced-vaccines may also do their work. They may make you sterile, sick – and, eventually die. Especially, the elderly with a reduced immune system. They must go first. That’s part of the eugenics plan – that Rockefeller dreams of and his crony, Bill Gates, may implement with his insane and phanatic vaccination programs.  The elderly use up much too much of the social capital, health care, pensions, living space.Those who survive, may pass on the deadly genome defects caused by the vaccines to their children – and they may eventually die or be deformed, or live with neurological damage- and pass the calamity on to the next generation – and the next.Some of them, will selectively be cured. Induced mutations for cure are possible. Because the 0.01% elite (or less) needs some humans who can manage the Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems that may eventually run every facet of your life, from cars, to refrigerators, to food manufacturing and delivery, as well as medication that you have to take. “They” – these nefarious evil creatures – create some Alpha and Beta type humans to control and supervise AI-beings and their activities, so the robots won’t run amok with the world – and with the all-powerful, but utterly deceptive and vulnerable elite. For the elite, the sadistic evil creatures, it must remain paradise. Actually, happiness for everybody is needed, to avoid social upheaval. We may become a society, resembling Aldhous Huxley’s “Brave New World”.They, the Alphas and Betas, the upper echelons of the enslaved humanoids, have to make sure, that AI is not overrunning the elite, but will be kept under control.Hydrocarbon energy, oil and gas, may no longer be an issue. The price will be adjusted to the needs of the monopolistic demands. A reduced population will be using less energy. And since most is run by 5G and later even more efficiently by 6G – already in the making, and since there is really no competition anymore among the top monopolies, energy will be flowing amply – no price war is necessary.This is a doomsday scenario. One that Gates and his satanic cult would like to impose upon the world.Now let’s look at a good scenario, one that we the people have the power to make good. First, no complex projection of this type can ever be modeled and implemented over time, because dynamics take over. The world is alive. Anything that is alive cannot be directed by linearism (modelling is linear), but is subject to the laws of dynamics.Second, we, mankind are alive too, and we have the power to reverse this nefarious game plan of this evil cult that wants to dominate Mother Earth and all her creatures and the riches she hosts. It’s a question of waking up. And many people start seeing the light -perhaps in part because of this absurdity, this worldwide lockdown, this insanity of an endless thirst for power. Mother Earth is sick and tired of this abuse of the upper crust of society. She is stronger than the 0.01%. We, the people, can join Mother Earth, be on her side, and be safe.People start seeing the thought of utter destruction behind this fake epidemic, or according to WHO’s highly questionable leadership, a pandemic – a fear-mongering pandemic. We might as well call the corona virus, Virus “F” – for Fear. And yes, people can die of fear. WHO is dancing to the tune of the powerful, of Bill Gates, the Rockefellers, the pharma giants – and the behind-the-door (invisible) WEF-politicians and bankers. All this, under the pretext of saving the world from the invisible corona virus, from a pandemic that isn’t.We have enormous spiritual powers within us which we can mobilize to stem against the propaganda stream. In fact, the reason we are exposed to this type of ferocious propaganda, is precisely because the masters know about that strength of the human mind. And the way to immobilize it is through fear. That’s what’s happening.The longer this pathetic and oppressive Martial Law situation lasts (yes, in many countries, even Europe, Martial Law has become the state of the affair), the more this inner power and conviction of Self, of us, Sovereign Selves that we are, will resurface in humanity and displace the fear – to become a force to stand up against the evil forces, stand up for justice and for human equality, for human dignity – and ultimately for solidarity and love.\n",
      "Love is what makes us overcome this diabolical plan.That is the scenario of hope and love. Endless hope is hoping to the end, then the end will never come.

      "What is the true origin of the Wuhan coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, 2019nCoV, the CCP virus)? Many scientific publications seem to tell you that the virus was born from nature. How reliable are these publications? While, before I comment on that, I would like to bring out an important fact: all of such publications rely on a single evidence – the sequence of a bat coronavirus named RaTG13.RaTG13 looks like a “close cousin” of the Wuhan coronavirus – the two are 96% identical throughout the whole sequence of the viral genome. If RaTG13 is a nature- borne virus, one can comfortably conclude that the Wuhan coronavirus must very likely also come from nature and must share a recent common ancestor with RaTG13.But here is the problem: this RaTG13 virus isn’t real. The evidence of its existence, its sequence, was fabricated.Quite a claim, right? What is the claim based on? How can anyone fabricate a sequence? Who dares to carry out such a deceitful action and is not fearful of being caught? One is entitled to ask all of these questions. Now, let’s dig into each of them and see how the answers provided here may stand.Who dares to carry out such a deceitful action?The sequence of RaTG13 was reported by Zhengli Shi, a researcher of a Wuhan Institute of Virology and the biosafety level 4 (P4) lab for virology research. Dr. Shi is the top coronavirus expert in China. She has gained a nickname of “batwoman” because she and her team have a long history of capturing wild bats in caves all over for the purpose of detecting and sometimes isolating coronaviruses within them. As publicly stated, the goal of her research is to identify animal coronaviruses that have the potential of crossing-over to infect humans and thereby help the public avoiding SARS-like disasters in the future.Ironically, contrary to this self-portrait, since the very beginning of the current pandemic, Zhengli Shi has been singled out as THE suspect, who may have created the Wuhan coronavirus and, in doing so, caused a world-wide disaster. Interestingly, on Jan 23rd, 2020, just before this “rumor” started to soar though the roof, Shi published a paper in Nature (1), where she compared the freshly obtained sequence of the Wuhan coronavirus with those of other coronaviruses and thus delineated an evolutionary path of this new virus. In this publication, all of a sudden and out of nowhere, Shi reported this bat coronavirus, RaTG13, which pampered the public and seemingly helped shape ac onsensus in the field that the Wuhan coronavirus is of a natural origin.As stated in the paper, RaTG13 was discovered from Yunnan province, China, in 2013. According to credible sources, Shi has admitted to several individuals in the field that she does not have a physical copy of this RaTG13 virus. Her lab allegedly collected some bat feces in 2013 and analyzed these samples for possible presence of coronaviruses based on genetic evidence. To put it into plainer words, she has no physical proof for the existence of this RaTG13 virus. She only has its sequence information, which is nothing but a string of letters alternating between A, T, G, and C.Can the sequence of such a virus be fabricated? It cannot be any easier. It takes a person less than a day to TYPE such a sequence (less than 30000 letters) in a word file. And it would be a thousand times easier if you already have a template that is about 96% identical to the one you are trying to create. Once the typing is finished, one can upload the sequence onto the public database. Contrary to general conception, such database does not really have a way to validate the authenticity or correctness of the uploaded sequence. It relies completely upon the scientists themselves – upon their honesty and consciences. Once uploaded and released, such sequence data becomes public and can be used legitimately in scientific analysis and publications.Now, does this RaTG13 sequence qualify as credible evidence in judging the matter? Well, remember, a central part of the matter is whether or not this Wuhan coronavirus was engineered or created by ZHENGLI SHI. It is Shi, not anybody else, who is the biggest suspect of this possible crime that is grander than anything else in human history. Given the circumstances, wouldn’t she have a strong enough motive to be deceitful? If the evidence she raised to prove herself innocent was nothing but a bunch of letters recently typed in a word file, should anyone treat it as valid evidence?RaTG13, if truly exists, should never be neglected by Shi for a period of seven years.Let’s now think about this from another direction. The sequence of RaTG13 is highly alarming – it clearly shows a potential of the virus to infect humans.Within the spike protein of a β coronavirus, there is a critical piece named receptor- binding domain (RBD), which dictates whether or not this virus can use the ACE2 receptor on the surface of our cells and thereby infect humans. As a routine, when Shi’s team finishes collecting samples and confirms the presence of a coronavirus, the first thing they would do is to look at the sequence of the virus’ RBD. If there is resemblance between this sequence and that of the SARS virus (rarely so), their blood would boil because they have found something that may jump over to humans. It also means that top-journal publications are coming their way.In 2013, Shi made her fame in the coronavirus field by publishing in Nature two bat coronaviruses (Rs3367 and SHC014), which share considerable sequence similarity. with SARS in the RBD region (2). This work, for the first time, proved a bat origin of SARS. In the following years, her team continued to publish articles, featuring additional bat coronaviruses that share these important sequence motifs (3, 4).What does an RBD sequence look like? Figure 1 is the sequence comparison between SARS RBD and the RBDs of the bat coronaviruses that Zhengli Shi published in high- profile journals (2-4). Comparing to SARS (top), many bat coronaviruses (most of the ones in the bottom half) had substantial deletions in their RBDs and are thus likely defective in targeting humans. In contrast, some bat coronaviruses (upper half) not only resemble SARS in the completeness of the RBD sequences but also contain amino acids similar to their SARS counterparts at some of the five locations known to be critical for binding human ACE2 receptor. This group of viruses, with these dazzling features, were perceived by the field as breakthroughs.Figure1.SequencealignmentcomparingtheRBDsofSARS(top)andRaTG13(red arrow)toRBDsofbatcoronavirusesthatZhengliShipublishedinhigh-profilejournals from2013-2017(2-4).AminoacidresidueshighlightedbyShiascriticalforbinding humanACE2receptor(2)arelabeledinredtextontop.Alignmentwasdoneusingthe MultAlinwebserver(http://multalin.toulouse.inra.fr/multalin/).How does RaTG13, which was discovered in 2013, compare to these most cherished collections of Shi’s?By appearance, RaTG13 clearly belongs to the “good-looking” group. It rivals with the best ones in its completeness of the RBD sequence as well as in the conservation of critical amino acids. While a single amino acid insertion is observed, it occurs in a variable region and can be easily tolerated without affecting the protein function.Importantly, RaTG13 preserves the binding motifs as much as, if not better than, any other bat coronavirus in Shi’s list. At position 442, RaTG13 has a “L”, which beats most, if not all, bat viruses in resembling the “Y” in SARS RBD (“L” and “Y” both mediate hydrophobic interactions). At position 472, RaTG13 is the only bat coronavirus that has the residue “L”, which is identical to SARS. Although the amino acids at the other three positions are not identical to their counterparts in SARS, they are all conservative mutations, which may not negatively impact the protein’s function.As an expert as Shi is, she only needed to take one peek at the sequence of RaTG13’s RBD and immediately realize: this virus closely resembles SARS in its RBD and has a clear potential of infecting humans. If Shi’s public statement is true and she indeed intends to discover bat coronaviruses with a potential to cross-over to humans, how could she possibly overlook this extremely interesting finding of RaTG13? If this RaTG13 was discovered SEVEN years ago in 2013, why did Shi not publish this astonishing finding earlier and yet let the “less-attractive” viruses take the stage? Why did she decide to publish such a sequence only when the current outbreak took place and people started questioning the origin of the Wuhan coronavirus?None of these makes sense. These facts only add to the suspicion – Zhengli Shi either was directly involved in the creation of this virus/bioweapon, or helped cover it up, or both.Of course, these facts also add to the claim that RaTG13 is a fake virus – it exists on Nature (the journal) but not in nature.A closer look at the gene sequence of RaTG13’s spike reveals clear evidence of human manipulation. To assist our analysis here, we have to first understand one basic feature of natural evolution.When a gene (composed of nucleotides) is being translated into a protein (composed of amino acids), every three consecutive nucleotides constitute a codon and each codon encodes a particular amino acid (Figure 2). On the other hand, an amino acid typically corresponds to four codons, although some amino acids have one or two more and some one or two less (you can learn more about this here: https://passel2.unl.edu/view/lesson/3ccee8500ac8/6). What does it mean? It means that, when a nucleotide has changed (or in other words a single nucleotide substitution has occurred), the codon is certainly altered but the corresponding amino acid may or may not change. This is because the new codon may encode the same amino acid as the old codon does. A single nucleotide substitution that results in NO change of the amino acid is referred to as a synonymous mutation. A single nucleotide substitution that leads to a change in amino acid is called a non-synonymous mutation. When evolution takes place through random mutations, on average, every six nucleotide changes result in the change of one amino acid. In other words, on average and under normal conditions, the ratio between the number of synonymous mutations and that of non-synonymous mutations should be around 5:1.Now let’s further illustrate such a relationship using an example. In Figure 3A, synonymous and non-synonymous mutations are counted when the gene sequences of the spike proteins from two closely related bat coronaviruses, ZC45 and ZXC21 (6) are compared. The green curve depicts how the number of the synonymous mutation grows (Y axis) when the codons are analyzed sequentially (X axis). The red curve represents the trend of non-synonymous mutations. As expected, there are more synonymous mutations than non-synonymous mutations. Importantly, a correlation between the two curves is clearly present: they climb up and go through plateaus in a roughly synchronized manner. Throughout the whole length of the gene, at any point, the ratio between the accumulated synonymous and non-synonymous mutations is maintained at around 5:1. As described in the preceding paragraph, these features are consistent with what is the expected when two lineages closely relate to each other evolutionarily and the differences in their sequences are results of random mutations.Figure3.Comparingthenucleotidesequencesofdifferentspikeproteinsonthe synonymousmutations(greencurve)andnon-synonymousmutations(redcurve) revealsevidenceofhumanmanipulation.A.comparisonbetweentworelatedbat coronavirusesZC45(MG772933)andZXC21(MG772934),whicharenature-borne.B. comparisonbetweentheWuhancoronavirus(NC_045512)andRaTG13(MN996532) showsapatterninconsistentwithnaturalevolution.Sequencealignmentwasdone usingEMBOSSNeedle.SynonymousNon-synonymousAnalysiswasperformedusing SNAPatwww.hiv.lanl.gov. Does this hold true for RaTG13 and the Wuhan coronavirus? Not really.Figure 3B is the same comparative analysis done between RaTG13 and the Wuhan coronavirus. One thing you can immediately appreciate is that, in the second half of the sequence, while the green curve continues to grow steadily, the red curve stays flat. For a region as wide as over 700 amino acids (corresponding to 2100 nucleotides), which is statistically substantial, the synchronization between the two curves is non-existent.Surprisingly, or maybe not so surprisingly, at the end, the final counts of synonymous and non-synonymous mutations yield a ratio of just over five, consistent with what’s expected out of natural evolution.Let’s bring out some numbers to help us better comprehend the difference here. Let’s focus on the S2 protein, the second half of the spike ranging from 684 to 1273 (numbering according to the Wuhan coronavirus). Detailed analysis of this region reveals that, between ZC45 and ZXC21, a total of 32 nucleotides have changed and 5 of them lead to amino acid mutations (27 synonymous mutations vs. 5 non-synonymous mutations). It is, again, consistent with the scenario of natural evolution: every six nucleotide changes result in the change of one amino acid; synonymous/non- synonymous ratio is about 5:1. In contrast, for the same S2 region, between the Wuhan coronavirus and RaTG13, there are a total of 90 nucleotide changes and only two amino acid mutations. Here, every 45 nucleotide changes correspond to one amino acid change. The synonymous/non-synonymous ratio is 44:1.It is noteworthy that ZC45 and ZXC21 share ~97% sequence identity, just like that between the Wuhan coronavirus and RaTG13. So, the above comparison is very proper and reliable.If a person is studying the sequence differences between the Wuhan coronavirus and RaTG13 and yet pays attention only to the overall synonymous/non-synonymous ratio for the spike sequence, nothing would look strange. However, if one digs out as much details as shown in Figure 3, any person with a reasonable mind would say that something is clearly wrong.What is the best way to interpret this? A safe conclusion is that, between the Wuhan coronavirus and RaTG13, at least one is non-natural. If one is natural, then the other one must be no. Of course, the other possibility also exists – neither of them came from nature.If the Wuhan coronavirus is non-natural, then we have reached the end of our investigation.In fact, the Wuhan coronavirus may “look” natural even if it is a bioweapon because it is most likely made by using a natural coronavirus as a template. This would lead to a conclusion that the RaTG13 is non-natural, which is consistent with the facts we have brought up earlier: no physical copies of the virus exist and the sequence is highly likely fabricated. How could Zhengli Shi fail so badly in fabricating the RaTG13 sequence? When I said it was easy to type out a fake sequence that is 96% identical to a template, I did not say that it is easy to maintain a reasonable synonymous/non-synonymous ratio throughout the whole genome. Unfortunately for Shi, when she had to come up a good sequence for S1 and the RBD within it (she knows that this part will be scrutinized the most), she had somehow exhausted the number of non-synonymous mutations she could use here. To maintain a reasonable synonymous/non-synonymous ratio for the whole Spike- encoding gene (we can actually give her some credit here as she did remember to get it close to 5:1), she had to strictly limit the number of non-synonymous mutations in the S2 half of spike, which ended up flattening the red curve. It is hard to be a cheater after all.A deeper reason that Shi and the CCP needs the cover of RaTG13. Hopefully you are now as convinced as I am in that the RaTG13 sequence is indeed a fabrication. The first thing we should do then is to discredit any scientific publication, which based its analysis on the RaTG13 sequence and subsequently arrived at the conclusion that the Wuhan coronavirus is of natural origin. When you do a clean-up like that, you will see that there is practically nothing left.Next, we can look back to see what other coronaviruses are close to the Wuhan coronavirus in terms of sequence similarity. It turns out the two bat viruses featured in Figure 3A, ZC45 and ZXC21, are the next hits, each sharing 95% amino acid sequence identity (~89% nucleotide identity) with the Wuhan coronavirus. What is striking is the manner that the Wuhan coronavirus resembles these two bat coronaviruses – while every other protein remains highly identical, the S1 part of Spike, which dictates host selection, is only 69% identical. I have posted an article earlier, where I thoroughly analyzed this pattern and discussed how it is interlocked with the Wuhan coronavirus being a bioweapon made with ZC45 or ZXC21 as a template (www.nerdhaspower.weebly.com).One thing we haven’t mentioned so far is that ZC45 and ZXC21 are bat coronaviruses discovered, collected, and published by a military research lab of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) (6). They are owned only by the CCP. Now you may be able to appreciate the full benefits that the CCP creates by reporting a fake RaTG13 virus with a fabricated sequence – it would just be too obvious otherwise.Finally, I would like to add an additional piece of evidence, which was brought up in a comment of my earlier article by someone who is clearly an expert. It, in my opinion, hugely strengthens the claim that the Wuhan coronavirus is of non-natural origin.The E protein of β coronaviruses is a structural protein that is tolerant of mutations as evidenced both in SARS and in bat coronaviruses. However, on the amino acid level, E protein of the Wuhan coronavirus identified at the beginning of the outbreak is 100% identical to those of the suspected templates, ZC45 and ZXC21 What is striking is that, after a short two-months spread of the virus in humans, the E protein is already mutated. Sequence data obtained within the month of April indicate that mutations have occurred to four different locations (Figure 4). Note that the E protein makes very limited interactions with host proteins and thus is not under evolutionary pressure to adapt to a new host. Not only the E protein can tolerate mutations but also its mutational rate is held constant across different coronavirus species. The fact that the E protein of the Wuhan coronaviruses is already mutated in the short period of human-to-human transmission is consistent with its evolutionary feature. In stark contrast, while ZC45/ZXC21 and the Wuhan coronavirus are more distant evolutionarily, the E proteins within them are 100% identical. In no way this could be a result of natural evolution.RaTG13 – the Undeniable Evidence That the Wuhan Coronavirus Is Man-Made\n",

      "Coronavirus is spreading to more and more countries and leaving an increasing number of deaths in its wake. It is about time experts and the common men asked legitimate questions: “Where did this deadly virus come from, in what laboratories was it created, and who is behind the pandemic?”. We will try to answer them as objectively as possible. The first country where the novel coronavirus was detected and that actively began to stop its spread was China. When residents of the city of Wuhan began to get infected and die, the Chinese authorities warned the global community about the danger and started its full-on battle against the virus. Many nations in the world immediately offered to help China and quickly began working on the cure for COVID-19. But what did the current U.S. administration do in the wake of the outbreak? Some U.S. media outlets started accusing China of unleashing the virus. A number of articles followed pointing to China as the origin of the virus. The author was left with the impression that either these journalists had witnessed its creation or they had been carefully instructed as to what to write. A seafood market in Wuhan was also mentioned as the source of the virus. There were also stories suggesting that the unexpected appearance of the novel coronavirus hinted at it being man-made, and that people could have used the theory the virus had come from animals to hide the true nature of its origins. People who think they are intelligent and astute know for sure that only thieves and fraudsters make the biggest noise as they flee from those who they have stolen from or deceived. And this is exactly what some U.S. conspiracy theorists did, out of sheer stupidity, as they do not care about being objective and, instead, only strive for publicity and wider reach. Then, in the author’s opinion, more serious analytical articles were published insinuating that the new virus was created by biologists from the military and originated in U.S. laboratories. In short, they said that as a result of experiments, the coronavirus genome appeared to contain “HIV virus-like insertions”. According to the biologists responsible for the research, the virus was not a product of evolution or mutation even theoretically speaking. Hence, they concluded it could have been man-made. Dr. Eric Feigl-Ding also addressed this issue by posting: “I am absolutely not saying it’s bioengineering nor am I supporting any conspiracy theories with no evidence. I’m simply saying scientists need to do more research + get more data. And finding the origin of the virus is an important research priority”. A professor of Molecular Biology in New Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University, Anand Ranganathan, and his colleagues published a preprint (which has not been peer-reviewed as yet) about their research on the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). They discovered a possible link between it and other similar known coronaviruses circulating in animals (such as bats and snakes), and found HIV virus-like insertions in 2019-nCoV. No other well-studied coronaviruses have such a structure. Hence, their research hints at the possibility that the virus was designed and could be used to wage biological warfare. In light of these recent developments, it seems apt to remind our readers that a fierce, take-no-prisoners type of trade war is currently ongoing between the United States and China. And in the midst of this confrontation, as if by a wave of a magic wand, the coronavirus outbreak started in the PRC, which has already caused enormous damage to the Chinese economy and considerably weakened Beijing’s bargaining position at the negotiating table. Even before the coronavirus pandemic, many experts reported that, recently, Washington, in contravention of international law, was actively developing biological weapons in its numerous laboratories located in the United States as well as abroad. Apparently, there are more than 200 U.S. biological laboratories worldwide: in Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Uzbekistan and Ukraine. Incidentally, the author has come across articles published by Ukrainian media outlets claiming that local authorities have no oversight of such facilities. It seems that the situation in a number of other countries where U.S. biolabs are located is similar. DTRA (the Defense Threat Reduction Agency), which collaborates with the Richard Lugar Center for Public Health Research in Georgia, is suspected of involvement in an incident that occurred in Chechnya in spring 2017. Locals reported seeing a drone that appeared to be spreading a white powder near Russia’s border with Georgia. Ethnic bioweapons (biogenetic weapons), “is a type of theoretical bioweapon that aims to harm only or primarily people of specific ethnicities or genotypes”. Although there have never been any reports confirming that research on such weapons exists, documents that the author has come across show that the United States is gathering information about certain ethnic groups, first and foremost Russians and the Chinese. After all, Washington has labelled Russia and China as its main rivals recently. The author believes that the U.S. Air Force has been collecting Russian RNA (ribonucleic acid) and sinus tissue samples from a federal initiative. Apparently, information about this can be found in the Federal Procurement Data System. According to Article 8 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court biological experiments are deemed as war crimes. However, the United States is not a member of the Court and has a tendency to evade responsibility for war crimes. From the author’s perspective, there is a hidden motive behind the coronavirus pandemic. And as some have already guessed, it is not the Great Plague of the XXI century but a highly contagious disease that appeared at just the right time. In other words, the pandemic is part of a far-reaching disinformation campaign aimed at creating panic and chaos. According to Chinese conspiracy theories, the virus appeared in Wuhan during the Military World Games, which U.S. and British servicemen took part in. The author believes that there were many agents from the CIA and MI6 who could have released the coronavirus at the time thus putting everyone’s lives at risk. Incidentally, the British could have played an important role in this mission as they have already gained similar experience by spreading biological agents from the Porton Down science park near the city of Salisbury. The poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia lends further credence to the author’s theory as they managed to survive the ordeal. There are over 400000 confirmed COVID-19 cases globally, and millions more are worried about the pandemic. What is curious to the author is that not only are the common men in a panic but so are authorities and officials who are preparing to take unprecedented quarantine measures in Russia, China, Iran and other nations that are known to choose their own path. The information war has served as a catalyst to the crisis that could have been smaller in scale but thanks to manipulation of mass consciousness, this is no longer the case. The author thinks that the current disinformation campaign accompanying the coronavirus pandemic is the beginning of the “heist of the century”. As a result of this con, assets and savings of many nations, companies and individuals will end up in the hands of the current oligarchy, more specifically hundreds of the richest and most powerful families.  The substantial portion of global wealth they already own will only increase as the rich always want more. From the author’s point of view, the United States is accustomed to robbing other countries and people of their wealth, and their allies are no exception, take Italy for example.Coronavirus: the Reactionaries from USA\n",

      "Intravenous vitamin C is already being employed in China against COVID-19 coronavirus. I am receiving regular updates because I am part of the Medical and Scientific Advisory Board to the International Intravenous Vitamin C China Epidemic Medical Support Team.Direct report from China\n",
      "OMNS Chinese edition editor Dr. Richard Cheng is reporting from China about the first approved study of 12000 to 24000 mg/day of vitamin C by IV. The doctor also specifically calls for immediate use of vitamin C for prevention of coronavirus (COVID-19). A second clinical trial of intravenous vitamin C was announced in China on Feb. 13th. In this second study, says Dr. Cheng, \"They plan to give 6000 mg/day and 12000 mg/day per day for moderate and severe cases. We are also communicating with other hospitals about starting more intravenous vitamin C clinical studies. We would like to see oral vitamin C included in these studies, as the oral forms can be applied to more patients and at home.\" And on Feb 21, 2020, announcement has been made of a third research trial now approved for intravenous vitamin C for COVID-19. Dr. Cheng, who is a US board-certified specialist in anti-aging medicine, adds: \"Vitamin C is very promising for prevention, and especially important to treat dying patients when there is no better treatment. Over 2000 people have died of the COIV-19 outbreak and yet I have not seen or heard large dose intravenous vitamin C being used in any of the cases. The current sole focus on vaccine and specific antiviral drugs for epidemics is misplaced.\"\n",
      "He adds that: \"Early and sufficiently large doses of intravenous vitamin C are critical. Vitamin C is not only a prototypical antioxidant, but also involved in virus killing and prevention of viral replication. The significance of large dose intravenous vitamin C is not just at antiviral level. It is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that kills most people from coronaviral pandemics (SARS, MERS and now NCP). ARDS is a common final pathway leading to death.\"We therefore call for a worldwide discussion and debate on this topic.\"News of vitamin C research for COVID-19 is being actively suppressed\n",
      "Anyone saying that vitamin therapy can stop coronavirus is already being labeled as \"promoting false information\" and promulgating \"fake news.\" Even the sharing of verifiable news, and direct quotes from credentialed medical professionals, is being restricted or blocked on social media. You can see sequential examples of this phenomenon at my Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/themegavitaminman. Indeed, the World Health Organization (WHO) has, literally, met with Google and Facebook and other media giants to stop the spread of what they declare to be wrong information.Physician-directed, hospital-based administration of intravenous vitamin C has been marginalized or discredited. Scientific debate over COVID-19 appears to not be allowed.Ironically, Facebook, blocking any significant users' sharing of the news of approved vitamin therapy research, is itself blocked in China by the Chinese government. As for the internet, yes, China has it. And yes, it is censored. But, significantly, the Chinese government has not blocked this real news on how intravenous vitamin C will save lives in the COVID-19 epidemic. Here is the protocol as published in Chinese. Medical orthodoxy obsessively focuses on searching for a vaccine and/or drug for coronavirus COVID-19).

      "In earlier articles I related the opinions of biochemists and bio-warfare specialists on the circumstances justifying suspicion of a virus being created in a lab and deliberately released in a foreign country as a means of either low- or high-intensity warfare, or as merely a means of destabilising a nation and perhaps severely damaging its economy, with the loss of life being an added plus. The US is the country that appears most devoted to biological warfare, though a number of other nations are eager participants, including the UK and Israel.I would remind readers here of the statement from PNAC, in a report titled, “Rebuilding America’s Defenses”, that “Advanced forms of biological warfare that can ‘target’ specific genotypes may transform biological warfare … to a politically useful tool.”This subject is difficult to discuss openly in a nation of people, or even within international bodies like the UN. The infliction of such a pathogen onto a nation is clearly an act of war. However, if the leaders have not irrefutable proof of a bio-weapon and its source, and are not prepared for a military response, the only solution is to remain silent and emphasise research on defensive measures in the event of a recurrence. Even with overwhelming circumstantial evidence, a public statement or an accusation would likely be derided as yet another unfounded conspiracy theory. This is essentially the same with disclosure to the UN General Assembly or other such body; an accusation lacking conclusive proof would merely be derided and embarrassing.This is similarly true with destabilization and violence, as China has very recently experienced in Hong Kong (and which has not yet stabilized), and the violence in Tibet and Xinjiang. The American ‘black  hand’ (from the American consulate) was caught red-handed in Hong Kong and sources of funding the HK terrorists are now being identified. There is no dispute anywhere that the violence and terrorism in both Tibet and Xinjiang were American-inspired and funded, but absolute irrefutable proof is lacking. All of these are clearly acts of war but, lacking final proof, responses are limited to defensive measures.In a previous article on China’s new coronavirus, I referred to a thesis on Biological Weapons by Leonard Horowitz and Zygmunt Dembek who stated that clear signs of a genetically-engineered bio-warfare agent were (a) a disease caused by an uncommon (unusual, rare, or unique) agent, with (b) lack of an epidemiological explanation, i.e. no clear idea of source; (c) An “unusual manifestation and/or geographic distribution”, such as race-specificity; and (d) multiple sources of infection.China’s coronavirus appears to satisfy all four criteria. This is especially true since it appears that only one Caucasian (and some Japanese) has been infected to date, with the virus so far appearing to be tightly focused to Chinese.Also the statement by Dr. Leonard Horowitz who quoted one military expert as saying “Even if you suspect biological terrorism, it’s hard to prove. It’s equally hard to disprove . . . You can trace an arms shipment, but it’s almost impossible to trace the origins of a virus that comes from a bug.” Another expert stated  that a properly-done release of an infectious agent cannot be traced to its source and might be considered an “act of God”.In 2003, many Russian medical experts voiced the opinion that the SARS virus was most likely man-made and deliberately released as a weapon. Sergei Kolesnikov, a member of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, said the propagation of the SARS virus might well have been caused by leaking a combat virus grown in bacteriological weapons labs because the natural compound [of contained virus genome sections] was impossible, that the mix could never appear in nature, but could be done only in a laboratory.China’s New Coronavirus: An Examination of the Facts. At the same time, Nikolai Filatov, the head of Moscow’s epidemiological services, stated he believed SARS was man-made because “there is no vaccine for this virus, its make-up is unclear, it has not been very widespread and the population is not immune to it.” It appears the Russians may be arriving at the same conclusion for China’s new virus in 2020. The text below consists of a condensed version of an interview conducted by the Russian news portal mk.ru, on January 27, 2020, with Igor Nikulin, a former member of the UN Commission on Biological and Chemical Weapons. The article begins by noting that the prevalence of the coronavirus in China is increasing, while Beijing takes extraordinary measures to reduce the impact of this disaster. It further states that a number of experts “note strange coincidences in the circumstances” of the emergence of this new infection and are reluctant to exclude an “artificial origin”. Mr. Nikulin was asked to comment on the situation.With regard to the interview, we should emphasize that at this juncture of the coronavirus pandemic there is no firm evidence of the use of biological weapons against the People’s Republic of China. This Russian viewpoint is not fully corroborated.  Translated  from Russian. \n",
      "Russian Expert: “We Cannot Rule Out Man Made Origin of these Infections”Interviewer: in recent years dangerous for humans coronaviruses appear more and more often. What does this have to do with anything?Nikulin: With these coronaviruses, the situation is really very strange. Until 2000, none of them “jumped on a person.” They have been living next to humans for millions of years, but always only on some animals parasitized. For example, on camels, as in the case of [MERS]. Or on bats, birds, anyone, but this infection did not pass on to a person. And there are already 8 deadly viruses in 20 years. It’s obviously too much.Interviewer: So we can’t rule out the man-made origin of these infections?Nikulin: If it was the first outbreak, you’d think it was a natural mutation. But it is hardly natural, because every few years such incidents are repeated. It’s atypical pneumonia, it’s avian flu, it’s swine flu, it’s something else.Interviewer: Some experts note that the time of the outbreak in China seems to be chosen specifically to cause maximum harm. Just on the eve of the New Year on the Eastern calendar, when in China mass internal migration for the holidays, as well as events with the participation of a large number of people. And the place seemed to be specially [selected]. Historically and geographically, all roads in China lead to Wuhan. It is the largest transport hub, the largest international airport. Through it [planes] fly to the States, Australia, Japan, the Middle East, Paris, London, Moscow. Besides these coincidences, what can prove the artificial origin of the virus?”Nikulin: Just deciphering the genome. Its results may show if it is a virus of natural origin, or laboratory, when some recombinant “piece” is inserted into the gene . . . there are modern computer programs [that] allow you to read all this, decipher and compare with the samples available in databases.Interviewer: Is it possible that the new coronavirus only affects people of Chinese nationality? So it’s set on certain features of the human gene?Nikulin: If it turns out that this is indeed the case, then such a natural mutation cannot be accurate. It’s mathematical proof that it’s an artificially created virus.\n",
      "Interviewer: In which labs can it appear?Nikulin: I can only assume. But look: China, like Russia, is surrounded by American research biolaboratories. They are in different countries along the perimeter of China’s borders – in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Taiwan, Philippines, South Korea, Japan. They were in Indonesia, but they closed them. And wherever there are these American biolaboratories, or near them, there are outbreaks of new diseases, often unknown. Threats to the local population are simply ignored by Americans. The main thing is that it was away from the territory of the United States.Interviewer: How many foreign biolaboratories do the U.S. have?Nikulin: It’s 400.Interviewer: They are overseen by the Pentagon?Nikulin: Of course. It’s all funded from the Pentagon budget. Therefore, it is not necessary to say that peaceful humanitarian research is being carried out there. Do you think the Pentagon’s money is being spent on peaceful research? No one is allowed in. These are military labs. When more than a hundred people died in Georgia near such a laboratory within one month, do you think someone was allowed to go there? No one was allowed into the American laboratory at all.\n",
      "Those countries that consider themselves victims of bioterrorism should investigate all these cases and bring them up for international discussion. For example, to the UN Security Council. To raise the issue of the activities of American biolaboratories outside the United States. We have to do something. Because a lot of people are already suffering from it. And in general, it is necessary to strengthen the biosecurity of the country.China’s Coronavirus. “We Cannot Rule Out Man Made Origin of these Infections”\n",

This kind of misdiagnosis and under-diagnosis by physicians everywhere has occurred over several decades regarding Electrohypersensitivity illness, often by the intentional design of the Medical-Big Pharma Complex.Then there are those individuals who suffer from both 5G Flu and early-onset 5G Syndrome; they’re the ones dropping like flies in Wuhan, China. Their addiction to smartphones and other wireless devices blinded them to the adverse health effects caused by the sudden influx of 5G energies (which include extremely high radiofrequency signal ranges and ultra-strong microwave transmissions) when they flipped the switch in 2019 in Hubei Province.\n",
      "In general, 5G Flu is more of an acute illness whereas 5G Syndrome is a long-term, chronic disease. They mutually support and feed off each other which is what makes them so dangerous and increasingly fatal. A person who has 5G Syndrome is much more susceptible to contracting 5G Flu. And, a person with 5G Flu is a good candidate for developing 5G Syndrome.One who repeatedly gets the Wuhan coronavirus (or 5G Flu), as many Chinese sufferers have to date, will exhibit a greater likelihood of developing 5G Syndrome; that is, if they don’t already have a case of it. The extraordinary re-infection rates for COVID-19, also known as the coronavirus bioweapon triggering 5G Flu, offer compelling circumstantial evidence that it’s really an electromagnetic radiation-driven disease more than a bioengineered coronavirus; although, it’s really both co-factors working in tandem to turbo-charge each other.Truly, the ‘inexplicable’ re-infection rates tell the hidden back story about this swiftly unfolding pandemic. The only plausible reason for multiple re-infections, when compared to all previously studied coronavirus outbreaks prior to the WiFi era, is that the former COVID-19 patients have stepped back into their wireless environment, they live in a 5G hotspot, they are creating their own IoT and/or they still sleep with their smartphones — TURNED ON — under their pillows.\n",
      "5G Syndrome insidiously develops over a period of sustained exposure to a 5G power grid and/or usage of even a small-scale version of a home-based IoT or a full-scale office build-out of the Internet of Things. The longer any individual sits in those unsafe levels of 5G-disseminated EMFs and microwaves, the more likely they will experience the evolution of their own unique form of 5G Syndrome. Eventually, they will become vulnerable to not only 5G Flu (i.e. Wuhan coronavirus), but also to the whole host of other bioengineered flu strains and naturally occurring influenzas.The most critical point here is that every long-term, habitual smartphone user is at great risk for developing either 5G Flu and 5G Syndrome, or both. During the annual flu seasons, they will be more susceptible than others to any type of influenza that passes through the neighborhood, especially one of the various coronaviruses.The symptoms of both. What will eventually follow in this blog is a list of symptoms of both 5G Flu and 5G Syndrome which will distinguish the one medical ailment from the other. Inevitably, there will be many symptoms that overlap for obvious reasons, but even those will have subtle differences to the trained clinician.This future list of 5G symptoms will by no means be exhaustive and will be added to in the weeks and months and years ahead. Its compilation represents a collaborative effort among many like-minded healthcare professionals and health advocates who deeply understand the intimate connection between the human bio-organism and ambient electromagnetic fields.These medical clinicians, alternative healthcare practitioners and biomedical researchers are especially aware of the numerous adverse health effects and profound environmental impacts produced by the rapidly emerging 5G power grid. Connecting the most crucial dots has become easier as the 5G roll-out takes place in cities nationwide as well as worldwide.China has provided an excellent observation laboratory with the Wuhan 5G Demonstration Zone being the most watched experiment in the world today. Some have even noted that the Wuhanese have sacrificed themselves for the sake of enlightening the rest of humanity. Now it’s time for the Chinese government to share the medical data and scientific observations so that their 5G roll-out can be properly implicated in this paralyzing public health crisis.There are many symptoms which constitute either the 5G Flu or 5G Syndrome symptom set, as well as those that are common to both. The due diligence process and proper vetting required to confirm them with a high level of integrity is quite tedious and challenging. Nevertheless, this project is proceeding with all deliberate speed in the interest of precluding a public health disaster of epic proportions. Our real intention is to avert a full-blown ELE (Extinction Level Event) in light of the 5G juggernaut rolling across the land on all 7 continents.The following two links provide just a glimpse into the enormity and gravity of this vast biomedical research project. This “Special Report” is very much a work-in-progress and will be posted in its entirety in the near future. One of the writer-researchers is also The Coronavirus Coach and, therefore, we are still identifying the various and sundry symptoms that define both 5G Flu and 5G Syndrome. In the meantime, every person who suspects that they suffer from either of these medical ailments, or if they have been medically diagnosed with COVID-19, ought to read the symptoms of EHS listed here: Electrohypersensitivity Syndrome: The Symptoms & Some Solutions.CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL REPORT: Worldwide Outbreaks of 5G Syndrome and 5G Flu Driving Pandemic\n",

      "A new documentary film by Epoch Times in collaboration with NTD (New Tang Dynasty Television), both based in New York, details additional concerning – and potentially horrifying – facts that the Wuhan coronavirus is a biological experiment that either escaped or was deliberately released (see at end of article). This comes as UK ministers are expressing doubt that the coronavirus originated from Wuhan’s Hunan Seafood market and rather insist that there is credible evidence it came from Wuhan’s lab, which also had U.S. funding.The documentary led by investigative reporter Joshua Philipp takes an in-depth look at the progression of the pandemic from January to April, and details how Shi Zhengli a virologist often called China’s “bat woman” altered studies throwing the world’s science community off the trail in order to support her claim that the Wuhan coronavirus virus (COVID-19) came from bats at the market. The film also dissects the virus in great detail exposing its spike (or S-proteins), which has layers of HIV included in it and its nucleoids, to the history of the Wuhan lab’s experiments on bats. Additional claims are made that China has covered up much of the earlier information about the virus, in some cases even ordering documents destroyed. The film by Philipp proves without a doubt, at least to this writer, that the virus is a biological escaped experiment.This is something that Activist Post has been raising as a strong possibility to readers, despite alternative press being attacked for claiming the virus displayed signs of being a biological weapon produced in a lab. Dr. Francis Boyle, a professor of international law at the University of Illinois College of Law, and the man who drafted the Biological Weapons Act of 1989, recently said in an explosive interview with Geopolitics and Empire that the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan likely came from the BSL-4 lab in the city.Boyle stated in the interview that he believes the virus is potentially lethal and an offensive biological warfare weapon or dual-use biowarfare weapons agent genetically modified with function properties. Boyle also touched on a fact this reporter stated previously — how Chinese biowarfare agents working at the Canadian lab in Winnipeg were involved in the smuggling of coronavirus to Wuhan’s lab in July of last year.Recently, scientists have now admitted and found that the coronavirus kills the immune system by attacking T-cells; This alludes to a confirmation of earlier reports retracted by Indian scientists that ZeroHedge reported which stated COVID-19 SARS2 had four new sequences matching HIV inserted into its spike or S-proteins. Dr. Judy Mikovits a molecular biologist and former director at the lab of Antiviral Mechanisms NCI, makes the same argument in Epoch Times‘ film, stating that: “the virus is certainly not natural, given the S-proteins and E-proteins.”Mikovits isn’t the only molecular biologist speaking out; Czech Dr. Sona Pekova is also working on the tests for the virus and stated that it’s likely an escaped lab experiment due to the modified proteins.Ministers in UK are now no longer dismissing the theory that the coronavius pandemic erupted due to a biological experiment gone wrong, or a deliberate release, The Dailymail reported. “There is a credible alternative view [to the zoonotic theory] based on the nature of the virus. Perhaps it is no coincidence that there is that laboratory in Wuhan. It is not discounted.” Cobra the emergency committee led by recently infected recovering Borris Johnson, said.Even the Pentagon, which had previously flatly dismissed the possibility, now seems at least open to other considerations according to a recent statement cited by Defense One:“There’s a lot of rumor and speculation in a wide variety of media, blog sites, etc.,” (Joint Chiefs Chairman) Milley said. “It should be no surprise to you that we have taken a keen interest in that, and we have had a lot of intelligence take a hard look at that.”“At this point it’s inconclusive, although the weight of evidence seems to indicate natural, but we do not know for sure,” Milley said.The approximate £30 million Wuhan Institute of Virology, based ten miles from the infamous wet market, is supposed to be one of the most secure virology labs in the world. A second institute in the city, the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention – is barely three miles from the accused market – is also believed to have carried out experiments on animals such as bats to examine the transmission of coronaviruses. The Wuhan Institute of Virology was involved in carrying out research on bats from the Yunnan caves which scientists believe is the original source of the outbreak, Dailymail reported.Beyond that, it has now emerged that several U.S. state department cables warned of safety issues of the lab, Washington Post reported.WaPo reports that the U.S State Department received two cables from U.S. Embassy officials in 2018 warning of inadequate safety at a Wuhan, China biolab conducting “risky studies” on bat coronaviruses, according to the Washington Post, which notes that the cables have “fueled discussions inside the U.S. government about whether this or another Wuhan lab was the source of the virus.” Interestingly enough, this coincides with a warning that same year from a major U.S. government report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine which warned that advances in synthetic biology now allow scientists to have the capability to recreate dangerous viruses from scratch; make harmful bacteria more deadly; and modify common microbes so that they churn out lethal toxins once they enter the body.It has also emerged that Wuhan’s Virology Institute was funded for 3.7 million by the NIH (National Institutes of Health) headed by none other than Anthony Fauci. Results of the research were published in November 2017 under the headline: “Discovery of a rich gene pool of bat SARS-related coronaviruses provides new insights into the origin of SARS coronavirus.”This may explain why despite the virus has been claimed to be airborne and able to spread a now reported 13 feet. Regardless, the U.S. or any country has refused to say the virus may be an escaped lab experiment. The FBI also discussed several suspicious encounters where Chinese nationals were trying to smuggle viruses out of the U.S., including a coronavirus, as Activist Post reported.This doesn’t include the case in January, where the head of Harvard University’s chemistry department, Charles Lieber, was federally charged with failing to disclose funding from the Chinese government, after he hid his involvement in China’s “Thousand Talents Program,” along with Chinese nationals. It also doesn’t include an incident in a Canadian lab in Winnipeg where coronavirus samples were smuggled to Wuhan’s lab in July of last year by a couple. Typically, Canadian and U.S. authorities work hand in hand; in 2001 after the September 11 attacks the agency established a permanent presence in Ottawa, Canada for terrorism and cross-border related cases.The FBI’s report also specifically uses the words, “biosecurity risk” when describing China, which is typically used to refer to the intentional misuse of pathogens, such as for bioterrorism and biosafety, which covers accidental release according to the World Heath Organization.The Lancet medical journal published a study finding that many of the first cases of the novel coronavirus, including suspected patient zero, had no connection to the wet market, leading many including Boyle to speculate with abundant evidence listed above that the virus may have been a bio accident. Lancet also makes note that there are no bats sold at the Wuhan Seafood market, as the CDC themselves admitted. Many suspect “patient zero” was actually Shi Zhengli’s assistant Huang Yan Ling, who has gone missing and was suspiciously removed from the Wuhan Institute of Virology’s website as Laowhy86 noted in a YouTube video investigating the coronavirus’s origins entitled: “I Found The Source of the Coronavirus.”Zhengli has denied that Ling was patient zero, expressing it was “fake news” that her or any other researcher was infected. However, Chinese media has continued the investigation whether or not patient zero was Ling or another researcher. South Chinese scientists have raised concerns as well, expressing that there were two separate lab incidents with the coronavirus-infected bats, one spilling blood and the other spilling urine on lab workers, as Activist Post reported.Ironically, one of those South Chinese scientists was Xio Botao, a researcher who purportedly knew Ling and called her in his report “Patient Zero.”It is worth noting the lab was officially working with different strains of coronavirus, as well as other deadly illnesses like Ebola, beginning in 2018. This lab is just a few miles away from the Huanan wet market where the first case of the coronavirus is believed to have been transmitted.Even before the lab opened, scientists all over the world were voicing concerns about the potential dangers. An article was published in the prestigious science journal Nature in 2017, detailing the plans for the lab and sharing expert opinions about how a dangerous bug could leak from the facility. In fact, the SARS virus has escaped from high-level containment facilities in Beijing multiple times.Interestingly enough, in 2004, China punished five top officials of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for the outbreak of SARS. The investigation found that the release of the virus was due to the negligence of two CDC employees who were infected and was not deliberate, China Daily reported.\n",
      "ZeroHedge pointed out that a job post from the Wuhan Virology Institute on November 18th , 2019 asked for researchers to “use bats to research the molecular mechanism that allows Ebola and SARS-associated coronaviruses to lie dormant for a long time without causing diseases.”What was missed at the time by many of us is that the same job post board has another shocking post on December 24th 2019, which states the following:Long-term research on the pathogenic biology of bats carrying important viruses has confirmed the origin of bats for major human and animal infectious diseases such as SARS and SADS, and discovered and identified a large number of new viruses in bats and rodents.\n",
      "In 2015, the National Library of Medicine published a paper warning that a “SARS-like cluster of circulating bat coronavirus pose threat for human emergence.” That same year, Nature published an article warning that a hybrid lab-created version of a bat coronavirus — one related to the virus that causes SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) — could cause a possible pandemic.In 2020, another paper was published in Nature, which claimed that the Wuhan coronavirus is closely related to (CoVZC45 and CoVZXC21) sampled from bats from Zhoushan by the People Liberation Army of China. The E-protein shows 100% amino acid similarity, which, according to Mikovitz, proves it is not a natural virus. Further, she adds, the S-proteins show a similarity to the original SARS.According to the documentary by Epoch Times and NTD, the following research further illustrates the origins of the Wuhan coronavirus.On January 23, 2020 the Wuhan virus exploded. While Wuhan announced the lockdown of the city, Dr. Shi Zhengli of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, published a paper in the authoritative science journal, Nature on February 3, 2020 stating that the Wuhan coronavirus was of probable bat origin. The paper indicated that the Wuhan virus utilized the same key as SARS to gain entry into the human body. She also announced the 2019-nCoV genome sequence was 96.2% consistent with a bat coronavirus originating in Yunnan, China, called RaTG13, signaling a natural source of the Wuhan virus.\n",
      "Since the SARS outbreak in 2003, Shi Zhengli had been conducting research on coronaviruses. From 2010 onward, the focus of Shi and her team, was redirected to identifying the capacity for coronavirus transmission across species, specifically putting the spotlight on the S protein of the coronaviruses. Her team’s research in the Wuhan virology lab, has been looking into the part that can make coronaviruses transmittable to humans.In June, 2010, a team including Shi Zhengli, published a paper. It described research to understand the susceptibility of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ACE-2 proteins, of different bat species to the S Protein of the SARS virus. In the experiments, they also modified key amino acid codons to mutate the bats ACE-2 to examine compatibility with the SARS S Protein. This paper demonstrated their awareness of the special relationship between the S Protein and the ACE-2 receptor. It also signified that Shi had unearthed the passageway for coronaviruses into human bodies.In October, 2013, Shi and her team published a paper in Nature. They claimed a breakthrough in coronavirus research. They successfully isolated three viruses from bats, one of which had a S Protein that integrated with human ACE-2 receptors. This effectively demonstrated the direct human infection of SARS-like viruses to humans, without the need of an intermediate host.Then in November, 2015, Shi and her team at the Wuhan virology lab once again published a paper. This time in the British journal, Nature Medicine. They discussed the creation of a synthetic virus, a self-replicating Chimeric virus. This virus had the SARS virus as the framework, with the key S protein replaced, by the one they had found in a bat coronavirus, she mentioned in her 2013 paper. This new virus demonstrated a powerful ability for cross-species infection.The mice infected with the synthetic virus revealed severe lung damage with no cure. This symbolized that Shi’s successful splicing of the SARS virus, was a key to open the door to the cross-species transmission. They planned to further experiment on primates, although Shi Zhengli did not indicate any conclusion from this research. Her move to research on primates wasn’t done without controversy. Shi’s experiments quickly triggered widespread debates from the academic community. Simon Wain-Hobson of the Pasteur Institute in France, expressed deep concerns. He told Nature, “If the new virus escaped, nobody could predict the trajectory. Propagation could happen anywhere.Symptoms of the coronavirus include a fever, cough, shortness of breath, and other breathing difficulties. However, according to Chinese state media, some are not experiencing any of these symptoms and are instead experiencing nausea, diarrhea, tiredness, bad concentration, headache, irregular heartbeat, chest pain, cornea inflammation, and muscular pains in the limbs, back, and waist. There are also emerging suspected symptoms; for example, French scientists have warned that COVID-19 may cause dermatological problems such as hives, painful red skin and a condition similar to frostbite.Best preventive measures include washing your hands, and avoiding public places where someone may be sick, according to the CDC.Since the virus outbreak was officially announced in January, scientists have found a multitude of everlasting damage caused to our bodies including but not limited to — heart problems, liver damage, kidney damage, brain damage, and lung damage. This has many scientists and doctors perplexed and worried about the coronavirus and its effects on our current and future health. British scientific advisers have even estimated the pandemic may be as much as 15 to 40 times worse than what China has said.According to a leaked audio recording by Epoch Times, a Chinese military expert who spoke to military medics revealed that in recovered patients, the immune system is totally destroyed and they could remain contagious. He added, “do not expect a vaccine, let me tell you. Do not expect there’ll be a vaccine. Those who talked about how vaccines can be developed are all charlatans. Those who have been infected will have a lot of trouble. (Now that it has spread far and wide,) what’s next, how it will develop later, no one has a clue. This virus, in fact, is how humans are going to self-destruct. There is absolutely nothing we can do about it.” However, he added, that the only solution is to “increase your own personal immunity.”Moreover, the South China Morning Post issued a new warning to lab technicians around the world. According to French scientists in a new (non-peer-reviewed) paper, they had to bring the temperature almost to a boiling point in order to kill the virus.Professor Remi Charrel and colleagues at the Aix-Marseille University in southern Franceheated the virus that causes Covid-19 to 60 degrees Celsius (140 Fahrenheit) for an hour and found that some strains were still able to replicate.China lied about SARS previously, which was a biological accident 3 out of the 4 times according to the World Health Organization. So, with all this evidence pointing back to China, using Occam’s razor we can determine that the virus more than likely leaked from Wuhan Institute of Virology, especially given the infectious spread infecting every country in the world in a matter of months.Ironically, and something you can take as predictive programming or a warning from Hollywood, the 2011 movie Contagion is about a bat coronavirus which escapes China and ravages the world without a cure according to IMDB.However, as Activist Post wrote while discussing the increase of a police surveillance state, measures being put into place now will likely remain long after the pandemic has stopped and the virus has run its course. That’s the everlasting effect that COVID-19 will have on our society. Essentially, we are entering COVID-1984. The coronavirus is now classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization, and it may very well be a legitimate health concern for all of us around the world and the virus itself may be an escaped lab experiment as this article details. But it’s the government’s response that should worry us all more in the long run like increased phone surveillance and talking “pandemic drones.”You can watch the full investigative documentary by the Epoch Times and NTD entitled: “Tracking Down the Origin of the Wuhan Coronavirus” below.New Evidence CV Is An Escaped Experiment; U.S. Funded Wuhan Lab\n",

      "From conspiracy theory to geopolitical realism, the possibility to treat COVID-19 as a biological weapon has been finally accepted in the public sphere. The recent statement by the Chinese spokesman Zhao Lijian, formally accusing the US of bringing coronavirus to China, has highlighted a series of new opinions about the pandemic.The hypothesis of biological warfare behind the global pandemic had already been raised by Russian experts some weeks ago. Like any opinion that is slightly different from the official version of Western governments and their media agencies, the thesis was ridiculed and accused of being a “conspiracy theory”. However, as soon as the official spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the second largest economic power on the planet publishes a note attesting to this possibility, it leaves the sphere of “conspiracy theories” to enter the scene of public opinion and official government versions.In addition to making the explanation of biological warfare official, Zhao Lijian raised important questions about the pandemic data in the USA: “When did patient zero begin in US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!”The supreme leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ayatollah Khomeini, ordered on the same day of the declaration of the Chinese Ministry the creation of a unified center of scientific research specialized in the fight against the coronavirus. The motivation, according to the Iranian spiritual and political leader, was motivated by evidence that the pandemic is a biological attack. These are his words:“The establishment of a headquarters to fight the outbreak [of COVID-19] occurs due to the presence of evidence that indicates the possibility of a biological attack, signaling that it is necessary that all coping services [to the coronavirus] be under the command of a unified headquarters”.In fact, what the mainstream Western media has called a “conspiracy” has been manifested in US defense programs for a long time. We must briefly recall the official document named “Rebuilding America’s Defenses”, published by the conservative think tank “Project for a new American Century”, where we can clearly read: “(…) advanced forms of biological warfare that can target specific genotypes may transform biological warfare from the realm of terror to a politically useful tool “.Taking into account that the document was published in 2000, we can see that the possibility of biological warfare has been carefully considered and worked on by American strategists for at least two decades. However, the projects are even older. This article published in Global Research tells a brief history of biological warfare technology, tracing the remote origins of this practice by the American armed forces. In this genealogy of biological warfare, we find reports of the use of bio-weapons in wars in great conflicts of the last century, such as the Second World War, the Korea War and the conflicts with Cuba. Even so, until last Thursday, the mere fact of mentioning this hypothesis for the new coronavirus was rejected as conspiracy.We must attain to concrete data: Pentagon has 400 military laboratories around the world, whose activities are still obscure; the USA has not yet made a clear statement about the COVID-19 data in its territory, having not yet informed the identity of its patient zero and maintaining uncertain information about the number of infected; Chinese scientists conducted a complex study in which they concluded that the virus did not originate in China, but that it had multiple and diverse sources from the Huanan marine seafood market from where the virus subsequently spread.In February, the Japanese media agency Ashi TV reported that the virus originated in the U.S., not China, and that Washington would be omitting its actual numbers, with some cases of death attributed to influenza being, in fact, camouflaged cases of coronavirus; on February 27, a Taiwanese virologist presented a series of flowcharts on a TV program, corroborating the thesis that the virus has an American origin, providing a scientific explanation to the flow of the virus sources devoid of any geopolitical purpose.Another curious fact is that China has been unexpectedly affected by epidemic phenomena, particularly during the period of the trade war between Beijing and Washington. Only between 2018 and the beginning of 2020, the country recorded epidemic episodes of H7N4, H7N9 (two variations of bird flu) and African swine flu. Also, the US has not officially responded to any of these notes, remaining silent about the coronavirus situation in its territory.Not proposing a concrete answer, but only speculations, we can consider that the circumstances of the case present us a very extensive list of possibilities about what in fact the coronavirus is. Obviously, it is possible that it is not a biological weapon – and this is the official version of most of the media agencies and governments – however, once this hypothesis has been raised and no concrete evidence to the contrary is presented, it is also possible that it is a biological weapon.The most important thing to do is to dispel the myth that biological wars are conspiracy theories. We must begin to take this possibility seriously and analyze the evidences in search of real solutions. Biological weapons are methods that have long been used and that form a fundamental part of modern warfare, whose costs are less than the methods of direct confrontation of the old wars of mobilization – and whose benefits are greater.Beijing Believes COVID-19 Is a Biological Weapon\n",

      "A recurring theme among conspiracy theorists is that the elite are just waiting for the right moment to roll out their ‘mark of the beast’ technology to remotely identify and control every single human being on the planet, thus sealing their plans for a one world government. And with many people willing to do just about anything to get back to some sense of normalcy, those fears appear more justified with each passing day.In the Book of Revelation [13:16-17], there is a passage that has attracted the imagination of believers and disbelievers throughout the ages, and perhaps never more so than right now: “And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark…”Was John of Patmos history’s first conspiracy theorist, or are we merely indulging ourselves today with a case of self-fulfilling prophecy? Whatever the case may be, many people would probably have serious reservations about being branded with an ID code even if it had never been mentioned in Holy Scripture. But that certainly has not stopped Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who has been warning about a global pandemic for years, from pushing such controversial technologies on all of us.In September 2019, just three months before the coronavirus first appeared in China, ID2020, a San Francisco-based biometric company that counts Microsoft as one of its founding members, quietly announced it was undertaking a new project that involves the “exploration of multiple biometric identification technologies for infants” that is based on “infant immunization” and only uses the “most successful approaches”.For anyone who may be wondering what one of those “most successful approaches” might look like, consider the following top contender for the contract. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have developed what is essentially a hi-tech ‘tattoo’ that stores data in invisible dye under the skin. The ‘mark’ would be delivered together with a vaccine, most likely administered by Gavi, the global vaccine agency that also falls under the umbrella of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.“The researchers showed that their new dye, which consists of nanocrystals called quantum dots… emits near-infrared light that can be detected by a specially equipped smartphone,” MIT News reported.And if the reader scrolls to the very bottom of the article, he will find that this study was funded first and foremost by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n",
      "Today, with the global service economy shut down to prevent large groups of infectious humans from assembling, it is easier to imagine a day when people are required to have their infrared ID ‘tattoo’ scanned in order to be granted access to any number of public venues. And from there, it requires little stretch of the imagination to see this same tracking nanotechnology being applied broadly across the global economy, where it could be used to eliminate the use of dirty money. After all, if reusable bags are being outlawed over the coronavirus panic-demic, why should reusable cash get special treatment?Writing earlier this month in these pages, geopolitical analyst Pepe Escobar provided a compelling argument that the coronavirus, which is driving the world towards a New Great Depression, is “being used as cover for the advent of a new, digital financial system, complete with a forced vaccine cum nanochip creating a full, individual, digital identity.As one possible future scenario, Escobar imagined “clusters of smart cities linked by AI, with people monitored full time and duly micro-chipped doing what they need with a unified digital currency.Those fears took on greater significance when Bill Gates sat down over the weekend for a breathtaking interview with CBS This Morning. Gates told host Anthony Mason that mass gatherings might have to be prohibited in the age of coronavirus unless and until a wide scale vaccination program is enacted.\n",
      "“What does ‘opening up’ look like,” Gates asked rhetorically before essentially changing the entire social and cultural makeup of the United States in one fell swoop. “Which activities, like schools, have such benefit and can be done in a way that the risk of transmission is very low, and which activities, like mass gatherings, maybe, in a certain sense more optional. And so until you’re widely vaccinated those [activities] may not come back at all” [The interview can be watched in its entirety here.According to Gates, anything that could be defined as a “mass gathering” – from spectators packed into a stadium for a sporting event, to protesters out on the street in demonstration – would be considered an act of civil disobedience without a vaccine. Little surprise that Gates chose the concept of “mass gathering” to snag all of us, for what is modern democratic society if not one big mass event after another? Indeed, since nobody will want to miss the next big happening, like the Super Bowl, or Comic-Con, or, heaven forbid, Eurovision, millions of people would predictably line up for miles to get their Microsoft-supported inoculation, even if it contains tracking technologies.All of this seems like sheer madness when it is remembered that there are other options for defeating the coronavirus than a mandatory global vaccine regime.Just last month, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director, told a Senate Subcommittee that over 80 percent of the people who get infected by the coronavirus “spontaneously recover” without any medical intervention. This makes one wonder why the global lockdown was designed for everyone instead of just the sick and elderly. Meanwhile, the drug hydroxychloroquine, which has been downplayed in the media despite being named as the most effective coronavirus treatment among physicians in a major survey, is starting to get a fresh look.Just this week, following Nevada’s lead, Michigan just reversed course and is now the second democratic state to request the anti-malarial drug from the Trump administration.So now it looks as though we are off to the races to see what will become the approved method of fighting the global pandemic – a hastily developed vaccine that may actually worsen the effects of the disease in those who contract it, or the already proven inexpensive drug hydroxychloroquine.\n",
      "If the winner turns out to be a global vaccine, possibly one that carries ID nanotechnology, don’t expect the wealthy to be lining up with their kids to be the first to get it. In 2015, The American Journal of Public Heath surveyed some 6200 schools in California – the epicenter of biometric ID research – and found vaccine exemptions were twice as common among kindergartners enrolled in private institutions.\n",
      "It seems that the elite are betting heavily on the development of an ID-tracking vaccine that would bring all races and institutions together under one big happy roof, but clearly they will continue living in their own fenced-off neighborhood in this one world government. Whether or not they will get a ‘special pass’ from receiving the new-age mark is another question.Bill Gates Crosses the Digital Rubicon, Says ‘Mass Gatherings’ May Not Return Without Global Vaccine\n",

      "Back in 2015 the NIH under the direction of Dr. Tony Fauci gave a $3.7 million grant to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.The Wuhan Institute of Virology is now the main suspect in leaking the coronavirus that has killed more than 50000 Americans and, thanks to Dr. Fauci again, destroyed the US economy.As early as 2018 US State Department officials warned about safety risks at the Wuhan Institute of Virology lab on scientists conducting risky tests with the bat coronavirus.US officials made several trips to the Wuhan laboratory.Despite the warnings, the US National Institute of Health (NIH) awarded a $3.7 million grant to the Wuhan lab studying the bat virus.  This was after State Department warned about the risky tests going on in the lab.The deadly China coronavirus that started in China sometime in late 2019 has now circled the globe.  Evidence suggests that the coronavirus didn’t come naturally.  We still don’t know whether the deadly virus was leaked intentionally or if it was an accident. But we do know that the Chinese did attempt to market a cure for the coronavirus to the world in January after the virus began to spread.According to the report from Wuhan the coronavirus came from either the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention or Wuhan Institute of Virology in Wuhan, China. These reports linking bats to the coronavirus started making the rounds back in January. A research paper published in the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control and Prevention determined the source of the coronavirus is a laboratory near the Seafood Market in Wuhan.On Sunday Rudy Giuliani dropped a bomb on Dr. Fauci. Rudy scolded the NIAID Director of granting $3.7 million to the Wuhan lab that leaked the coronavirus. And then Rudy accused the NIH of knowing more about this than they are leading on to.Rudy Giuliani questioned Dr. Anthony Fauci’s involvement in grants from the United States to a laboratory in Wuhan, China, that has been tied to the coronavirus pandemic.According to a report, the U.S. Intelligence Community has growing confidence that the current coronavirus strain may have accidentally escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology rather than from a wildlife market, as the Chinese Communist Party first claimed. During a Sunday interview on The Cats Roundtable, Giuliani questioned why the U.S. gave money to the lab.“Back in 2014, the Obama administration prohibited the U.S. from giving money to any laboratory, including in the U.S., that was fooling around with these viruses. Prohibited! Despite that, Dr. Fauci gave $3.7 million to the Wuhan laboratory — even after the State Department issued reports about how unsafe that laboratory was, and how suspicious they were in the way they were developing a virus that could be transmitted to humans,” he claimed.Rudy Giuliani later dropped this bomb on the grant to the Wuhan lab — Did Obama sign off on this?Rudy Giuliani Hint Possible Investigation Into Obama Approval of $3.7 Million NIH Grant to Wuhan Lab in 2015\n",

      "The coronavirus is making headlines, the lies are multiplying, the rejection of the Chinese is increasing and China denounces the United States for causing global panic.Since January 31, the same topic has been spoken in all corners of the world: coronavirus, a virulent virus that was unleashed in an animal market in the city of Wuhan, in central China, which has expanded by different countries in Europe, Asia and America, and which has so far claimed the lives of hundreds of people.The number of people infected with the coronavirus is not the only thing that has been increasing, also the lies and the xenophobic wave against the Chinese or against anyone with Asian features. There have been so many discriminatory episodes around the world that there is already talk of \"chinophobia\" and Chinese citizens themselves have launched a campaign on social networks titled \"I am not a virus\".Lies have prevailed and have left no room for truth. An example of this has been the video that went viral on social networks where a young woman is seen taking bat soup.These images unleashed a wave of accusations against the Chinese for allegedly causing this epidemic and putting the health of the world population at risk for having strange and bad health and eating habits.What did not go viral was the statement from the protagonist of that video, influencer Wang Mengyum, who clarified that this video had been recorded 3 years ago in Palau, that is, outside of China, and in a restaurant. He also pointed out that the bat soup was not eaten in an open-air market like Wuhan's, but in a restaurant. And it is that the ingestion of strange animals is more a custom of the tourist who visits Asia than of its own inhabitants.A bat. Chinese blogger apologizes for eating and encouraging bat consumption.Added to the terror of social networks was the decision of the US government to prohibit the entry of any citizen who has passed through China during the past two weeks.China immediately responded and denounced that the United States \" is creating panic among the world population instead of offering aid\" and that this decision \"contravenes the recommendations of the World Health Organization, which insisted on not imposing restrictions on movement.\" But what interest would the United States have in causing a global panic? At the moment, no one knows. What is certain is that thanks to this virus, the Donald Trump government could stop the Asian giant due to the important influence it has on the international board, for its technological development and the growth of its military capacity.\n",
      "The escalation of tensions. Trade war: The first major blow of the Trump administration against the Chinese economy was in March 2018, when the application of million-dollar tariffs to Chinese products that entered its territory began. Trump justified this move because of Beijing's alleged \"unfair business practices\". President Xi JinPing was quick to respond and took similar steps with American products, sparking what some analysts called a \"trade war.\"\n",
      "Blockade of Huawei: In May 2019, the US prohibited American companies from negotiating and providing technology to Huawei, China's leading telecommunications company. For this reason, the new Huawei phones could not use applications such as Gmail, Play Store, Google maps, among others. And it was not the first blow against the Chinese technological giant. Just 5 months earlier, the US had ordered Canada to arrest the vice president of Huawei, who is the daughter of the creator of this company, for the alleged violation of US sanctions against Iran.\n",
      "Hong Kong protests : On March 15, 2019, thousands of protesters in Hong Kong take to the streets to demand an extradition bill from China. Although the bill was withdrawn, the pressure from the street rose more and more, to claim its independence, its separation from China. Xi Jinping's government accused the USand other foreign powers to foment the demonstrations. The US government never hid its position. In late November, President Trump enacted the \"Human Rights and Democracy Law\" in support of protesters protesting for democracy in Hong Kong, protesters who were portrayed as peaceful, but who also caused serious assaults. against people who did not support their cause. The Chinese Foreign Ministry denounced that the Trump law in support of the protesters is \"extremely abominable and harbors absolutely sinister intentions.\"5G and Siberia Power : As relations with the US were increasingly strained, China moved its chips. On October 31, it launches the 5G system, surpassing the United States, and a few days later it inaugurates a mega-gas pipeline with Russia that will allow supplying this fossil fuel to northern China from Siberia. In addition, it will get Russia to circumvent the sanctions that the US imposed on Europe and place its main export resource on the Asian giant.\n",
      "NATO: The response was immediate. The United States and the member countries of the North Atlantic Alliance took advantage of the organization's 70th anniversary meeting to put China in their sights and label it as a challenge that they had to face as an Alliance.\n",
      "Neither with the tariff, commercial nor technological war did the US manage to destroy the Asian giant. Curiously, it was a virus that achieved the greatest desire of the United States: to isolate China . Inevitable not to remember the years in which the United States inoculated venereal diseases against 696 Guatemalans during 1946 and 1948, or as when the CIA deployed Operation Mongoose against Cuba to introduce various types of viruses in its sugarcane areas, tobacco fields and pig farms.

      "The COVID-2019 epidemic, which began in the Chinese city of Wuhan, managed to get out of China and spread throughout the world in two months. In mid-March, an article became popular in social networks according to which a dangerous strain was artificially created as part of a study of bat coronavirus by American scientists. The scientific work was written by a team of biologists back in 2015, on November 9 of the same year it was published on the scientific portal Nature.  Researchers studied the SHCo14 virus found in Chinese horseshoe bats. Scientists combined this strain with another - its name is SARS, and it causes a severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. Further, the researchers “generated and characterized a chimeric virus that can <...> multiply in the primary cells of the human respiratory tract.\" In other words, biologists altered the coronavirus of bats so much that they got a strain that could infect a person - and the virus would cause severe pneumonia in him. Among the authors of the article are listed as researchers at the University of North Carolina, USA, and the Wuhan Virology Institute, China. In 2020, users of social networks read the old scientific material and they had suspicions about who is behind the COVID-2019 epidemic. If some people, having read the article, decided to share with subscribers the very fact of its existence, then others are already building theories. They are sure: the coronavirus epidemic is the work of the US government, and one of the goals of this diversion was to strike at its own citizens. On Russian-language Twitter, they also looked at the results of a study by scientists. Willy Wilmer, a German lawyer and politician, really believes that the coronavirus was brought to China by infected American soldiers who arrived in the country for sporting events. People agree with his version, and are ready to blame the United States for thousands of deaths. Some users are sure that there are only two countries that will repel the United States in the situation with coronavirus, although they do not yet say how they will do it. And someone was not at all surprised that the United States was considered the culprit of the pandemic. The comments did not answer the question, however, a military event was indeed held in China. The World War Games were held in Wuhan at the end of October 2019, probably Willy Wimmer referred to them. At least, a former member of the UN Commission on Biological and Chemical Weapons, Igor Nikulin,  interpreted the assumption of the German politician exactly and completely agree with him. Both politicians came to such conclusions not without reason. These thoughts were prompted by the representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China Zhao Lijian, who also believes that COVID-2019 was brought into his country by the US military. Users who commented on a post about Willy Wimmer’s words and laboratory research in North Carolina 2015, are sure that Americans are really to blame for everything - and only because of their attitude to the rest of the world. But it was not difficult for other users to guess which television channel most commentators prefer to watch. And another commentator suggested that the reason for such hatred of people towards the USA is the refusal of medicines. Another commentator, who learned about the experiments in the laboratory of North Carolina, easily believed in the guilt of the States and even suggested what to do with this country. The news that the coronavirus reached the United States, this person is very happy. But there is an assumption that the United States came up with a coronavirus not only for China, but also for other countries. For each nationality - its own separate strain. In fact, while the virus, supposedly created in 2015, is being discussed only by politicians and scientists far from laboratories. Until now, specialists in the region have not published the results of comparisons of strains. Even before people learned about research in the North Carolina laboratory, they were building theories about where the coronavirus came from, and there was nothing to do with natural causes. In their research, the main suspects were God, Putin and the Marxist revolutionaries. There are other considerations in this regard. Before the coronavirus spread around the world and caused a pandemic, users of social networks began to speculate about who was behind it. Bill Gates and his wife came under fire from conspiracy theorists. People learned about the coronavirus created in the US laboratory in 2015. They decided: a pandemic is no coincidence\n",

      " Is 5G to partially blame for coronavirus deaths? Can 5G cause the blood that’s circulating in your body to be unable to carry oxygen?What’s especially horrifying about the critical care of coronavirus patients is that they aren’t suffering from “viral pneumonia,” but rather from an inability to absorb or carry oxygen in the blood.This has been confirmed by NYC ICU emergency physician Cameron Kyle-Sidell, who has released several videos detailing how coronavirus is not a kind of viral pneumonia. “We’re treating the wrong disease,” he says. And the ventilators are damaging the lungs of patients. He explains:COVID-19 lung disease, as far as I can see, is not a pneumonia and should not be treated as one. Rather, it appears as if some kind of viral-induced disease most resembling high altitude sickness. Is it as if tens of thousands of my fellow New Yorkers are on a plane at 30000 feet at the cabin pressure is slowly being let out. These patients are slowly being starved of oxygen.Watch him explain how coronavirus patients are dying from oxygen starvation, not from a viral pneumonia lung infection:What this emergency room physician makes clear is that coronavirus patients are dying from oxygen deprivation, not a classic scenario of viral pneumonia. The patients’ lungs work fine, in other words, and the ventilators are actually damaging their lungs by forcing excessive pressure into them.How does blood transport oxygen in the first place?How, exactly, can all these patients be starved of oxygen when their lungs are technically working just fine? To understand one possible answer, you have to first understand how the blood carries oxygen. It’s way more fascinating than you might have supposed.When functioning normally, 1 molecule of hemoglobin binds with 4 molecules of oxygen, using iron (Fe2+), forming oxyhemoglobin. But this binding is only achieved because of something called “partial pressure” which means the concentration of oxygen in the lung tissues is higher than the concentration of oxygen on the hemoglobin molecule (roughly stated, this is simplified somewhat), so the oxygen “leaps” to the hemoglobin in order to equalize the partial pressures across the chasm.But 5G radiation alters the porosity of cell membranes, allowing some molecules or ionic elements to move more easily across those members, displacing other molecules (or soluble gasses such as carbon dioxide) that might normally make that leap. For example, it is well documented that 5G radiation causes “Voltage Gated Ion Channels” (VGIC), specifically with calcium ions (VGCC), causing cellular toxicity due to too much calcium entering the cell walls and poisoning the cells.The research on this was published in Environmental Research — here’s the link — and reveals that 5G exposure not only alters cell permeability (porosity), but also releases peroxinitrites in the body. These are inflammation-producing molecules that ravage other healthy molecules circulating in the blood.A thorough review of the available published science on wireless (WiFi) and electromagnetic frequency (EMF) exposure has identified at least seven different ways that WiFi and EMF microwave pollution actively harms the human body.Published in the journal Environmental Research, the peer-reviewed paper explains that exposure to WiFi signals, which are everywhere these days, can lead to: oxidative stress, sperm and testicular damage, neuropsychiatric effects including EEG (electroencephalogram) changes, apoptosis (programmed cell death), cellular DNA damage, endocrine changes, and calcium overload.Note that coronavirus patients are already being observed with neuropsychiatric effects, testicular damage and oxidative stress, three of the symptoms of 5G exposure.We just created this simple chart to point out the similarities between 5G exposure and coronavirus symptoms. Feel free to share everywhere, and link back to this article if possible:Mass insanity due to psychiatric effects of cellular poisoning. We also know that 5G radiation and its effects on the cells of the body can lead to symptoms of insanity, hallucinations and even powerful personality changes. Interestingly, CNN’s Chris Cuomo already described bouts of hallucinations as he was battling the coronavirus, living in a high-5G city (NYC). As I wrote on Natural News last December:5G radiation causes “neuropsychiatric” effects through a mechanism described as ion potentiation poisoning of brain cells, according to research published in Environmental Research.This results in behavioral changes and even personality changes among those who are routinely exposed, researchers found. In other words, 5G is a weapon system that doubles as a telecommunications infrastructure, but the real impact is to damage human brain function and destroy rationality, reason and civility, especially among those who live in high population cities where 5G towers are becoming ubiquitous. That’s why you may have noticed increased insanity and widespread mental derangement in those areas.Part of this effect may also be due to the production of peroxynitrites, which are generated in the body’s cells upon exposure to the voltage emitted by 5G radiation, which is beamed at your body in a narrow cone of high-intensity energy. (5G antennae focus energy in a tight beam that follows you around.) We are already observing the coronavirus causing psychiatric effects, including zombie-like violent, aggressive behavior such as deliberately spitting and coughing on people.How 5G radiation exposure alters the ability of red blood cells to carry oxygen. Getting back to the oxygen question, the answer to why 5G radiation exposure may alter the function of hemoglobin is found in understanding the protein structure of hemoglobin itself.Hemoglobin relies on something called the “heme group” which is a complex molecule with iron (FE 2+) in its center. This is surrounded by something called a “porphyrin ring” which is a cluster of unique structures (made of oxygen, carbon and hydrogen) that has a special affinity for other oxygen atoms. The ability for oxygen to “leap” onto this molecule in the lungs depends entirely on the structure (which also implies the ionic charges) of these complex molecules.One thing to note in all this is that without the presence of histidine, a special protein, this heme group would have higher affinity toward carbon monoxide than oxygen, meaning the entire heme group would be occupied by carbon monoxide, blocking the absorption of oxygen. Thus, the histidine presence is critical for allowing the heme group to bind with oxygen. If you mess with histidine, you end up forcing hemoglobin to carry CO instead of O2, effectively creating oxygen deprivation in the blood.This heme group, by the way, has special affinity for carbon dioxide, which allows the same molecule to carry CO2 out of the body’s cells and transport CO2 back to the lungs. Remember: The same hemoglobin molecule must carry both CO2 and O2 but at different times, and it must attract and then release those molecules at opposite times in order to rid the body of CO2 and nourish the body with O2. This is all accomplished with a delicate balance of proteins and protein folding.The hemoglobin molecule itself is a miracle of nanotechnology. It transmorphs into two different structural states based on whether it’s carrying oxygen or not. In what’s called the “R-state,” this molecule is like a magnet for oxygen. When four oxygen atoms are bound, it becomes a highly stable structure (and appears red). Technically, the binding of a single molecule of oxygen (O2) increases the affinity toward oxygen on the three other oxygen sites, making the hemoglobin “mop up” four oxygen molecules very quickly. When it lacks oxygen, it changes to a “T-state” and appears blue, which is why low-oxygen blood has a blue color.The important thing to understand in all this is that any alteration of the delicate structure of hemoglobin will impair its ability to bind with oxygen.Take a look at the hemoglobin molecule representation above, from APSUbiology.org, and note the heme groups which are positioned in four places across the molecule. The polypeptide chains are part of the transmorphing structure of the molecule that allows it to carry and release both CO2 and O2, depending on the partial pressures of the gasses at different locations in the body (lungs vs. other cells). Note carefully that any change in the structure of hemoglobin will cause it to stop functioning:Increasing the permeability of the hemoglobin molecule — i.e. its affinity toward other soluble gasses such as carbon dioxide — will “occupy” the hemoglobin molecule with the wrong substances, making it unable to absorb oxygen because it is not presenting in its “R-state” by the time the heart pumps the blood back to the lungs.Stated another way, anything that significantly alters the affinity of hemoglobin toward other soluble gasses (carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, or even ionic minerals in the blood) could “shut off” the ability of blood to carry oxygen by altering its atomic structure.If you change the structure of the heme group, it no longer functions to transport oxygen. Because in the case of the heme group, the structure is the function. Perhaps this can only be appreciated by organic chemists, but this heme group is truly a miracle of nanotechnology.Here’s a diagram of how iron, histidine, the heme group and O2 oxygen molecules interact with hemoglobin, which alters its structure depending on the “oxygenated” vs. “deoxygenated” forms. Can 5G exposure alter the structure of hemoglobin by increasing its affinity toward other molecules which are not O2?\n",
      "The real question in all this is best phrased as I have asked it above. I doubt that we are dealing with a phenomenon where 5G radiation exposures blocks the ability of hemoglobin to carry oxygen, but rather occupies the hemoglobin molecule with other elements that alter its structure and therefore its function, inhibiting its ability to bind with oxygen.This is very likely happening all across the world wherever 5G is currently functioning, it’s just that the coronavirus is now exacerbating the symptoms and conditions to the point where mass death is occurring.In other words, the coronavirus pandemic would likely not be nearly as bad if 5G exposure / radiation pollution wasn’t already compromising the structure and function of hemoglobin cells in the bodies of people who live in 5G cities.This doesn’t mean the coronavirus isn’t real, of course; just that these two attacks on the human body have a synergistic effect of toxicity and mortality.Conclusion: Humanity is committing suicide with 5G.While I strongly disagree with those who are claiming there’s no such thing as a virus or that the coronavirus is a hoax, I do agree that the widespread deployment of 5G antennas is a kind of suicide pact for the world.Just as the Romans built their aqueducts out of lead linings and thereby poisoned their own citizens, driving them insane with load poisoning, the modern world of Big Tech and telecommunications is mass poisoning humanity with electropollution.Right now, a lot of people are talking about the book, “The Invisible Rainbow” by John Kaminski, who believes coronavirus is an “electrical disease” and that 5G alone is causing all the mass deaths, not the virus. He writes things like, “The flu is not contagious” and “the quarantine is all a terrible hoax.”Surely he is wrong on those claims, but he may not be wrong at all about the toxicity of electropollution and how 5G is actually a kind of “suicide system” that’s destroying humanity.\n",
      "This all deserves a tremendous amount of additional study, but because we live in a world where Big Tech controls all the narratives and censors all those who question the safety of 5G, it now seems impossible for humanity to extricate itself from this mass suicide mission that has already been unleashed.\n",
      "And that doesn’t even cover the topic of vaccines. What if Bill Gates’ vaccines are being deliberately engineered to contain toxic substances that 5G exposure will push into the cells, causing widespread death from “binary” exposure and subsequent cell toxicity?It sure would be a simple way for Bill Gates to achieve his global depopulation dreams, all while administering a global IQ test that finds out which people are stupid enough to line up and be injected with a euthanasia weapon system.Watch my video here on how we can end this pandemic and end the lockdowns, too, by turning to nutrition and masks:Can 5G exposure alter the structure and function of hemoglobin, causing coronavirus patients to die from oxygen deprivation?\n",

      "In earlier articles I related the opinions of biochemists and bio-warfare specialists on the circumstances justifying suspicion of a virus being created in a lab and deliberately released in a foreign country as a means of either low- or high-intensity warfare, or as merely a means of destabilising a nation and perhaps severely damaging its economy, with the loss of life being an added plus. The US is the country that appears most devoted to biological warfare, though a number of other nations are eager participants, including the UK and Israel.I would remind readers here of the statement from PNAC, in a report titled, “Rebuilding America’s Defenses”, that “Advanced forms of biological warfare that can ‘target’ specific genotypes may transform biological warfare … to a politically useful tool.”\n",
      "This subject is difficult to discuss openly in a nation of people, or even within international bodies like the UN. The infliction of such a pathogen onto a nation is clearly an act of war. However, if the leaders have not irrefutable proof of a bio-weapon and its source, and are not prepared for a military response, the only solution is to remain silent and emphasise research on defensive measures in the event of a recurrence. Even with overwhelming circumstantial evidence, a public statement or an accusation would likely be derided as yet another unfounded conspiracy theory. This is essentially the same with disclosure to the UN General Assembly or other such body; an accusation lacking conclusive proof would merely be derided and embarrassing.This is similarly true with destabilization and violence, as China has very recently experienced in Hong Kong (and which has not yet stabilized), and the violence in Tibet and Xinjiang. The American ‘black  hand’ (from the American consulate) was caught red-handed in Hong Kong and sources of funding the HK terrorists are now being identified. There is no dispute anywhere that the violence and terrorism in both Tibet and Xinjiang were American-inspired and funded, but absolute irrefutable proof is lacking. All of these are clearly acts of war but, lacking final proof, responses are limited to defensive measures.In a previous article on China’s new coronavirus, I referred to a thesis on Biological Weapons by Leonard Horowitz and Zygmunt Dembek who stated that clear signs of a genetically-engineered bio-warfare agent were (a) a disease caused by an uncommon (unusual, rare, or unique) agent, with (b) lack of an epidemiological explanation, i.e. no clear idea of source; (c) An “unusual manifestation and/or geographic distribution”, such as race-specificity; and (d) multiple sources of infection.China’s coronavirus appears to satisfy all four criteria. This is especially true since it appears that only one Caucasian (and some Japanese) has been infected to date, with the virus so far appearing to be tightly focused to Chinese.Also the statement by Dr. Leonard Horowitz who quoted one military expert as saying “Even if you suspect biological terrorism, it’s hard to prove. It’s equally hard to disprove . . . You can trace an arms shipment, but it’s almost impossible to trace the origins of a virus that comes from a bug.” Another expert stated  that a properly-done release of an infectious agent cannot be traced to its source and might be considered an “act of God”.In 2003, many Russian medical experts voiced the opinion that the SARS virus was most likely man-made and deliberately released as a weapon. Sergei Kolesnikov, a member of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, said the propagation of the SARS virus might well have been caused by leaking a combat virus grown in bacteriological weapons labs because the natural compound [of contained virus genome sections] was impossible, that the mix could never appear in nature, but could be done only in a laboratory.At the same time, Nikolai Filatov, the head of Moscow’s epidemiological services, stated he believed SARS was man-made because “there is no vaccine for this virus, its make-up is unclear, it has not been very widespread and the population is not immune to it.\"\n",
      "It appears the Russians may be arriving at the same conclusion for China’s new virus in 2020. The text below consists of a condensed version of an interview conducted by the Russian news portal mk.ru, on January 27, 2020, with Igor Nikulin, a former member of the UN Commission on Biological and Chemical Weapons (1998-2003).The article begins by noting that the prevalence of the coronavirus in China is increasing, while Beijing takes extraordinary measures to reduce the impact of this disaster. It further states that a number of experts “note strange coincidences in the circumstances” of the emergence of this new infection and are reluctant to exclude an “artificial origin”. Mr. Nikulin was asked to comment on the situation.Russian Expert: “We Cannot Rule Out Man Made Origin of these Infections”\n",
      "Interviewer: in recent years dangerous for humans coronaviruses appear more and more often. What does this have to do with anything?Nikulin: With these coronaviruses, the situation is really very strange. Until 2000, none of them “jumped on a person.” They have been living next to humans for millions of years, but always only on some animals parasitized. For example, on camels, as in the case of [MERS]. Or on bats, birds, anyone, but this infection did not pass on to a person. And there are already 8 deadly viruses in 20 years. It’s obviously too much.Interviewer: So we can’t rule out the man-made origin of these infections?Nikulin: If it was the first outbreak, you’d think it was a natural mutation. But it is hardly natural, because every few years such incidents are repeated. It’s atypical pneumonia, it’s avian flu, it’s swine flu, it’s something else.Interviewer: Some experts note that the time of the outbreak in China seems to be chosen specifically to cause maximum harm. Just on the eve of the New Year on the Eastern calendar, when in China mass internal migration for the holidays, as well as events with the participation of a large number of people. And the place seemed to be specially selected. Historically and geographically, all roads in China lead to Wuhan. It is the largest transport hub, the largest international airport. Through it [planes] fly to the States, Australia, Japan, the Middle East, Paris, London, Moscow. Besides these coincidences, what can prove the artificial origin of the virus?”Nikulin: Just deciphering the genome. Its results may show if it is a virus of natural origin, or laboratory, when some recombinant “piece” is inserted into the gene . . . there are modern computer programs that allow you to read all this, decipher and compare with the samples available in databases.\n",
      "Interviewer: Is it possible that the new coronavirus only affects people of Chinese nationality? So it’s set on certain features of the human gene?\n",
      "Nikulin: If it turns out that this is indeed the case, then such a natural mutation cannot be accurate. It’s mathematical proof that it’s an artificially created virus.\n",
      "Interviewer: In which labs can it appear?Nikulin: I can only assume. But look: China, like Russia, is surrounded by American research biolaboratories. They are in different countries along the perimeter of China’s borders – in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Taiwan, Philippines, South Korea, Japan. They were in Indonesia, but they closed them. And wherever there are these American biolaboratories, or near them, there are outbreaks of new diseases, often unknown. Threats to the local population are simply ignored by Americans. The main thing is that it was away from the territory of the United States.Interviewer: How many foreign biolaboratories do the U.S. have?Nikulin: It’s 400.Interviewer: They are overseen by the Pentagon?Nikulin: Of course. It’s all funded from the Pentagon budget. Therefore, it is not necessary to say that peaceful humanitarian research is being carried out there. Do you think the Pentagon’s money is being spent on peaceful research? No one is allowed in. These are military labs. When more than a hundred people died in Georgia near such a laboratory within one month, do you think someone was allowed to go there? No one was allowed into the American laboratory at all.\n",
      "Those countries that consider themselves victims of bioterrorism should investigate all these cases and bring them up for international discussion. For example, to the UN Security Council. To raise the issue of the activities of American biolaboratories outside the United States. We have to do something. Because a lot of people are already suffering from it. And in general, it is necessary to strengthen the biosecurity of the country.China’s Coronavirus. “We Cannot Rule Out Man Made Origin of these Infections”\n",

      "Believe it or not, a coronavirus strain is a patented by the The Pirbright Institute, which is partially funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Another strain, which was isolated from humans, is owned by the CDC. The patent page for coronavirus explains that it “may be used as a vaccine for treating and/or preventing a disease, such as infectious bronchitis, in a subject,” suggesting that this is just another weaponized viral strain designed to sell more useless, deadly vaccines, while at the same time killing off a few thousand, or perhaps a few million, people. A close look at the patent page also shows that the Pirbright Institute owns all sorts of other virus patents, including one for African swine fever virus, which is listed as a “vaccine.” t is thus no surprise that Bill Gates is a Pirbright Institute financial backer, seeing as how he’s one of the most aggressive, vaccine-pushing “philanthropists” on the planet. And here is another patent for Coronavirus, isolated from humans — Patent US7220852B1 – CORONAVIRUS a.k.a. SARS. The patent was granted to the CDC and the “inventors” are all American:You can download the above patent HERE. The way this whole coronavirus situation is taking shape would seem to be exactly what Gates once proposed as a “solution” to the alleged problem of “overpopulation.” At an infamous TED Talk, Gates explained that vaccines are one of the keys to reducing global population levels, and what better way to do that than to unleash patented coronavirus on the masses in order to later introduce a patented vaccine for it? Bill And Melinda Gates Hosted “Event 201” Back In October, Described As A “High-Level Pandemic Exercise”. What’s further interesting is that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation co-hosted a “high-level pandemic exercise” back in October that involved discussions about how “public / private partnerships will be necessary during the response to a severe pandemic in order to diminish large-scale economic and societal consequences.” Held in partnership with the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and the World Economic Forum, this latest endeavor by Bill Gates is highly suspicious, to say the least, especially when considering that it was held just in time for the coronavirus outbreak. As is usually the case with suspicious disease outbreaks that get the media and academia talking about new vaccines and public-private partnerships, Bill Gates’ fingerprints are almost always hiding in the background. And this is exactly the case with coronaviruses, which could accomplish many of Gates’ expectations for the future, including mass depopulation, mass vaccination and mass consolidation of government power. “These events are increasing, and they are disruptive to health, economies, and society,” reads an announcement about “Event 201,” as they called it, or the meeting with Gates and his cronies from back in October. Managing these events already strains global capacity, even absent a pandemic threat. Experts agree that it is only a matter of time before one of these pandemics becomes global – a pandemic with potentially catastrophic consequences. A severe pandemic, which becomes ‘Event 201,’ would require reliable cooperation among several industries, national governments, and key international institutions.” This reads like a predictive script for what we’re now seeing with coronavirus, as governments around the world scramble to “manage” this deadly outbreak with martial law, vaccine fast-tracking, quarantines and plenty of fear-mongering. “If we do a really great job on vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower [the global population] by perhaps about 10 to 15 percent,” Gates is infamously quoted as saying about the true intent of his “humanitarian” efforts.Bill Gates Funded The PIRBRIGHT Institute, Which Owns A Patent On Coronavirus; The CDC Owns The Strain Isolated From Humans\n",

      "Bill Gates hosted a closed-door meeting for global elites and the invitation came with a COVID-19 coronavirus plush toy, a few months later thousands would be dead. Welcome to the New World Order.What I am about to show you is so unbelievable, so infused with conspiracy theory , that your mind will immediately reject it. Yet, the information is 100% true and taken from Johns Hopkins own website. Let me take you back to the evening of October 18, 2019, to a gathering entitled ‘Event 201’, something Johns Hopkins calls a ‘global pandemic exercise’. Of course, it was invitation only, and held behind closed doors. The financing for this event came from none other than the Bill Gates Foundation.To everyone who attended, they were given a cute and cuddly COVID-19 plush toy, the very one you see in the photo at the top of this article. Can you imagine what kind of sick-minded marketing people could conceive of a coronavirus stuffed animal? Wake up, people, the New World Order is not playing around, and yes, they have no qualms of any kind about creating a plush toy out of a killer virus that to date has infected 181377 people, and has killed 7118 people, and they best part? They proudly display these statistics on the official Johns Hopkins website, click here to see it for yourself. I wonder if they have any of those cute and cuddly coronavirus plushies left?The fact that Bill Gates was a host of this event surprises no one who is a regular reader of NTEB, no sir. Take a look:In 1999, Gates gave over 20 million dollars to Johns Hopkins to establish a wing of the hospital where the Foundation was born. This foundation has always hidden behind the mantra of “Health and help” for women in third world countries. The thrust of the foundation has been working with the big Pharma companies, to create vaccines for the masses in these impoverished countries.For years we’ve been watching as Microsoft founder Bill Gates, now retired from the company he founded, use his billions to give ‘free vaccinations‘ to people in third world countries. Now Bill has become a founding partner in another company, this one is called the ID2020 Alliance, and its goal is to give every human being on Earth a digital id. How do they plan on accomplishing this feat? By combining mandatory vaccinations with implantable microchips. Genius, isn’t it? And coming soon to a theater near you, as the saying goes.The participants of Event 201, invited there by the rich and powerful elites that rule the world, sat and war-gamed how an outbreak of COVID-19 coronavirus might go. Looks like the meeting was a success because just one month to the day later, the first case of COVID-19 was reported in China, and well, you know the rest.\n",

The exercise illustrated areas where public/private partnerships will be necessary during the response to a severe pandemic in order to diminish large-scale economic and societal consequences.Official Statement of Denial About nCoV and Our Pandemic Exercise. In recent years, the world has seen a growing number of epidemic events, amounting to approximately 200 events annually. These events are increasing, and they are disruptive to health, economies, and society. Managing these events already strains global capacity, even absent a pandemic threat. Experts agree that it is only a matter of time before one of these epidemics becomes global—a pandemic with potentially catastrophic consequences.

      "No matter which hospital a coronavirus patient may seek help from, the question is, Will they be able to leave walking out the front door, or end up being wheeled out the basement backdoor? Prompt administration of intravenous vitamin C, in high doses, can make the difference.Abundant clinical evidence confirms vitamin C's effectiveness when used in sufficient quantity.Physicians have demonstrated the powerful antiviral action of vitamin C for decades.Specific instructions for intravenous vitamin C.The Japanese College of Intravenous Therapy (JCIT) recommends intravenous vitamin C (IVC) 12.5/25g (12500 - 25000 mg) for acute viral infections (influenza, herpes zoster, common cold, rubella, mumps, etc.) and virus mimetic infections (idiopathic sudden hearing loss, Bell's palsy). In adults, IVC 12.5g is given for early stage illness with mild symptoms, and IVC 25g for moderate to severe symptoms. IVC is usually administered once or twice a day for 2-5 continuous days, along with or without general treatments for viral infections.Patients with acute viral infections show a depletion of vitamin C and increasing free radicals and cellular dysfunction. Such patients should be treated with vitamin C, oral or IV, for neutralizing free radicals throughout the body and inside cells, maintaining physiological functions, and enhancing natural healing. If patients progress to sepsis, vitamin C should be added intravenously as soon as possible along with conventional therapy for sepsis.Toronto Star, 30 May 2003: \"Fred Hui, MD believes that administering vitamin C intravenously is a treatment worth trying. And he'd like to see people admitted to hospital for the pneumonia-like virus treated with the vitamin intravenously while also receiving the usual drugs for SARS. 'I appeal to hospitals to try this for people who already have SARS,' says Hui. Members of the public would also do well to build up their levels of vitamin C, he says, adding that there is nothing to lose in trying it. 'This is one of the most harmless substances there is,' Hui states. 'There used to be concern about kidney stones, but that was theoretical. It was never borne out in an actual case.' Hui says he has found intravenous vitamin C effective in his medical practice with patients who have viral illnesses.\"Additional administration details are readily obtained from a free download of the complete Riordan Clinic Intravenous Vitamin C Protocol. [4] Although initially prepared for cancer patients, the protocol has found widespread application for many other diseases, particularly viral illnesses.\"Research and experience has shown that a therapeutic goal of reaching a peak-plasma concentration of ~20 mM (350- 400 mg/dL) is most efficacious. (No increased toxicity for posoxidant IVC plasma vitamin C levels up to 780 mg/dL has been observed.) . . . [T]he administering physician begins with a series of three consecutive IVC infusions at the 15, 25, and 50 gram dosages followed by post IVC plasma vitamin C levels in order to determine the oxidative burden for that patient so that subsequent IVCs can be optimally dosed.\"Given the rapid rate of success of intravenous vitamin C in viral diseases, I strongly believe it would be my first recommendation in the management of corona virus infections. It is of great importance for all doctors to be informed about intravenous vitamin C. When a patient is already in hospital severely ill, this would be the best solution to help save her or his life. Winning the hospital game. When faced with hospitalization, the most powerful person in the most entire hospital system is the patient. However, in most cases, the system works on the assumption that the patient will not claim that power. If on your way in you signed the hospital's legal consent form, you can unsign it. You can revoke your permission. Just because somebody has permission to do one thing doesn't mean that they have the permission to do everything. There's no such thing as a situation that you cannot reverse. You can change your mind about your own personal healthcare. It concerns your very life. The rights of the patient override the rules of any institution.If the patient doesn't know that, or if they're not conscious, or if they just don't have the moxie to do it, the next most powerful person is the spouse. The spouse has enormous influence and can do almost as much as the patient. If the patient is incapacitated, the spouse can, and must, do all the more. If there is no spouse present, the next most powerful people in the system are the children of the patient.When you go to the hospital, bring along a big red pen, and cross out anything that you don't like in the hospital's permission form. And before you sign it, add anything you want. Write out \"I want intravenous vitamin C, 25 grams per day, until I state otherwise.\" And should they say, \"We're not going to admit you,\" you reply, \"Please put it in writing that you refuse to admit me.\" What do you think their lawyers are going to do with that? They have to admit you. It's a game, and you can win it. But you can't win it if you don't know the rules. And basically, they don't tell you the rules.This is deadly serious. Medical mistakes are now the third leading cause of death in the US. Yes, medical errors kill over 400000 Americans every year. That's 1100 each day, every day.There are mistakes of commission and mistakes of omission. Failure to provide intravenous vitamin C is, literally, a grave omission. Do not allow yourself or your loved ones to be deprived of a simple, easy to prepare and administer IV of vitamin C.If a family member of mine died due to coronavirus infection, after a doctor refused to use intravenous vitamin C, I would challenge his or her treatment in a court of law. I would win.It can be done Vitamin IVs can be arranged in virtually any hospital, anywhere in the world. Attorney and cardiologist Thomas E. Levy's very relevant presentation is free access.Both the letter and the intent of new USA legislation now make this easier for you.The new federal Right to Try Act provides patients suffering from life-threatening diseases or conditions the right to use investigational drugs... It amends the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to exempt investigational drugs provided to patients who have exhausted approved treatment options and are unable to participate in a clinical trial involving the drug. Advocates of right to try laws have sought to accelerate access to new drugs for terminally ill patients who are running out of options. Arguably, the law does not represent a radical change in this and several other states, however, because in 2016, California had already joined the majority of other states in adopting a law enabling physicians to help terminally ill patients pursue investigational therapies, without fear of Medical Board or state civil or criminal liability. . . The new Right to Try law should give physicians, as well as drug manufacturers, some added comfort about FDA enforcement in these cases.\"Therefore, in regards to intravenous vitamin C, do not accept stories that \"the hospital can't\" or \"the doctor can't\" or that \"the state won't allow it. If you hear any of this malarkey, please send the Orthomolecular Medicine News Service the text of the policy or the law that says so. In the meantime, take the reins and get vitamin C in the veins.Hospital-based Intravenous Vitamin C Treatment for Coronavirus and Related Illnesses\n",

      "First of all, Wuhan is a place and not a race, and to identify the coronavirus by its place of origin, like naming the Ebola Virus for a river in Zaire, is not racist or xenophobic — it's merely accurate.  There is no racism or xenophobia in labeling an infection \"Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever\" or calling something \"Lyme Disease\" after a nearby town in Connecticut. What calling this latest virus the Wuhan Virus is is a reminder of the multiple contagions China has spawned and released on an unsuspecting world.  Nor is connecting some very big, ugly, and obvious dots just another conspiracy theory to be dismissed out of hand. From the beginning China has been less than forthcoming about this virus and resisted sharing critical data and access to WHO and CDC specialists.  And have we forgotten Dr. Li Wenliang, the 33-year-old ophthalmologist based in Wuhan, the epicenter of the contagion, who tried to tell the world that China was hiding something malevolent, only to be silenced and imprisoned by Chinese authorities for allegedly fabricating lies about the disease's deadly potential?  He would later die of the disease he tried to warn us about and the Chinese tried to keep under wraps: In an interview with the Communist Party–controlled Beijing Youth Daily newspaper in late January, Dr. Li recalled seeing reports in December of an unusual cluster of pneumonia cases linked to an animal market in Wuhan. On Dec. 30, Dr. Li told the newspaper, he sent a message to former classmates on WeChat, a popular messaging app, warning them of new cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS.  He later corrected that, saying it was an unknown coronavirus. Dr. Li was later interrogated by party disciplinary officials and hospital management, who accused him of spreading rumors and forced him to write a self-criticism, he told the newspaper. \"They told me not to publish any information about this online,\" Dr. Li told the Beijing Youth Daily in late January.  \"Later, the epidemic started to spread noticeably.  I'd personally been treating someone who was infected, and whose family got infected, and so then I got infected.\" In speaking out about the virus and about government efforts to silence him, Dr. Li drew comparisons to Jiang Yanyong, a surgeon who became a hero after blowing the whistle on Beijing's efforts to cover up the extent of the SARS crisis in 2003. Initially, a live animal market in Wuhan, where exotic animals are sold for food, was blamed as the source of the virus.  It may yet be proven to be the epicenter of the outbreak, but it was not the source of the virus.  That honor goes to the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory, housed at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a scant 20 miles away from Wuhan's live animal market.  It was set up in the wake of previous leaks of the SARS virus from Chinese labs and to do research on the world's most dangerous viruses.  As the Daily Mail Online reports: It was the first ever lab in the country designed to meet biosafety-level-4 (BSL-4) standards — the highest biohazard level, meaning that it would be qualified to handle the most dangerous pathogens. BSL-4 labs have to be equipped with airtight hazmat suits or special 'cabinet' work spaces that confine viruses and bacteria that can be transmitted through the air to sealed boxes that scientists reach into using attached high-grade gloves. Upon opening, it planned to first take up a project that required only BSL-3 precautions to be in place: a tick-borne virus that causes Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever. It's a highly fatal disease, killing 10 to 40 percent of those it infects. SARS, too, is a BSL-3 virus.  According to Nature's interview with the lab's director, Yuan Zhimin, the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory planned to study the SARS virus. 'After a laboratory leak incident of SARS in 2004, the former Ministry of Health of China initiated the construction of preservation laboratories for high-level pathogens such as SARS, coronavirus, and pandemic influenza virus,' wrote Guizhen Wu. The Wuhan lab is also equipped for animal research. To be clear, this is not to say the Wuhan Virus was part of any biological weapons program or that its release was intentional.  It could just be that it was the result of Chernobyl-like sloppiness resulting from a bizarre blend of Chinese culture and global ambition.  Indications of military involvement in the Wuhan lab are there and troubling. In a New York Post op-ed, Steven W. Mosher, president of the Population Research Institute and the author of Bully of Asia: Why China's \"Dream\" Is the New Threat to World Order, documents the linkage connecting the Wuhan lab, the nearby live animal market, and the spread of the Wuhan Virus: At an emergency meeting in Beijing held last Friday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping spoke about the need to contain the coronavirus and set up a system to prevent similar epidemics in the future. A national system to control biosecurity risks must be put in place \"to protect the people's health,\" Xi said, because lab safety is a \"national security\" issue. What Xi didn't say is that the coronavirus that has sickened more than 76000 and claimed more than 2200 lives escaped from one of the country's bioresearch labs.  But the very next day, evidence emerged suggesting that this is what happened, as the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology released a new directive entitled \"Instructions on strengthening biosecurity management in microbiology labs that handle advanced viruses like the novel coronavirus.\" As Mosher points out, not only is the Wuhan lab China's first level-4 facility, but it is the only one, and it is under close and active supervision by the Chinese military: The People's Liberation Army's top expert in biological warfare, Maj. Gen. Chen Wei, was dispatched to Wuhan at the end of January to help with the effort to contain the outbreak. According to the PLA Daily, Chen has been researching coronaviruses since the SARS outbreak of 2003, as well as Ebola and anthrax.  This would not be her first trip to the Wuhan Institute of Virology either, since it is one of only two bioweapons research labs in all of China. Clearly, this People's Liberation Army officer was there not just to preserve the public order after something went awry in their quest to find a cure for the common cold.  You don't need a general doing research on coronaviruses at bioweapons research labs to impose a quarantine. Worse yet, the virus may have been released by underpaid researchers who sold contaminated lab animals to make a little extra cash on the side: And then there is this little-known fact: Some Chinese researchers are believed to sell laboratory animals to street vendors after they have finished experimenting on them. Instead of properly disposing of infected animals by cremation, as the law requires, they sell them on the side to make a little extra cash.  Or, in some cases, a lot of extra cash.  One Beijing researcher, now in jail, made the equivalent of a million dollars selling monkeys and rats on the live animal market, whence they likely wound up in someone's stomach. This isn't the first made-in-China virus Beijing has sprung on the world.  And it won't be the last unless we stop worrying about political correctness and sanction China for what amounts to economic warfare and negligent homicide on a global scale.The Wuhan Virus Escaped from a Chinese Lab\n",

      "There are many conspiracy theories – some believe that reptilians are running the US government and others believe that Coca-Cola uses the blood of Christian babies to produce its soft drinks. There are people who have seen “chemtrails” and others who advocate wearing tinfoil hats when watching television to protect from destructive brainwashing waves. Often, the prophecies of Scripture are interpreted as a commentary on some technological discovery or event. But there are also rational facts that it doesn’t make sense to deny because they are documented. These include the existence of the Bilderberg club, the CIA’s MK-Ultra project, and George Soros’ funding of dubious political activities in a number of countries.The case described below relates to an officially documented fact, although there is something rather biblical about it. Patent WO/2020/060606 was registered on 26 March 2020. The patent application was filed by Microsoft Technology Licensing, LLC, headed by Bill Gates, back on 20 June 2019, and, on 22 April 2020, the patent was granted international status. The title of the patent is “Cryptocurrency system using body activity data”.So, what is this invention that the people at Microsoft decided to patent? The abstract of the patent application online states: “Human body activity associated with a task provided to a user may be used in a mining process of a cryptocurrency system. A server may provide a task to a device of a user which is communicatively coupled to the server. A sensor communicatively coupled to or comprised in the device of the user may sense body activity of the user. Body activity data may be generated based on the sensed body activity of the user. The cryptocurrency system communicatively coupled to the device of the user may verify if the body activity data satisfies one or more conditions set by the cryptocurrency system, and award cryptocurrency to the user whose body activity data is verified.”\n",
      "In other words, a chip will be inserted into the body that monitors a person’s daily physical activity in return for cryptocurrency. If conditions are met, then the person receives certain bonuses that can be spent on something.A detailed description of the “invention” provides 28 concepts for how the device could be used.\n",
      "It also provides a list of countries for which the invention is intended. Essentially, this is all the members of the United Nations and a few regional organisations specified separately – the European Patent Office, the Eurasian Patent Organization, and two African intellectual property protection organisations.\n",
      "Although inserting microchips into the body is nothing new – the Masonic Youth Child Identification Program has been in operation in the US for a while, and people calling themselves cyborgs exhibit various implants – Microsoft’s involvement is interesting. And why has the patent been given the code number 060606? Is it a coincidence or the deliberate choice of what is referred to in the Book of Revelation as the number of the beast?\n",
      "ill Gates’ name is constantly being mentioned these days in connection with his interests in pharmaceutical companies, vaccinations, and WHO funding. Although the globalist media try to highlight Bill Gates as a great philanthropist and protect him from attacks and criticism in every way possible, it is unlikely they’ll be able to conceal a whole web of connections.Bill Gates’ company is involved in another project – the digital ID project ID2020 Alliance. On the website’s homepage, it says that the project has been addressing the issue of digital rights since 2016. In 2018, the Alliance worked with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Besides Microsoft, the Alliance includes the Rockefeller Foundation, the design studio IDEO.org (with offices in San Francisco and New York), the consulting firm Accenture, and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance – a company that actively promotes and distributes various vaccines around the world. The Secretariat for the Alliance is based in New York.It is telling that Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance mostly covers countries in Africa and Asia. In Europe, the organisation is only active in Albania, Croatia, Moldova and Ukraine, and, in the Caucasus, in Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance also has links with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the World Bank Group, the World Health Organization, and UNICEF. These are all listed as founding partners!Since February 2020, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance has been focusing on the coronavirus pandemic. The organisation’s CEO is Dr Seth Berkley. Although the headquarters of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance are in Geneva, Berkley himself, an epidemiologist by training, is from New York. Since the late 1980s, he has spent eight years working at the Rockefeller Foundation and is a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. He is also an advisory council member of the New York-based Acumen Fund.So, yet another link has been found. Theological interpretations of the patent number are probably best left to experts on religion, but it is clear that there are strong links between organisations and companies like the Rockefeller Foundation, Microsoft, the pharmaceutical lobby and the World Bank Group, not to mention secondary service providers. They are trying to play the role of a supranational government by constantly focusing on the fact that, these days, national governments cannot cope with epidemics, illnesses, famines, etc. single-handed. But, as China has shown, they can. The West cannot and does not want to acknowledge this, however, largely because it does not want to share power. So, the globalist media will continue their information campaigns, where the blame will be placed anywhere but on the West. It is telling that right now, as additional information on the coronavirus has started to emerge, false stories on China’s role in the epidemic have been stepped up and statistics manipulated.BILL GATES, VACCINATIONS, MICROCHIPS, AND PATENT 060606\n",

When a patient is already in hospital severely ill, this would be the best solution to help save her or his life.\"Winning the hospital game. When faced with hospitalization, the most powerful person in the most entire hospital system is the patient. However, in most cases, the system works on the assumption that the patient will not claim that power. If on your way in you signed the hospital's legal consent form, you can unsign it. You can revoke your permission. Just because somebody has permission to do one thing doesn't mean that they have the permission to do everything. There's no such thing as a situation that you cannot reverse. You can change your mind about your own personal healthcare. It concerns your very life. The rights of the patient override the rules of any institution.If the patient doesn't know that, or if they're not conscious, or if they just don't have the moxie to do it, the next most powerful person is the spouse. The spouse has enormous influence and can do almost as much as the patient. If the patient is incapacitated, the spouse can, and must, do all the more. If there is no spouse present, the next most powerful people in the system are the children of the patient.When you go to the hospital, bring along a big red pen, and cross out anything that you don't like in the hospital's permission form. And before you sign it, add anything you want. Write out \"I want intravenous vitamin C, 25 grams per day, until I state otherwise.\" And should they say, \"We're not going to admit you,\" you reply, \"Please put it in writing that you refuse to admit me.\" What do you think their lawyers are going to do with that? They have to admit you. It's a game, and you can win it. But you can't win it if you don't know the rules. And basically, they don't tell you the rules.This is deadly serious. Medical mistakes are now the third leading cause of death in the US. Yes, medical errors kill over 400000 Americans every year. That's 1100 each day, every day.There are mistakes of commission and mistakes of omission. Failure to provide intravenous vitamin C is, literally, a grave omission. Do not allow yourself or your loved ones to be deprived of a simple, easy to prepare and administer IV of vitamin C.\"If a family member of mine died due to coronavirus infection, after a doctor refused to use intravenous vitamin C, I would challenge his or her treatment in a court of law. I would win.\"It can be done. Vitamin IVs can be arranged in virtually any hospital, anywhere in the world. Attorney and cardiologist Thomas E. Levy's very relevant presentation is free access. Both the letter and the intent of new USA legislation now make this easier for you.\"The new federal Right to Try Act provides patients suffering from life-threatening diseases or conditions the right to use investigational drugs... It amends the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to exempt investigational drugs provided to patients who have exhausted approved treatment options and are unable to participate in a clinical trial involving the drug. Advocates of right to try laws have sought to accelerate access to new drugs for terminally ill patients who are running out of options. Arguably, the law does not represent a radical change in this and several other states, however, because in 2016, California had already joined the majority of other states in adopting a law enabling physicians to help terminally ill patients pursue investigational therapies, without fear of Medical Board or state civil or criminal liability. . . The new Right to Try law should give physicians, as well as drug manufacturers, some added comfort about FDA enforcement in these cases.\"\n",
      "Therefore, in regards to intravenous vitamin C, do not accept stories that \"the hospital can't\" or \"the doctor can't\" or that \"the state won't allow it.\" If you hear any of this malarkey, please send the Orthomolecular Medicine News Service the text of the policy or the law that says so.

This P4 Lab, a collaboration between Chinese Academy of Sciences and Wuhan municipal government, was completed on January 31, 2015 and officially began its operation on January 5, 2018. It is China’s first the biosafety level 4 laboratory (BSL-4 Lab) and the third one in Asia (DT-L2), Here the content will be divided into the following sections:The history of Wuhan Institute of Virology, France China Relationship and the P4 Lab, France China Foundation. The P4 Lab: Organization Chart of Wuhan’s P4 Lab, Literature Highlights, Key persons, Intriguing Facts, Summary, Epilogue: Evidence of connections to Jiang Family – Pandora’s Box. History of the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), Chinese Academy of Sciences: (DT-L5-11). In1956, the Wuhan Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences was established.In November 1961, the Wuhan Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences was renamed the Central South Institute of Microbiology.\n",
      "In October 1962, the Central South Institute of Microbiology was renamed to the Wuhan Institute of Microbiology.In 1966, the local branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences was relegated to the leadership of Hubei Province.In 1970, it was renamed to the Hubei Institute of Microbiology.In 1978, before the Science and Technology Conference, it returned to the Chinese Academy of Sciences and was renamed to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.In 2002, it entered the sequence of the National Science and Technology Innovation Projects of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.\n",
      "In 2003, the “One, Three, Five” (One goal with 3 five-year) Plan was carried out.\n",
      "In November 2004, the establishment of the State Key Laboratory of Virology was approved by the Ministry of Science and Technology. The lab is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education, and supervised by both Wuhan University and Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.\n",
      "In January 2012, the China Virus Resource Center of the Institute was approved by China Quality Certification Center, and obtained ISO9001: 2008 quality management system certificate, ISO14001: 2004 environmental management system certificate, and GB / T28001-2001 occupational health and safety management system certificate. In June, the Animal Experiment Center of Zhengdian Science Park of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences began operation.In 2012, Public Technical Service Center of the Wuhan Institute of Virology’s was established and consisted of an analysis and testing center, a BSL-3 laboratory, an experimental animal center, a radioisotope laboratory, and a network information center.In 2014, the first action plan of the Big Science Center was launched.In January 2015, China’s first laboratory with the highest level of biosafety protection, the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory (namely, Wuhan BSL-4 Laboratory) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences was completed. In December, it was rated as a civilized unit in Hubei Province.In July 2016, the Wuhan Institute of Virology held a ground-breaking ceremony for a comprehensive experimental research base of virology and biosafety.In January 2018, Wuhan National Biosafety Level 4 Laboratory (BSL-4 Laboratory) passed the national standard.Using P4 Laboratory as the centre and under the cooperative relationship between France and China, the framework agreement proposed to synchronize the “four wheels” – scientific research cooperation, personnel training, laws, regulations, and standards, and laboratory construction- making laboratory construction affected by changes in Sino-French cooperation relations.On June 28, 2004, Chen Zhu, then the vice president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, clearly instructed the WIV, “based on the principles of friendly cooperation between China and France, the collaborative process should differentiate internal (China) from external (France) and use China-centered and practical approaches (DT-L97).In 1997, BioMérieux set up a representative office in Beijing, and in 2004, its Shanghai Branch was established in Asia.On January 28, 2004, during President Hu Jintao’s visit to France, he witnessed the signing of the “Memorandum of Understanding of China-France Cooperation in Preventing and Fighting New Infectious Diseases”:Establish a Sino-French Emerging Infectious Diseases Group composed of representatives of competent French government departments and experts;Support the development of the WIV of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, acquire equipment and technology, and provide training, and cooperate in the field of prevention and combat of emerging infectious diseases.Construction of the P4 Lab has started since 2004!On October 9, 2004, French President Jacques Chirac visited Beijing to officially sign a cooperative agreement on the prevention and control of emerging infectious diseases between the two countries.On November 1, 2007, French Foreign Minister Kouchner visited China and made a statement on the P4 project.\n",
      "On November 26, 2007, French President Nicolas Sarkozy visited China and signed a statement on a cooperative agreement on the prevention and control of emerging infectious diseases, emphasizing to “ensure that all necessary measures are taken as soon as possible to implement all projects including the Wuhan P4 laboratory.In 2008, the French side delivered a laboratory drawing, and in 2009, the Chinese Yuan Design Institute provided the Chinese design drawing. In the design process, the key concepts of Lyon Lab Design are referenced.On May 10, 2010, the China-France Cooperation Conference on Emerging Infectious Diseases was held in Beijing, which further promoted the laboratory construction process.On January 9, 2012, the key equipment of the core laboratory-airtight doors and life support systems arrived at Jiangxia Zhengdian Park. The quality was checked and approved.On January 9, 2012, the key equipment of the core laboratory—airtight doors and life supporting systems—was delivered to Jiangxia Zhengdian Park and passed the quality check.On March 26, 2014, Xi Jinping visited the French Merrier Centre for Biological Research and listened to the introduction of the development of the center. Xi pointed out: “P4 laboratory construction in Wuhan is very important for Chinese public health and a good symbol of the France China Collaboration in public health. On January 31, 2015, Wuhan P4 Lab held a completion and unveiling ceremony, which marked the completion of the laboratory’s hardware construction and installation of major facilities and equipment. According to the participating French engineers and technicians, China’s P4 laboratory is more advanced than the one in Lyon, France.On January 31, 2015, Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory (Wuhan P4 Laboratory), the National Academy of Sciences was completed to conduct research on avian influenza, coronavirus and other virus epidemic prevention. This laboratory is the Sino-French Emerging Infectious Diseases Cooperative Project of the Mérieux Foundation.

The reasons for the emergence of genetic weapon-type new infectious diseases; what are biological weapons; biomolecular evolution and phylogeny; contemporary genetic (human-made new species pathogens and pathogenic genes) weapons and their deployment; and no SARS coronavirus in nature and among human and its reason etc.SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are highly pathogenic and can cause severe acute respiratory syndrome in human with high mortality rates. The virus is thought to originate in bats.The S proteins of different coronaviruses show different efficiencies in mediating pseudoviral infections and this includes the coronavirus genome, which is the largest genome of RNA viruses, consists of a sense, single-stranded RNA, about 30 kb in size.Coronaviruses (CoVs) infect a wide range of vertebrates, including humans. They can cause respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatic and central nervous system diseases. Some CoVs have managed to across the species barrier, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV. This special issue of Virologica Sinica is dedicated to the recent progress on coronaviruses and covers topics on viral epidemiology, virus replication and the interactions between the coronaviruses and their hosts. This updated information would provide new insights in the control of CoV infections, and in the development of effective antivirals.

      "RUSH: Folks, this coronavirus thing, I want to try to put this in perspective for you. It looks like the coronavirus is being weaponized as yet another element to bring down Donald Trump. Now, I want to tell you the truth about the coronavirus. (interruption) You think I’m wrong about this? You think I’m missing it by saying that’s… (interruption) Yeah, I’m dead right on this. The coronavirus is the common cold, folks.The Drive-By Media hype of this thing as a pandemic, as the Andromeda strain, as, “Oh, my God, if you get it, you’re dead.” Do you know what the — I think the survival rate is 98%. Ninety-eight percent of people get the coronavirus survive. It’s a respiratory system virus. It probably is a ChiCom laboratory experiment that is in the process of being weaponized. All superpower nations weaponize bioweapons. They experiment with them. The Russians, for example, have weaponized fentanyl. Now, fentanyl is also not what it is represented to be.If you watch cop shows, then you probably… Stick with me on this. If you watch cop shows, you probably believe that just the dust from a package of fentanyl can kill you if you’re in the same room with it. Not true. Not true. Even the cheap kind of fentanyl coming from China that’s used to spike heroin… They use fentanyl ’cause it’s cheap. It gives a quick hit, doesn’t last very long, which is really cool if you’re trying to addict people.But it doesn’t kill people the way it’s projected on TV. It can if you OD on it. But inhaling a little fentanyl dust is not going to cause you to lose consciousness and stop breathing as they depict on cop shows. It’s dangerous. Don’t misunderstand. But it isn’t the way it’s portrayed in popular criminal TV shows, cop shows, and so forth and so on. The coronavirus is the same. It’s really being hyped as a deadly Andromeda Strain or Ebola pandemic that, “Oh, my God, is going to wipe out the nation. It’s going to wipe out the population of the world.”The stock market’s down like 900 points right now. The survival rate of this is 98%! You have to read very deeply to find that number, that 2% of the people get the coronavirus die. That’s less than the flu, folks. That is a far lower death statistic than any form of influenza, which is an annual thing that everybody gets shots for. There’s nothing unusual about the coronavirus. In fact, coronavirus is not something new. There are all kinds of viruses that have that name. Now, do not misunderstand. I’m not trying to get you to let your guard down.Nobody wants to get any of this stuff. I mean, you never… I hate getting the common cold. You don’t want to get the flu. It’s miserable. But we’re not talking about something here that’s gonna wipe out your town or your city if it finds its way there. This is a classic illustration of how media coverage works. Even if this media coverage isn’t stacked, even if this is just the way media normally does things, this is a hyped, panic-filled version. It’s exactly how the media deals with these things to create audience, readership, interest, clicks, what have you.It originated in China in a little — well, not a little town. It’s a town that is 11 million people, Wuhan, China. One of the reasons they’re able to hype this is that the doctor what warned everybody about it came down with it and died. So if a doctor got it, “Oh, my God, Rush! A doctor got it? You can’t possibly be right if a doctor can’t protect himself.” He didn’t know what he was dealing with. He discovered it back in December. I’m telling you, the ChiComs are trying to weaponize this thing. Here’s the story on Russians and fentanyl.Fentanyl is a very, very powerful opiate — and for those of you that haven’t had any experience with opiates, the people that get addicted to ’em take them and they get very euphoric. They kill pain. They do wonderful things. But they make you very, very euphoric. They act like speed. Other people take ’em, and they hate ’em. It makes ’em vomit, throw up, feel nauseous. It doesn’t do anything for ’em. They’re never gonna get addicted.So in Moscow the Chechens, way back… I’m gonna go back now — what is it — maybe 10 years or longer. A bunch of Chechen rebels took over an opera house and had a bunch of Russian hostages in there and made all kinds of threats — and Putin, unbeknownst to anybody, had weaponized fentanyl. He’d turned it into a gas, an invisible gas. He just put it in the ventilation system of this opera house or whatever it was (I’m giving you the sketchy, short version of this) and everybody in there fell asleep and died. You know, in a drug overdose, you stop breathing.That’s what… It slows down your respiratory system so much that you stop breathing. That’s what an OD is, and everybody in that place, including the Chechens — Pfft! — had no idea what happened to ’em. It’s not violent. You just fall asleep for unknown reasons at the amounts that Putin weaponized and put in there. If you take a normal dose of fentanyl that you get from a doctor in a hospital, it’s not gonna kill you, obviously. But the amount they weaponized — and up to this time, nobody had ever weaponized fentanyl.Nobody had ever made it into an invisible, odorless, colorless gas, until it was discovered that the Russians had done it. Well, every nation is working on things like this, and the ChiComs obviously in their lab are doing something here with the coronavirus — and it got out. Some people believe it got out on purpose, that the ChiComs have a whole lot of problems based on an economy that cannot provide for the number of people they have. So losing a few people here or there is not so bad for the Chinese government.There could be anything to explain this.But the way it’s being used… I believe the way it’s being weaponized is by virtue of the media, and I think that it is an effort to bring down Trump, and one of the ways it’s being used to do this is to scare the investors, to scare people in business. It’s to scare people into not buying Treasury bills at auctions. It’s to scare people into leaving, cashing out of the stock market — and sure enough, as the show began today, the stock market — the Dow Jones Industrial Average — was down about 900 points, supposedly because of the latest news about the spread of the coronavirus.And if you go deeper into China, you will see that all of the high-tech Silicon Valley firms are said to be terribly exposed. “They could be suffering a disastrous year. Why, you may not be able to buy a new iPhone of any model this whole year! Do you know that? Because the coronavirus is so bad that the factories may never open — and if they do, they may not be anywhere near full capacity.” So Apple may not be able to release any new product. You think that’s not gonna panic investors? It most certainly is.So Apple is trying to do what they can to suggest that these rumors are not true. They got new products coming this year. But the tech media hates Apple. They love anti-Apple stories. They love anything that will let them report that Apple’s on its last legs. Of course, that’s not true. Warren Buffett came out today and said, “Apple is the best run company ever.” He’s a big stockholder. So people will say he’s biased about it. But the bias you have to pay attention to is how much money he invested. He got $36 billion in Apple stock that Berkshire Hathaway has.They sold $800 million of Apple stock last week, and everybody said, “Oh, my God, he’s getting out!” No, he’s not. He’s got $36 billion. He sold $800 million. No big deal. He wanted to allocate it somewhere else. So this is… I think the coronavirus is an effort to get Trump. It’s not gonna work. It’s one of the latest in a long line of efforts that the Drive-By Media’s making to somehow say that Trump and capitalism are destroying America and destroying the world. Just keep in mind where the coronavirus came from.It came from a country that Bernie Sanders wants to turn the United States into a mirror image of: Communist China. That’s where it came from. It didn’t come from an American lab. It didn’t escape from an American research lab. It hasn’t been spread by Americans. It starts out in a communist country. Its tentacles spread all across the world in numbers that are not big and not huge, but they’re being reported as just the opposite. Just trying to keep it all in perspective.\n",
      "BREAK TRANSCRIPT. RUSH: Here’s Neil in Orlando. Great to have you on the program, sir. Hello.CALLER: Hello, Rush. Man, I’m blessed to have the chance to talk to you. I cannot believe it. So you were talking about the coronavirus a little bit a while ago, and what’s the one thing that disappeared when the coronavirus came out?RUSH: Well, let me see. What one thing? Just hang on. What disappeared? What disappeared? What disappeared? Oh, the protests in Hong Kong went away.CALLER: Yes. That’s it.RUSH: That’s a big. CALLER: Yup.RUSH: (whispering) Talent on loan from God.CALLER: That sure is.RUSH: That’s probably the big one, the protests in Hong Kong.CALLER: That’s my take from it. I don’t know. I’ve got a friend over there that sends me stuff. But there’s a lot… We don’t want to start any conspiracy theories, but this will be my only time I ever get through to you ’cause I’ve been calling since ’92. But I just want to say about your talent on loan from God: Just in the time, I was on hold listening to you, and it got me to the point where I just wanted to say that Trump got no notice about Russian meddling like Sanders did. So why not? I wonder about that. When Carter was president, my first home buying — I was a first-time home buyer — the rate was 13.33%. I’ll never forget it, and that was a first-time homeowner!RUSH: I know. I know.CALLER: That was a deal!RUSH: I know. I know.CALLER: That was a deal at 13.33%!RUSH: I bought my first shack, you know, at that time in Overland Park, Kansas. I had no business buying it. But everybody said, “You gotta buy! Don’t rent. You’re throwing money away if you rent.”CALLER: Mmm-hmm.RUSH: So, you know, my one time I became a conformist, it got me. I didn’t want to live in this shack! I never wanted to move into this shack. But it’s what I bought, so I had to move into the thing.CALLER: And one more .RUSH: I didn’t even want people to take me home. I didn’t want people to see this shack that I lived in. One day, we’re playing football — the Chiefs front office, the Royals front office — after the baseball season. Thursday afternoon flag football. George Brett’s playing and he offered to take me home. I said (chuckles), “No, George, I’m fine.” I didn’t want Brett to see where the shack was. So, yeah, 13% interest rates during Carter, and it was bad. Carter actually coined the term “malaise” to describe his own administration and its effect on the American economy!We had “the misery index” and all of that.But look, back to the coronavirus for just a second. That is true that the Hong Kong protests strangely subsided as the news of the coronavirus expanded — and I’ll tell you, it is a way… If you are a totalitarian government and you need to control your population, one of the best ways of doing it is unleashing something they think is a deadly disease and then you, as the dictator, have the “safety solutions.” You have the ability to round people up from their homes and take ’em to so-called health camps.Be very leery of this, folks.It probably is not what the media’s leading you to believe it is.Overhyped Coronavirus Weaponized Against Trump\n",

      "I live in China. This year, like every other, people with severely compromised immune systems were and are suffering from pneumonia. In early January 2020, in Wuhan, China – a place with dreadful air quality—hospitals started receiving patients.In fact, for most of November, all of December, and most of January, the air quality index (AQI) was so bad that local governments regularly issued standard health warnings due to high levels of particulate matter. (At my school in Shanghai, if the AQI is over 150, children are cannot play outside. This is based on government advisories.)And please be aware, far from hiding the problem, government officials in China at the regional and national level, readily provide daily and historical reports of the air quality index, noting particulate matter (PM2.5) and more. Thus we can track data for Wuhan — and most other large cities and urban areas — for the past six years.Unsurprisingly, those diagnosed with severe forms of COVID-19 are the elderly and immunocompromised. Additionally, people who have a host of pre-existing conditions are at higher risk. (NEJM March 30th, 2020). The Boston-based non-profit, Health Effects Institute, says anywhere from 500000 to 1250000 Chinese die due to air pollution alone each year. (see pages 11-13). But the question this report discusses is, “When people have pneumonia or other respiratory difficulties, what are the best treatment protocols?”Ceep it Cimple Ctupid: Intravenous Vitamin C … Again?All across China, not just in Wuhan, but also in other cities that saw pneumonia cases (and note, Chinese medical teams discuss COVID-19 as pneumonia), people are being cured with vitamin C.I am including the details from a public report written in Chinese and published by a medical team Xibei Hospital, affiliated with Jiao Tong University, in the city of Xi’an, Shaanxi province. (To complete the translation I used a combination of programs and resources:  Google Translate, Pleco, and Baidu Fanyi).Given what the doctors in Xi’an knew of reports from Wuhan (which is 500 miles away from Xi’an, in the neighboring province of Hubei), and from seeing pneumonia patients in early February 2020, a team at the Xibei Hospital, devised a protocol centered on the use of intravenous (IV) vitamin C against the Coronavirus. They first treated patients on February 10th. Critically ill patients received 200 mg of soluble vitamin C per kg body weight, once every 12 hours. After the first two treatments, the patient would get 100 mg/kg, every 24 hours, for the next four days. (Those presenting with moderate symptoms were given 100 mg/kg on day one).Arguably, these doses are too low. Practitioners and researchers like Dr. Suzanne Humphries (2014) and Thomas Levy, J.D., Ph.D. (2017), posit that intravenous infusions of vitamin C should be from 50-100g per day, and can be repeated every 3-7 days.The Xibei Protocol.Using the Xibei protocol, a person weighing 70 kg (154 pounds), would receive a total of 28 grams of vitamin C on the first day. Thereafter, they would receive 7 g per day. The clinical trial in Wuhan gave similar doses. On February 14th, 2020, the university hospital started giving pneumonia patients a non-body weight-dependent dose of 12 g of vitamin C every 12 hours for seven days.Even with their relatively low doses, patients in Xi’an were released after four to eight days of vitamin C. Thus, the protocol, emphasizing the antioxidant, ascorbic acid, has been a clear success.Nevertheless, my question is, Why don’t we hear of anything about intravenous vitamin C as a routine practice in the United States, or even in other developed countries with reported COVID19 cases like Italy, Spain, Germany, France, or Iran?What Does the Research Say about Vitamin C?The teams in China did not choose to administer vitamin C due to mere guesswork. To make the decision, they cited the medical literature and used their knowledge about respiratory diseases and oxidative stress.Dr. Zhi Yong Peng, at the Zhongnan Hospital, at Wuhan University, justified his decision to use vitamin C, noting:For most viral infections, there is a lack of effective antiviral drugs … Vitamin C, ascorbic acid, has antioxidant properties. Clinical studies have shown that vitamin C can effectively prevent [sepsis and related cytokine storms]. In addition, vitamin C can [protect the lungs].Vitamin C can effectively shorten the duration of (or even prevent) the common cold. In a controlled … trial, 85% of 252 students experienced a reduction in [cold] symptoms, [after receiving] high-dose vitamin C group (1g per hour for 6 hours, followed by 1g every 8 hours).Xibei Report on Vitamin C.According to the Xibei Hospital (2020) report:For patients with severe neonatal pneumonia and critically ill patients, vitamin C treatments should be initiated as soon as possible after admission. This is because whether the illness was similiar to infections seen in the past like Keshan disease, SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), or the current new [COVID19] pneumonia, the main cause of death of patients is cardiopulmonary failure caused by increased acute oxidative stress. When the virus causes increased oxidative stress in the body and increased capillary permeability, early application of large doses of vitamin C can have a strong antioxidant effect, reduce inflammatory responses, and improve endothelial (heart tissue) function.They add:Numerous studies have shown that treatment with doses of vitamin C promote excellent results. Our past experience in successfully rescuing acute Keshan disease and current studies at home and abroad show that high-dose vitamin C can not only improve viral resistance, but more importantly, can prevent and treat acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress (ARDS).Why not nutrition?Dr. Thomas Levy has written many books and has given many lectures on the benefits of vitamin C for curing disease and body detoxification. Of course, Levy attributes this information great pioneer Frederick Klenner, MD. Klenner used ascorbic acid and developed protocols with intravenous and intramuscular applications of high dose vitamin C. He was published as early as 1949—reporting cures of polio, measles, mumps, chickenpox and more.\n",
      "Because I knew of the benefits of high dose vitamin C in early February, I encouraged four ex-pat doctors, working in Wenzhou, China, to give it to their patients. Wenzhou, a city of over 10 million, was the second Chinese city placed under a complete quarantine. These doctors ridiculed me and scoffed at the idea that nutrition could provide any relief to coronavirus patients. One actually said: “A vaccine is the only solution, as a virus has no effective treatment.” I voiced my objection to that idea, and had plans to use the antiviral drugs — then being touted by the WHO.Again, I insisted that antioxidants could save the sick. To this, the M.D. added: “Nutrition is important, but if nutrition is enough, why do governments make hospitals and medical colleges?”Why, indeed.What about Selenium?When I read the press release and protocol from Jiao Tong University Hospital, I wanted to learn more about Keshan disease. That rabbit hole only introduced me to more evidence that confirmed how nutrition can cure. Below are some excerpts from the Wikipedia entry on Keshan disease:Keshan disease, named after Keshan County of Heilongjiang province in Northeast China, is a congestive cardiomyopathy caused by a combination of dietary deficiency of selenium and the presence of a mutated [sic] strain of Coxsackievirus [sic] … Often fatal, the disease afflicts children and women of child-bearing age. It is characterized by heart failure and pulmonary edema.After reading all the references cited by the Wiki page, I concluded the following about Keshan disease and the state of scientific knowledge:Symptoms of respiratory difficulty and congestive heart disease were found to be prevalent in a wide belt of territory extending from northeast to southwest China (including parts of Shaanxi province. (See Ge and Yang 1979); those areas which are replete with selenium-deficient soils.The research holds that Keshan disease peaked from 1960–1970, when thousands died of the disease. And during that decade, China experienced a man-made famine. Then followed by food shortages, especially in rural parts of China.Intentional dietary supplementation with selenium reduced the incidence and harm of Keshan disease in China. (See Ge and Yang 1979).Keshan Disease\n",
      "Beck et al. (2003) cited a 1979 report from China. The report declared, unequivocally: “Populations living in areas of China with selenium-rich soils did not develop Keshan disease.”Given their interest, Beck et al. (2003) conducted research into the role of selenium and Keshan disease. They concluded:\n",
      "“[Experiments with mice] suggest that together with the deficiency in selenium, an infection with coxsackievirus was required for the development of Keshan disease.”Please appreciate the idea that viruses cause disease is not universally accepted—and arguably wrong for Keshan disease in particular. Ge and Yang (1979) claimed that Keshan disease was and is not related to any virus. Instead, they note it as seasonal – coming in the winter. Ge and Yang (1979) explored the question of a viral cause for Keshan disease but rejected that hypothesis due to a lack of evidence. Though most medical practitioners insist that viruses cause disease, recall that in 2005, Peter Doshi discovered that despite claims that influenza virus kills thousands of Americans every year, for 2001, America had only 18 confirmed flu deaths.\n",
      "The lack of evidence for a viral infection causing Keshan disease and the failure to find a flu virus in fatalities attributed to a virus should guide our thinking about COVID-19 today. Remember, the Chinese doctors in Xi’an treat pneumonia as pneumonia. And they lump together different viruses (SARS, MERS, etc.), saying that each causes oxidative stress.Oxidative Stress.If disease—all disease—is really about oxidative stress, as Dr. Thomas Levy holds, maybe the type of virus is irrelevant. Keep in mind, even though virologists categorize many types of viruses, there are no true species of viruses (Racaniello 2019, Lecture #1, minutes 56-57).To determine whether selenium deficiency was a specific link to the coxsackievirus, Beck et al. (2003) injected the influenza virus into selenium-deficient mice and mice fed with adequate amounts of selenium. As we should expect, the selenium-deficient mice had more severe pathology, more inflammatory distress, and produced more T-cells, antibodies, and hormones when they developed the respiratory infection.Consider that the viruses associated with pneumonia and other types of respiratory distress are different. In human populations, we generally see respiratory ailments with flu-like symptoms, and/or pneumonia, during the winter months. Additionally, we see respiratory illness in persons depleted of an essential antioxidant, selenium. That is, they are suffering from oxidative stress when exposed to the pathogen.Deficiency in Cuba.Going back to Beck et al. (2003), because their investigation into Keshan disease attributed the ailment to both selenium deficiency and a virus [sic], the team wanted to bolster their thesis with a case study. They provided some discussion about the relationship between said virus and selenium, in another part of the world—Cuba.During a period of severe nutritional deficit in Cuba (1989-1993), doctors found a rash of patients developing optic and peripheral neuropathy (Beck et al. 2003). The Cuban doctors discovered that their sick patients had oxidative stress due to selenium deficiency, and 84% had some mutated form of coxsackievirus. And the outbreaks occurred in the winter months when vitamin D3 blood-levels would be lowest (Beck et al. 2003).Just putting these few sources together, we know that:people get sick in winter.a virus is not essential to the formation of an illness or disease.More significantly, neither specific viruses nor any distinct diseases have a link to selenium deficiency. Selenium is an antioxidant. And when we raise our antioxidant levels and reduce oxidative stress, we can stay infection-free. Ergo, the key to beating or avoiding pneumonia, a cold, the flu, or any respiratory ailment, is to consume adequate amounts of selenium and vitamin C.Other important nutrients to take as supplements are vitamins A, E, and K, B-complex, magnesium, and zinc.Conquer COVID Craziness—and Encourage Others Too.The last time I took a class at a university was spring 2001. Since that time, I’ve been enjoying the benefits of my virtual university—the Internet. Over the last 20 years, I have heard lectures from professors and researchers on radio, podcasts, and YouTube. We now have access to millions of peer-reviewed articles, books, and historical accounts. I studied the best that our information age can offer. I learn from Drs. Viera Scheibner, Gary Null, Sherri Tenpenny, Thomas Levy, Rashid Buttar, Sherry Rogers, Nick Gonzales, Leonard Coldwell, Linus Pauling, Fred Klenner, Toni Bark, William Kelley, and many more.But I have not just absorbed their information, I have used their work as a jumping-off point to do further research … and you can too.\n",
      "The allopaths either do not know or do not care about nutrition (just ask Allan Smith). There is a general awareness of the intellectual laziness of American physicians. I have observed this after interactions with Western-trained doctors from South Africa, India, and the Middle East, the arrogance of their ignorance is endemic.From my survey of the current news, if you are in America or Europe, all you hear is that the best doctors can offer is hydroxychloroquine, antivirals or a future vaccine. But from the research, we can see that, instead of their pharmaceutical drugs (which can mask symptoms, but do not cure), what we all need is selenium-rich food (or whole food supplements) and high doses of vitamin C.Can We Get Back To Normalcy?There will always be people with viruses and respiratory difficulties. They will be suffering from oxidative stress—and that is NOT contagious. The numbers will rise in the winter when there is less sun. Less sun lowers vitamin D3 levels and reduces the absorption of phosphorous. Additionally, people are more likely to eat more starchy foods and get less vitamin C in their diet.This is why we hear of members of Congress, professional athletes in NBA, NHL, and world-class soccer players testing positive for COVID. These people were not in China, not eating bat soup, and not sharing ventilators with older people in Italian ICU wards. They did not contract an exogenous virus—their bodies made the virus due to oxidative stress. In fact, spontaneous endogenous generation of viruses, referred to by some as exosomes, would explain why Beck et al. (2003) discovered mutated and more virulent strains of the coxsackievirus in their selenium-depleted mice. They also discovered these strains in human subjects with low selenium. This also notes why researchers are forever finding new and mutated versions of viruses.Regardless, as Del Bigtree (2020) showed from the European data (minutes 80-90), in the winter of 2018, death rates across Europe were far higher than today—but there was no declaration of an epidemic or pandemic, and there was no global shut down.No Fear of the Unknown.This is not a time to accept economic stagnation and the social dislocation that will accompany it. It is not a time to fear that which you cannot see (a virus)—especially given that no medical doctor has ever proven that said viruses cause illness. (I will present more on the virus theory in future articles).Get your Vitamin C, selenium, and zinc, wash your hands to prevent bacterial infection and tell your friends to do the same.China Cures Coronavirus with Vitamin C; Research Suggests Selenium\n",

The coronavirus is the common cold, folks.The Drive-By Media hype of this thing as a pandemic, as the Andromeda strain, as, “Oh, my God, if you get it, you’re dead.” Do you know what the — I think the survival rate is 98%. Ninety-eight percent of people get the coronavirus survive. It’s a respiratory system virus. It probably is a ChiCom laboratory experiment that is in the process of being weaponized. All superpower nations weaponize bioweapons. They experiment with them. The Russians, for example, have weaponized fentanyl. Now, fentanyl is also not what it is represented to be.If you watch cop shows, then you probably… Stick with me on this. If you watch cop shows, you probably believe that just the dust from a package of fentanyl can kill you if you’re in the same room with it. Not true. Not true. Even the cheap kind of fentanyl coming from China that’s used to spike heroin… They use fentanyl ’cause it’s cheap. It gives a quick hit, doesn’t last very long, which is really cool if you’re trying to addict people.But it doesn’t kill people the way it’s projected on TV. It can if you OD on it. But inhaling a little fentanyl dust is not going to cause you to lose consciousness and stop breathing as they depict on cop shows. It’s dangerous. Don’t misunderstand. But it isn’t the way it’s portrayed in popular criminal TV shows, cop shows, and so forth and so on. The coronavirus is the same. It’s really being hyped as a deadly Andromeda Strain or Ebola pandemic that, “Oh, my God, is going to wipe out the nation. It’s going to wipe out the population of the world.”The stock market’s down like 900 points right now. The survival rate of this is 98%! You have to read very deeply to find that number, that 2% of the people get the coronavirus die. That’s less than the flu, folks. That is a far lower death statistic than any form of influenza, which is an annual thing that everybody gets shots for. There’s nothing unusual about the coronavirus. In fact, coronavirus is not something new. There are all kinds of viruses that have that name. Now, do not misunderstand. I’m not trying to get you to let your guard down.Nobody wants to get any of this stuff. I mean, you never… I hate getting the common cold. You don’t want to get the flu. It’s miserable. But we’re not talking about something here that’s gonna wipe out your town or your city if it finds its way there. This is a classic illustration of how media coverage works. Even if this media coverage isn’t stacked, even if this is just the way media normally does things, this is a hyped, panic-filled version. It’s exactly how the media deals with these things to create audience, readership, interest, clicks, what have you.It originated in China in a little — well, not a little town. It’s a town that is 11 million people, Wuhan, China. One of the reasons they’re able to hype this is that the doctor what warned everybody about it came down with it and died. So if a doctor got it, “Oh, my God, Rush! A doctor got it? You can’t possibly be right if a doctor can’t protect himself.” He didn’t know what he was dealing with. He discovered it back in December. I’m telling you, the ChiComs are trying to weaponize this thing. Here’s the story on Russians and fentanyl.Fentanyl is a very, very powerful opiate — and for those of you that haven’t had any experience with opiates, the people that get addicted to ’em take them and they get very euphoric. They kill pain. They do wonderful things. But they make you very, very euphoric. They act like speed. Other people take ’em, and they hate ’em. It makes ’em vomit, throw up, feel nauseous. It doesn’t do anything for ’em. They’re never gonna get addicted.So in Moscow the Chechens, way back… I’m gonna go back now — what is it — maybe 10 years or longer. A bunch of Chechen rebels took over an opera house and had a bunch of Russian hostages in there and made all kinds of threats — and Putin, unbeknownst to anybody, had weaponized fentanyl. He’d turned it into a gas, an invisible gas. He just put it in the ventilation system of this opera house or whatever it was (I’m giving you the sketchy, short version of this) and everybody in there fell asleep and died. You know, in a drug overdose, you stop breathing.That’s what… It slows down your respiratory system so much that you stop breathing. That’s what an OD is, and everybody in that place, including the Chechens — Pfft! — had no idea what happened to ’em. It’s not violent. You just fall asleep for unknown reasons at the amounts that Putin weaponized and put in there. If you take a normal dose of fentanyl that you get from a doctor in a hospital, it’s not gonna kill you, obviously. But the amount they weaponized — and up to this time, nobody had ever weaponized fentanyl.Nobody had ever made it into an invisible, odorless, colorless gas, until it was discovered that the Russians had done it. Well, every nation is working on things like this, and the ChiComs obviously in their lab are doing something here with the coronavirus — and it got out. Some people believe it got out on purpose, that the ChiComs have a whole lot of problems based on an economy that cannot provide for the number of people they have. So losing a few people here or there is not so bad for the Chinese government.There could be anything to explain this.But the way it’s being used… I believe the way it’s being weaponized is by virtue of the media, and I think that it is an effort to bring down Trump, and one of the ways it’s being used to do this is to scare the investors, to scare people in business. It’s to scare people into not buying Treasury bills at auctions. It’s to scare people into leaving, cashing out of the stock market — and sure enough, as the show began today, the stock market — the Dow Jones Industrial Average — was down about 900 points, supposedly because of the latest news about the spread of the coronavirus.And if you go deeper into China, you will see that all of the high-tech Silicon Valley firms are said to be terribly exposed. “They could be suffering a disastrous year. Why, you may not be able to buy a new iPhone of any model this whole year! Do you know that? Because the coronavirus is so bad that the factories may never open — and if they do, they may not be anywhere near full capacity.” So Apple may not be able to release any new product. You think that’s not gonna panic investors? It most certainly is.So Apple is trying to do what they can to suggest that these rumors are not true. They got new products coming this year. But the tech media hates Apple. They love anti-Apple stories. They love anything that will let them report that Apple’s on its last legs. Of course, that’s not true. Warren Buffett came out today and said, “Apple is the best run company ever.” He’s a big stockholder. So people will say he’s biased about it. But the bias you have to pay attention to is how much money he invested. He got $36 billion in Apple stock that Berkshire Hathaway has.They sold $800 million of Apple stock last week, and everybody said, “Oh, my God, he’s getting out!” No, he’s not. He’s got $36 billion. He sold $800 million. No big deal. He wanted to allocate it somewhere else. So this is… I think the coronavirus is an effort to get Trump. It’s not gonna work. It’s one of the latest in a long line of efforts that the Drive-By Media’s making to somehow say that Trump and capitalism are destroying America and destroying the world. Just keep in mind where the coronavirus came from.It came from a country that Bernie Sanders wants to turn the United States into a mirror image of: Communist China. That’s where it came from. It didn’t come from an American lab. It didn’t escape from an American research lab. It hasn’t been spread by Americans. It starts out in a communist country. Its tentacles spread all across the world in numbers that are not big and not huge, but they’re being reported as just the opposite. Just trying to keep it all in perspective.BREAK TRANSCRIPT.RUSH: Here’s Neil in Orlando. Great to have you on the program, sir. Hello.CALLER: Hello, Rush. Man, I’m blessed to have the chance to talk to you. I cannot believe it. So you were talking about the coronavirus a little bit a while ago, and what’s the one thing that disappeared when the coronavirus came out?RUSH: Well, let me see. What one thing? Just hang on. What disappeared? What disappeared? What disappeared? Oh, the protests in Hong Kong went away.CALLER: Yes. That’s it.RUSH: That’s a big.CALLER: Yup.RUSH: (whispering) Talent on loan from God.CALLER: That sure is.RUSH: That’s probably the big one, the protests in Hong Kong.CALLER: That’s my take from it. I don’t know. I’ve got a friend over there that sends me stuff. But there’s a lot… We don’t want to start any conspiracy theories, but this will be my only time I ever get through to you ’cause I’ve been calling since ’92. But I just want to say about your talent on loan from God: Just in the time, I was on hold listening to you, and it got me to the point where I just wanted to say that Trump got no notice about Russian meddling like Sanders did. So why not? I wonder about that. When Carter was president, my first home buying — I was a first-time home buyer — the rate was 13.33%. I’ll never forget it, and that was a first-time homeowner!RUSH: I know. I know.CALLER: That was a deal!RUSH: I know. I know.CALLER: That was a deal at 13.33%!RUSH: I bought my first shack, you know, at that time in Overland Park, Kansas. I had no business buying it. But everybody said, “You gotta buy! Don’t rent. You’re throwing money away if you rent.”CALLER: Mmm-hmm.RUSH: So, you know, my one time I became a conformist, it got me. I didn’t want to live in this shack! I never wanted to move into this shack. But it’s what I bought, so I had to move into the thing.CALLER: And one more.RUSH: I didn’t even want people to take me home. I didn’t want people to see this shack that I lived in. One day, we’re playing football — the Chiefs front office, the Royals front office — after the baseball season. Thursday afternoon flag football. George Brett’s playing and he offered to take me home. I said (chuckles), “No, George, I’m fine.” I didn’t want Brett to see where the shack was. So, yeah, 13% interest rates during Carter, and it was bad. Carter actually coined the term “malaise” to describe his own administration and its effect on the American economy!We had “the misery index” and all of that.But look, back to the coronavirus for just a second. That is true that the Hong Kong protests strangely subsided as the news of the coronavirus expanded — and I’ll tell you, it is a way. If you are a totalitarian government and you need to control your population, one of the best ways of doing it is unleashing something they think is a deadly disease and then you, as the dictator, have the “safety solutions.” You have the ability to round people up from their homes and take ’em to so-called health camps.Be very leery of this, folks.It probably is not what the media’s leading you to believe it is.\n",

      "I live in China. This year, like every other, people with severely compromised immune systems were and are suffering from pneumonia. In early January 2020, in Wuhan, China – a place with dreadful air quality—hospitals started receiving patients.In fact, for most of November, all of December, and most of January, the air quality index (AQI) was so bad that local governments regularly issued standard health warnings due to high levels of particulate matter. (At my school in Shanghai, if the AQI is over 150, children are cannot play outside. This is based on government advisories.) And please be aware, far from hiding the problem, government officials in China at the regional and national level, readily provide daily and historical reports of the air quality index, noting particulate matter (PM2.5) and more. Thus we can track data for Wuhan — and most other large cities and urban areas — for the past six years.Unsurprisingly, those diagnosed with severe forms of COVID-19 are the elderly and immunocompromised. Additionally, people who have a host of pre-existing conditions are at higher risk. (NEJM March 30th, 2020). The Boston-based non-profit, Health Effects Institute, says anywhere from 500000 to 1250000 Chinese die due to air pollution alone each year. (see pages 11-13). But the question this report discusses is, “When people have pneumonia or other respiratory difficulties, what are the best treatment protocols?”Ceep it Cimple Ctupid: Intravenous Vitamin C … Again?All across China, not just in Wuhan, but also in other cities that saw pneumonia cases (and note, Chinese medical teams discuss COVID-19 as pneumonia), people are being cured with vitamin C.I am including the details from a public report written in Chinese and published by a medical team Xibei Hospital, affiliated with Jiao Tong University, in the city of Xi’an, Shaanxi province. (To complete the translation I used a combination of programs and resources:  Google Translate, Pleco, and Baidu Fanyi).Given what the doctors in Xi’an knew of reports from Wuhan (which is 500 miles away from Xi’an, in the neighboring province of Hubei), and from seeing pneumonia patients in early February 2020, a team at the Xibei Hospital, devised a protocol centered on the use of intravenous (IV) vitamin C against the Coronavirus. They first treated patients on February 10th. Critically ill patients received 200 mg of soluble vitamin C per kg body weight, once every 12 hours. After the first two treatments, the patient would get 100 mg/kg, every 24 hours, for the next four days. (Those presenting with moderate symptoms were given 100 mg/kg on day one).Arguably, these doses are too low. Practitioners and researchers like Dr. Suzanne Humphries (2014) and Thomas Levy, J.D., Ph.D. (2017), posit that intravenous infusions of vitamin C should be from 50-100g per day, and can be repeated every 3-7 days.The Xibei Protocol.Using the Xibei protocol, a person weighing 70 kg (154 pounds), would receive a total of 28 grams of vitamin C on the first day. Thereafter, they would receive 7 g per day. The clinical trial in Wuhan gave similar doses. On February 14th, 2020, the university hospital started giving pneumonia patients a non-body weight-dependent dose of 12 g of vitamin C every 12 hours for seven days.Even with their relatively low doses, patients in Xi’an were released after four to eight days of vitamin C. Thus, the protocol, emphasizing the antioxidant, ascorbic acid, has been a clear success.Nevertheless, my question is, Why don’t we hear of anything about intravenous vitamin C as a routine practice in the United States, or even in other developed countries with reported COVID19 cases like Italy, Spain, Germany, France, or Iran?What Does the Research Say about Vitamin C?The teams in China did not choose to administer vitamin C due to mere guesswork. To make the decision, they cited the medical literature and used their knowledge about respiratory diseases and oxidative stress.Dr. Zhi Yong Peng, at the Zhongnan Hospital, at Wuhan University, justified his decision to use vitamin C, noting:For most viral infections, there is a lack of effective antiviral drugs … Vitamin C, ascorbic acid, has antioxidant properties. Clinical studies have shown that vitamin C can effectively prevent [sepsis and related cytokine storms]. In addition, vitamin C can [protect the lungs].Vitamin C can effectively shorten the duration of (or even prevent) the common cold. In a controlled … trial, 85% of 252 students experienced a reduction in [cold] symptoms, [after receiving] high-dose vitamin C group (1g per hour for 6 hours, followed by 1g every 8 hours).Xibei Report on Vitamin C. According to the Xibei Hospital (2020) report:For patients with severe neonatal pneumonia and critically ill patients, vitamin C treatments should be initiated as soon as possible after admission. This is because whether the illness was similiar to infections seen in the past like Keshan disease, SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), or the current new [COVID19] pneumonia, the main cause of death of patients is cardiopulmonary failure caused by increased acute oxidative stress. When the virus causes increased oxidative stress in the body and increased capillary permeability, early application of large doses of vitamin C can have a strong antioxidant effect, reduce inflammatory responses, and improve endothelial (heart tissue) function.They add:Numerous studies have shown that treatment with doses of vitamin C promote excellent results. Our past experience in successfully rescuing acute Keshan disease and current studies at home and abroad show that high-dose vitamin C can not only improve viral resistance, but more importantly, can prevent and treat acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress (ARDS).Why not nutrition?Dr. Thomas Levy has written many books and has given many lectures on the benefits of vitamin C for curing disease and body detoxification. Of course, Levy attributes this information great pioneer Frederick Klenner, MD. Klenner used ascorbic acid and developed protocols with intravenous and intramuscular applications of high dose vitamin C. He was published as early as 1949—reporting cures of polio, measles, mumps, chickenpox and more.Because I knew of the benefits of high dose vitamin C in early February, I encouraged four ex-pat doctors, working in Wenzhou, China, to give it to their patients. Wenzhou, a city of over 10 million, was the second Chinese city placed under a complete quarantine. These doctors ridiculed me and scoffed at the idea that nutrition could provide any relief to coronavirus patients. One actually said: “A vaccine is the only solution, as a virus has no effective treatment.” I voiced my objection to that idea, and had plans to use the antiviral drugs — then being touted by the WHO.Again, I insisted that antioxidants could save the sick. To this, the M.D. added: “Nutrition is important, but if nutrition is enough, why do governments make hospitals and medical colleges?”Why, indeed.What about Selenium?When I read the press release and protocol from Jiao Tong University Hospital, I wanted to learn more about Keshan disease. That rabbit hole only introduced me to more evidence that confirmed how nutrition can cure. Below are some excerpts from the Wikipedia entry on Keshan disease:Keshan disease, named after Keshan County of Heilongjiang province in Northeast China, is a congestive cardiomyopathy caused by a combination of dietary deficiency of selenium and the presence of a mutated [sic] strain of Coxsackievirus [sic] … Often fatal, the disease afflicts children and women of child-bearing age. It is characterized by heart failure and pulmonary edema.After reading all the references cited by the Wiki page, I concluded the following about Keshan disease and the state of scientific knowledge. Symptoms of respiratory difficulty and congestive heart disease were found to be prevalent in a wide belt of territory extending from northeast to southwest China (including parts of Shaanxi province. (See Ge and Yang 1979); those areas which are replete with selenium-deficient soils.(b) The research holds that Keshan disease peaked from 1960–1970, when thousands died of the disease. And during that decade, China experienced a man-made famine. Then followed by food shortages, especially in rural parts of China.(c) Intentional dietary supplementation with selenium reduced the incidence and harm of Keshan disease in China. (See Ge and Yang 1979).Keshan Disease.Beck et al. (2003) cited a 1979 report from China. The report declared, unequivocally: “Populations living in areas of China with selenium-rich soils did not develop Keshan disease.”Given their interest, Beck et al. (2003) conducted research into the role of selenium and Keshan disease. They concluded.“[Experiments with mice] suggest that together with the deficiency in selenium, an infection with coxsackievirus was required for the development of Keshan disease.”Please appreciate the idea that viruses cause disease is not universally accepted—and arguably wrong for Keshan disease in particular. Ge and Yang (1979) claimed that Keshan disease was and is not related to any virus. Instead, they note it as seasonal – coming in the winter. Ge and Yang (1979) explored the question of a viral cause for Keshan disease but rejected that hypothesis due to a lack of evidence. Though most medical practitioners insist that viruses cause disease, recall that in 2005, Peter Doshi discovered that despite claims that influenza virus kills thousands of Americans every year, for 2001, America had only 18 confirmed flu deaths.\n",
      "The lack of evidence for a viral infection causing Keshan disease and the failure to find a flu virus in fatalities attributed to a virus should guide our thinking about COVID-19 today. Remember, the Chinese doctors in Xi’an treat pneumonia as pneumonia. And they lump together different viruses (SARS, MERS, etc.), saying that each causes oxidative stress.Oxidative Stress.If disease—all disease—is really about oxidative stress, as Dr. Thomas Levy holds, maybe the type of virus is irrelevant. Keep in mind, even though virologists categorize many types of viruses, there are no true species of viruses (Racaniello 2019, Lecture #1, minutes 56-57).To determine whether selenium deficiency was a specific link to the coxsackievirus, Beck et al. (2003) injected the influenza virus into selenium-deficient mice and mice fed with adequate amounts of selenium. As we should expect, the selenium-deficient mice had more severe pathology, more inflammatory distress, and produced more T-cells, antibodies, and hormones when they developed the respiratory infection.Consider that the viruses associated with pneumonia and other types of respiratory distress are different. In human populations, we generally see respiratory ailments with flu-like symptoms, and/or pneumonia, during the winter months. Additionally, we see respiratory illness in persons depleted of an essential antioxidant, selenium. That is, they are suffering from oxidative stress when exposed to the pathogen.Deficiency in Cuba.Going back to Beck et al. (2003), because their investigation into Keshan disease attributed the ailment to both selenium deficiency and a virus [sic], the team wanted to bolster their thesis with a case study. They provided some discussion about the relationship between said virus and selenium, in another part of the world—Cuba.During a period of severe nutritional deficit in Cuba (1989-1993), doctors found a rash of patients developing optic and peripheral neuropathy (Beck et al. 2003). The Cuban doctors discovered that their sick patients had oxidative stress due to selenium deficiency, and 84% had some mutated form of coxsackievirus. And the outbreaks occurred in the winter months when vitamin D3 blood-levels would be lowest (Beck et al. 2003).Just putting these few sources together, we know that:people get sick in winter. a virus is not essential to the formation of an illness or disease.More significantly, neither specific viruses nor any distinct diseases have a link to selenium deficiency. Selenium is an antioxidant. And when we raise our antioxidant levels and reduce oxidative stress, we can stay infection-free. Ergo, the key to beating or avoiding pneumonia, a cold, the flu, or any respiratory ailment, is to consume adequate amounts of selenium and vitamin C.Other important nutrients to take as supplements are vitamins A, E, and K, B-complex, magnesium, and zinc.Conquer COVID Craziness—and Encourage Others Too. The last time I took a class at a university was spring 2001. Since that time, I’ve been enjoying the benefits of my virtual university—the Internet. Over the last 20 years, I have heard lectures from professors and researchers on radio, podcasts, and YouTube. We now have access to millions of peer-reviewed articles, books, and historical accounts. I studied the best that our information age can offer. I learn from Drs. Viera Scheibner, Gary Null, Sherri Tenpenny, Thomas Levy, Rashid Buttar, Sherry Rogers, Nick Gonzales, Leonard Coldwell, Linus Pauling, Fred Klenner, Toni Bark, William Kelley, and many more.But I have not just absorbed their information, I have used their work as a jumping-off point to do further research … and you can too.The allopaths either do not know or do not care about nutrition (just ask Allan Smith). There is a general awareness of the intellectual laziness of American physicians. I have observed this after interactions with Western-trained doctors from South Africa, India, and the Middle East, the arrogance of their ignorance is endemic.From my survey of the current news, if you are in America or Europe, all you hear is that the best doctors can offer is hydroxychloroquine, antivirals or a future vaccine. But from the research, we can see that, instead of their pharmaceutical drugs (which can mask symptoms, but do not cure), what we all need is selenium-rich food (or whole food supplements) and high doses of vitamin C.Can We Get Back To Normalcy?There will always be people with viruses and respiratory difficulties. They will be suffering from oxidative stress—and that is NOT contagious. The numbers will rise in the winter when there is less sun. Less sun lowers vitamin D3 levels and reduces the absorption of phosphorous. Additionally, people are more likely to eat more starchy foods and get less vitamin C in their diet.This is why we hear of members of Congress, professional athletes in NBA, NHL, and world-class soccer players testing positive for COVID. These people were not in China, not eating bat soup, and not sharing ventilators with older people in Italian ICU wards. They did not contract an exogenous virus—their bodies made the virus due to oxidative stress. In fact, spontaneous endogenous generation of viruses, referred to by some as exosomes, would explain why Beck et al. (2003) discovered mutated and more virulent strains of the coxsackievirus in their selenium-depleted mice. They also discovered these strains in human subjects with low selenium. This also notes why researchers are forever finding new and mutated versions of viruses.Regardless, as Del Bigtree (2020) showed from the European data (minutes 80-90), in the winter of 2018, death rates across Europe were far higher than today—but there was no declaration of an epidemic or pandemic, and there was no global shut down.No Fear of the Unknown. This is not a time to accept economic stagnation and the social dislocation that will accompany it. It is not a time to fear that which you cannot see (a virus)—especially given that no medical doctor has ever proven that said viruses cause illness. (I will present more on the virus theory in future articles).Get your Vitamin C, selenium, and zinc, wash your hands to prevent bacterial infection and tell your friends to do the same.China Cures Coronavirus with Vitamin C; Research Suggests Selenium\n",

      "The entire cover-up is allegedly backed by globalist billionaire George Soros. Such allegations have been dismissed by the mainstream media and China as a conspiracy theory, saying California-based Gilead owns the patent for remdesivir. But, Gilead itself was reported as saying if it uses its own drug, it would get into legal trouble with China.China reportedly holds part of the remdesivir patent through the UN agency Unitaid, whose main donor since 2006 is the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Separately, the Clinton Foundation also worked with Unitaid on the 100-million-dollar project to study HIV/AIDS in the past. Unitaid also has offices near the Chinese bio-weapons lab in Wuhan, which top Republicans suspect was funded by none other than Dr. Anthony Fauci and the NIH.That was fooling around with this virus. Despite that, Dr. Fauci gave $3.7 million to the Wuhan laboratory. We paid for it. We paid for the damn virus that's killing us.This is not about COVID or about a virus.

      "On January 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the “coronavirus outbreak (to be) a public health emergency of international concern.”On Sunday, US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci said the coronavirus “almost certainly is going to be a pandemic.”The WHO defines a pandemic as a “worldwide spread of a new disease.”The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) calls it “a disease that spreads across several countries or continents, usually affecting a large number of people.”Britain’s Health and Safety Executive says a viral outbreak can be characterized as a pandemic if it’s “markedly different from recently circulating strains,” notably if “humans have little or no immunity” to it.The New York Times quoted former CDC director Thomas Frieden, saying it’s “increasingly unlikely (that the coronavirus) can be contained,” adding:“It is therefore likely that it will spread, as flu and other organisms do, but we still don’t know how far, wide, or deadly it will be.”The term pandemic applies to a disease that affects large numbers of people worldwide — clearly not applicable to the coronavirus outbreak based on evidence so far. See below.According to Mayo Clinic’s Dr. Pritish Tosh “In epidemiologic terms, an outbreak refers to a number of cases that exceeds what would be expected.”“A pandemic is when there is an outbreak that affects most of the world.”“We use the term endemic when there is an infection within a geographic location that is existing perpetually.”An epidemic refers to an infectious disease outbreak in a particular country or community.How do the above definitions apply to the coronavirus outbreak in China?Here are the latest numbers through Monday: 20622 confirmed cases, 426 dead in China, the outbreak mostly in Wuhan and surrounding areas.Cases in other countries aren’t anywhere near epidemic or pandemic levels. Judge for yourself:Australia – 12, mostly individuals who returned from Wuhan or Hubei province. Cambodia – 1. Canada – 4. Finland – 1. France – 6. Germany – 10. India – 3. Italy – 2. Japan — 20. Malaysia – 8 (all Chinese nationals). Nepal – 1. The Philippines – 2. Russia – 2. Singapore – 18. South Korea – 15. Spain – 1. Sri Lanka – 1. Sweden – 1. Taiwan – 10. Thailand – 19. UAE – 5. UK – 2. US – 11. Vietnam – 8. Most of the above cases apply to Chinese nationals or individuals who returned from the country, in most or all cases from Wuhan.In response to a question asked me by a friend on the seriousness of the coronavirus outbreak to people in the US, I explained that the chance of being in an auto accident or harmed by one at home is far greater.I also stressed that establishment media, especially US cable channels, are the most unreliable sources of information on the coronavirus outbreak, featuring fear-mongering reports.Some examples include:The New York Times: “Beijing Sees ‘Major Test’ as Doors to China Close and Coronavirus Deaths Surpass SARS”. The Washington Post: “States scramble to carry out Trump’s coronavirus travel order”. The Wall Street Journal: “Coronavirus Closes China to the World, Straining Global Economy”. Fox News: “Experts worry about pandemic as coronavirus numbers increase”.CNN: “Wuhan coronavirus: Confirmed cases top 20000 as China marks deadliest day”.Other establishment media headlined reports are similar.According to the CDC, at least 15 million flu illnesses have been reported so far during the 2019 – 20 season, resulting in 140000 hospitalizations and 8200 deaths in the US.These numbers reflect a national epidemic. Yet little about this is reported — other than annual recommendations to get flu shots, sponsored by Big Pharma.Natural News calls them “the greatest medical fraud in the history of the world.” Why?Because they “contain over 50 ppm mercury, an extremely toxic heavy metal linked to kidney failure, birth defects, spontaneous abortions and neurological damage.”The same goes for other vaccines, potentially more dangerous than diseases they’re meant to protect against.They’re a bonanza for Big Pharma. On February 1, CNBC reported that “(i)nvestors (are) rush(ing) into biotechs (that are) working on coronavirus vaccine(s).”A dozen or more companies are working on developing them, clinical testing to begin in a few months, the profit potential huge. When approved for sale, they’ll be marketed worldwide, advertising promoting them.On Monday, Natural News reported that the coronavirus was “engineered by scientists in a lab using well documented genetic engineering vectors that leave behind a ‘fingerprint,’ ” adding:“(T)he WHO and CDC are covering up this inconvenient fact.”Law Professor Francis Boyle drafted the US Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989 — signed into law by GHW Bush, revoked by Bush/Cheney on the pretext of rebuilding America’s defenses at a time when the nation’s only enemies are invented. No real ones exist.Boyle believes the potentially deadly coronavirus is a biowarfare weapon, genetically modified for this purpose.China’s Wuhan BSL-4 lab is a WHO-designated research lab, Boyle explaining that the organization is fully aware of what’s happening and how.Boyle’s assessment contradicts claims about the virus originating from a Wuhan seafood market or being connected to coronaviruses found in bats.Indian Institute of Technology scientists “discovered that the Wuhan coronavirus has been engineered with AIDS like insertions” — meaning it’s not a naturally occurring phenomenon if true, adding:It’s “quite unlikely for a virus to have acquired such unique insertions naturally in a short duration of time.”China is using AIDS drugs to treat infected patients. China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention is working on developing a vaccine.In 2003, media spread fear-mongering about a SARS pandemic proved way overblown, 800 deaths reported after hysteria subsided.In the same year, 42643 people in the US were killed in 6328000 police-reported motor vehicle accidents, 2889000 people injured.In 2009, the WHO falsely predicted a global Swine flu H1N1 pandemic that could affect “as many as two billion people over the next two years.”At the time, evidence suggested that the H1N1 strain was bioengineered in a US laboratory, vaccines produced for it extremely hazardous and potentially lethal.\n",
      "No national or global emergency existed. No pandemic or epidemic occurred. The CDC estimated that from 8330 to 17160 deaths resulted from the strain.\n",
      "Fear-mongering at the time aimed to convince people to take experimental, untested, toxic and extremely dangerous vaccines that can damage the human immune system and cause health problems ranging from annoying to life-threatening.A similar scenario is in play today. Vaccines could be rushed to market, Big Pharma promoting their use.The US had an active biological warfare program since at least the 1940s.In 1941, it implemented a secret program to develop offensive and allegedly defensive bioweapons using controversial testing methods.During WW II, the US Chemical Warfare Services began mustard gas experiments on about 4000 servicemen.In 1945, the US Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) implemented “Program F.”It was the most extensive US study of the health effects of fluoride – a key chemical component in atomic bomb production.It’s one of the most toxic chemicals known, risking harm to the central nervous system.Yet low concentration amounts are in drinking water and toothpaste, little or nothing reported officially or by establishment media on its toxicity.Since at least the 1940s, VA patients were guinea pigs for medical experiments.The Pentagon earlier released biological agents in US cities to learn the effects of germ warfare in populated areas, tests done secretly.In 1953, the CIA initiated Project MKULTRA – a multi-year research program to test drugs and biological agents for mind control and behavior modification, unwitting human subjects used.From the 1960s at least through the 1980s, the US used biological agents against Cuba.During the Vietnam War, the Pentagon’s use of hugely toxic Agent Orange and sarin nerve gas killed, disabled, or caused chronic illnesses for millions, mainly civilians.In all US wars, radiological, chemical, biological and other banned weapons are used, inflicting a devastating toll on people in targeted areas.Is the coronavirus a bioweapon as Francis Boyle believes? Most likely, it’ll be contained in the weeks ahead, reported numbers of individuals infected falling, not rising.When all is said and done, ongoing fear-mongering will likely prove to be a bonanza for Big Pharma.As for the coronavirus, it may end up a footnote in medical history — thousands affected in China, not millions, mainly in and around Wuhan, small numbers elsewhere.Is coronavirus a US biowarfare weapon as Francis Boyle believes?\n",

      "Confirming the reports from small independent studies and 3 clinical trials, a Shanghai hospital has announced a recommendation to use high dose intravenous treatment of vitamin C to treat COVID-19, according to the Orthomolecular Medicine News Service. The announced official recommendation that COVID-19 should be treated with high doses of intravenous vitamin C come as welcomed news as the virus continues to spread. The dosage recommendation will vary with the severity of illness ranging from 50-200 milligrams per kilogram body weight per day to as much as 16000 mg/kg/day.Note: \"Using Vitamin C\" was added to the title on April, 13, 2020. The doses are ranging from approximately 4000 to 16000 mgs for an adult which is administered by an IV. Atsuo Yanagisawa, MD, PhD who is President of the Japanese College of Intravenous Therapy states that this specific method of administration is very important because vitamin C’s effects are at least 10 times more powerful when taken by IV rather than orally, and that “Intravenous vitamin C is a safe, effective, and broad-spectrum antiviral.”Richard Z. Cheng, MD, PhD is the associate director for the clinical trials. We are proud to say that Dr. Cheng is a Fellow and board certified anti-aging physician by the American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine (A4M) as well as being a Fellow and board certified A4M Integrative Cancer Therapy.  Dr. Cheng has been working closely with medical and government authorities through China and has been instrumental in facilitating at least 3 of the clinical IV vitamin C studies in China. Despite most of his work being sensored and blocked by most media Dr. Cheng has been trying to bring this information to the public and will continue his efforts to encourage more hospitals to implement IV vitamin C therapy along with high doses of oral vitamin C as well. Additionally, both Dr. Cheng and Dr. Yanagisawa recommend oral vitamin C for prevention of COVID-19. Comments from Dr. Cheng in February reads:“Vitamin C is very promising for prevention, and especially important to treat dying patients when there is no better treatment. Over 2000 people have died of the COIV-19 outbreak and yet I have not seen or heard large dose intravenous vitamin C being used in any of the cases. The current sole focus on vaccine and specific antiviral drugs for epidemics is misplaced.”“Early and sufficiently large doses of intravenous vitamin C are critical. Vitamin C is not only a prototypical antioxidant, but also involved in virus killing and prevention of viral replication. The significance of large dose intravenous vitamin C is not just at antiviral level. It is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that kills most people from coronaviral pandemics (SARS, MERS and now NCP). ARDS is a common final pathway leading to death.The official statement from Xi’an Jiaotong University Second Hospital reads: “On the afternoon of February 20, 2020, another 4 patients with severe new coronaviral pneumonia recovered from the C10 West Ward of Tongji Hospital. In the past 8 patients have been discharged from hospital. . . [H]igh-dose vitamin C achieved good results in clinical applications. We believe that for patients with severe neonatal pneumonia and critically ill patients, vitamin C treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after admission. . .[E]arly application of large doses of vitamin C can have a strong antioxidant effect, reduce inflammatory responses, and improve endothelial function. . . Numerous studies have shown that the dose of vitamin C has a lot to do with the effect of treatment. . . [H]gh-dose vitamin C can not only improve antiviral levels, but more importantly, can prevent and treat acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress (ARDS).”The protocol from the Chinese government can be read here, they are not blocking this news. Then why are we not hearing more about this on the news when you can find it published online in many places, it does make one wonder. But this can be corrected at any time by people sharing the news, we have included various links that will take you to the information including the clinical trials. To be blunt not sharing or withholding information from the public of potential treatments should be seen as negligence. Vitamin C is not new, it is available, and has been proven and used as an antiviral since the 1930s(1). Vitamin C has been injected at high doses since the 1940s(2), and has been used for influenza, SARS, and viral pneumonia in the decades since then(3). “At my hospital in Daegu, South Korea, all inpatients and all staff members have been using vitamin C orally since last week. Some people this week had a mild fever, headaches and coughs, and those who had symptoms got 30000 mg intravenous vitamin C. Some people got better after about two days, and most had symptoms go away after one injection.” (Hyoungjoo Shin, M.D.)“We need to broadcast a message worldwide very quickly: Vitamin C (small or large dose) does no harm to people and is the one of the few, if not the only, agent that has a chance to prevent us from getting, and can treat, COVID-19 infection. When can we, medical doctors and scientists, put patients’ lives first?” (Richard Z. Cheng, MD, PhD, International Vitamin C China Epidemic Medical Support Team Leader).“We therefore call for a worldwide discussion and debate on this topic,” says Dr. Cheng.Official Statement From China For Recommended Treatment Of COVID-19 Using Vitamin C\n",

      "RECOMBINATION technology has been in use in molecular virology since the 1980’s. The structure of the 2019-NCoV virus genome provides a very strong clue on the likely origin of the virus.Unlike other related coronaviruses, the 2019-nCoV virus has a unique sequence about 1378 bp (nucleotide base pairs) long that is not found in related coronaviruses.Looking at the phylogenetic tree recently published derived using all the full genome sequence, we see the 2019-nCoV virus does not have clear monophyletic support given the bootstrap value of 75 (Fig 1).Close-up on Bootstrap value of 75 for available 2019-nCoV from Lu et al., 2020 The Lancet article [Full Text]\n",
      "There is no doubt that there is a novel sequence in 2019-nCoV; we confirmed this via sequence alignment. Here’s the DOT plot:The gap in the line shows a lack of sequence homology beween the most similar bat coronavirus and 2019-nCoV. The inserted sequence, which should not be there is here:A database search by the first team to study and publish the whole genome sequence for the origins of the inserted sequence turned up no hits (Ji et al., 2020). They conducted a codon-bias analysis which led them to speculate that perhaps there had been a recombination event between a coronavirus in snakes with a coronavirus from bats (Ji et al., 2020).This led to criticism on Wired(3) with quote dismissing the snake origin hypothesis as lacking evidence. There is, however, clear evidence that the novel sequence, which I will refer to henceforth as INS1378, is from a laboratory-induced recombination event. Specifically, The sequence similarity to other coronavirus sequences is lower to its most similar sequences in any coronavirus than the rest of the genome (IPAK finding)\n",
      "(2) The high sequence similarity of INS1378 to a SARS spike protein (2; IPAK Confirmed). We also found significant sequence similarity of INS1378 to a pShuttle-SN vector that was in use in the 1980’s in China to create a more immunogenic coronavirus (IPAK finding, details below, Option 4).Here, I review four Option on the origins of the 2019-nCoV Coronavirus isolated from human patients from Wuhan, China.Option 1. Natural coronavirus related to bat coronaviruses, Not a Recombined Virus.Evidence for: Phylogenetic clustering with Bat coronaviruses.Evidence against: Low bootstrap support (N=75) and presence of a INS1378.Status: Falsified hypothesis.Test: Survey coronviruses in animals in the wild.Option 2. A recombined virus that naturally picked up a SARS-like spike protein in it N-terminus (3′ end) of the viral genome.Evidence for: The INS1378 codon bias similar to snakes ($). Evidence against: Insufficient match in database search to other known CoV spike proteins (Ji et al., 2020). Status: Speculative hypothesis. Unlikely.Test: Find an isolate that matches 2019-nCoV in the wild and reproducibly independently isolate the virus from a wild animal (a match will confirm).Option 3. A recombined virus made in a laboratory for the purpose of creating a bioweapon.Both China and the US hinted at the other side’s potential liability in playing a role in bringing about a novel coronavirus in the lab specifically for the purpose of being used as a bioweapon. To add to the intrigue, a Chinese Scientist was released from BSL-4 laboratory in Manitoba, Canada for violating protocols, allegedly sending samples of deadly viruses to mainland China.On January 26, The Washington Times published this article citing an Israeli defense expert claiming that China has likely proceeded with a bioweapons program, but ending the article with a quote to London’s Daily Mail from a US scientist Rutgers University microbiologist Richard Ebright that “at this point there’s no reason to harbor suspicions” that the lab may be linked to the virus outbreak.The pShuttle-SN vector was among many described in a 1998 paper by Bert Vogelstein et al; here is a company where one can purchase the pShuttle-SN vector:It turns out that the sequence from pShuttle is most closely related to the Spike protein from SARS coronavirus.This particular technology was used in 2008 to attempt to develop a more immunogenic vaccine against coronavirus. Here’s a Chinese patent for that technique and product intended for use in a vaccine.The patent summary reads. SARS vaccine of adenovirus vector and preparation method, application of coronavirus S gene. Abstract. The present invention belongs to the field of genetic engineering, particularly relates to adenoviral vector SARS vaccines, their preparation and coronavirus S genes in SARS (SARS) on vaccines for the prophylaxis. By means of biological engineering, the coronavirus S gene in combination with deficient recombinant adenovirus, the protective immunogen protein or polypeptide expressed therein, through expansion culture, purification, and formulation to prepare a mucosal immunogenicity can cause the gene vaccine, respiratory mucosal immune response induced by the body to produce antibodies against the virus infection. Specific conditions of the present invention, compared with conventional inactivated virus particle vaccine, safe, easy to use, without limitation intramuscular, have broad clinical applications.In 2015, The US called for an end to research creating new viruses in the lab that have increased threat (higher transmissibility, higher pathogenicity, higher lethalithy). The very researchers conducting studies on SARS vaccines have cautioned repeatedly against human trials;\n",
      "“An early concern for application of a SARS-CoV vaccine was the experience with other coronavirus infections which induced enhanced disease and immunopathology in animals when challenged with infectious virus [31], a concern reinforced by the report that animals given an alum adjuvanted SARS vaccine and subsequently challenged with SARS-CoV exhibited an immunopathologic lung reaction reminiscent of that described for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in infants and in animal models given RSV vaccine and challenged naturally (infants) or artificially (animals) with RSV [32], [33]. We and others described a similar immunopathologic reaction in mice vaccinated with a SARS-CoV vaccine and subsequently challenged with SARS-CoV [18], [20], [21], [28]. It has been proposed that the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV is the antigen to which the immunopathologic reaction is directed [18], [21]. Thus, concern for proceeding to humans with candidate SARS-CoV vaccines emerged from these various observations.” – Tseng et al.,\n",
      "The disease progression in of 2019-nCoV is consistent with those seen in animals and humans vaccinated against SARS and then challenged with re-infection. Thus, the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV is an experimental vaccine type must be seriously considered.Evidence for: Sequence homology between INS1378 to pShuttle Coronavirus vaccine; presence of a SARS-like Spike protein in bat coronavirus, otherwise most similar to bat coronaviruses; low bootstrap value.Evidence against: Low sequence homology (but highly signifiant). NB these viruses are RNA viruses and they can evolve quickly, even under laboratory conditions.Status: Most likely.Test: Determine the nucleotide sequence all laboratory types of coronavirus being studied in China (a match will confirm). Find an isolate that matches 2019-nCoV in the wild and reproducibly independently isolate the virus from a wild animal (a match will falsify).\n",
      "The available evidence most strongly supports that the 2019-NCoV virus is a vaccine strain of coronavirus either accidentally released from a laboratory accident, perhaps a laboratory researcher becoming infected with the virus while conducting animal experiments, or the Chinese were performing clinical studies of a Coronavirus vaccine in humans.Dr. Dale Brown brought to my attention the studies that have reported serious immunopathology in animals – rats, ferrets, and monkeys – in which animals vaccinated against coronoviruses tended to have extremely high rates of respiratory failure upon subsequent exposure in the study when challenged with the wild-type coronavirus.“Caution in proceeding to application of a SARS-CoV vaccine in humans is indicated”- Te et al., 2012 [Full Text]\n",
      "Yasui et al., (2012) reported severe pneumonia in mice who were vaccinated against SARS who were subsequently infected with SARS.\n",
      "Another study of a double-inactived SARS vaccine found increased eosinophilic proinflammatory responses in vaccinated mice, especially older mice, writing:\n",
      "“Importantly, aged animals displayed increased eosinophilic immune pathology in the lungs and were not protected against significant virus replication.”\n",
      "If the Chinese government has been conducting human trials against SARS. MERS, or other coronviruses using recombined viruses, they may have made their citizens far more susceptible to acute respiratory distress syndrome upon infection with 2019-nCoV coronavirus.\n",
      "The implications are clear: if China sensitized their population via a SARS vaccine, and this escaped from a lab, the rest of world has a serious humanitarian urgency to help China, but may not expect as serious an epidemic as might otherwise be expected.\n",
      "In the worst-case scenario, if the vaccination strain is more highly contagious and lethal, 2019-nCoV could become the worst example of vaccine-derived contagious disease in human history. With an uncharacteristic aysmptomatic prodromal period of 5-7 days, individuals returning from China to other countries must be forthright and cooperative in their now-prescribed 2-week quarantine.On the Origins of the 2019-nCoV Virus, Wuhan, China\n",

      "Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province in China, was chosen to be China’s first 5G “smart city” and the location of China’s first smart 5G highway. Wuhan is also the center of the horrendous coronavirus epidemic. The possible linkage between these two events was first discussed in an Oct. 31, 2019 article entitled: “Wuhan was the province where 5G was rolled out, now the center of deadly virus” https://5g-emf.com/wuhan-was-the-province-where-5g-was-rolled-out-now-the-center-of-deadly-virus. The question that is being raised here is not whether 5G is responsible for the virus, but rather whether 5G radiation, acting via VGCC activation may be exacerbating the viral replication or the spread or lethality of the disease.  Let’s backtrack and look at the recent history of 5G in Wuhan in order to get some perspective on those questions.  An Asia Times article, dated Feb. 12, 2019 (https://www.asiatimes.com/2019/02/article/china-to-launch-first-5g-smart-highway) stated that there were 31 different 5G base stations (that is antennae) in Wuhan at the end of 2018. There were plans developed later such that approximately 10000 5G antennae would be in place at the end of 2019, with most of those being on 5G LED smart street lamps.  The first such smart street lamp was put in place on May 14, 2019 (www.china.org.cn/china/2019-05/14/content_74783676.htm), but large numbers only started being put in place in October, 2019, such that there was a furious pace of such placement in the last 2 ½ months of 2019.  These findings show that the rapid pace of the coronavirus epidemic developed at least roughly as the number of 5G antennae became extraordinarily high.  So we have this finding that China’s 1st 5G smart city and smart highway is the epicenter of this epidemic and this finding that the epidemic only became rapidly more severe as the numbers of 5G antennae skyrocketed.Are these findings coincidental or does 5G have some causal role in exacerbating the coronavirus epidemic?  In order to answer that question, we need to determine whether the downstream effects of VGCC activation exacerbate the viral replication, the effects of viral infection, especially those that have roles in the spread of the virus and also the mechanism by which this coronavirus causes death.Accordingly, the replication of the viral RNA is stimulated by oxidative stress:J Mol Biol. 2008 Nov 28;383(5):1081-96.   Variable oligomerization modes in coronavirus non-structural protein 9.  Ponnusamy R, Moll R, Weimar T, Mesters JR, Hilgenfeld R.Other aspects of viral replication including those involved in the spread of the virus are stimulated by increased intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i, oxidative stress, NF-kappaB elevation, inflammation and apoptosis, each of which are increased following EMF exposure.  The first citation below shows an important role of VGCC activation in stimulating coronavirus infection.The predominant cause of death from this coronavirus is pneumonia.  Pneumonia is greatly exacerbated by each of those five downstream effects of VGCC activation, excessive intracellular calcium, oxidative stress, NF-kappaB elevation, inflammation and apoptosis. The first of the citations listed below shows that calcium channel blockers, the same type of drugs that block EMF effects, are useful in the treatment of pneumonia.  This predicts that EMFs, acting via VGCC activation, will produce increasingly severe pneumonia and therefore 5G radiation as well as other types of EMFs may well increase pneumonia deaths.These all argue that 5G radiation is likely to greatly exacerbate the spread of the coronavirus and to greatly increase the lethality of the infections produced by it.  The good news is that it is likely that those of us that live in areas with no 5G radiation and who avoid other EMFs wherever possible will probably escape much of the impacts of this prospective global pandemic.  It is highly probable that one of the best things Wuhan can do to control the epidemic in the city is to turn off the 4G/5G system.Role of 5G in the Coronavirus Epidemic in Wuhan China\n",

      "Rep. Guy Reschenthaler (R-PA) said this weekend that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi would rather investigate President Donald Trump again than focus on the actual origins of the Chinese coronavirus and U.S. tax dollars that went to the Wuhan Institute of Virology from which intelligence officials increasingly believe the virus leaked.Appearing on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel, Reschenthaler discussed his efforts to investigate tax dollars that flowed through a New York firm to the Wuhan lab. He said that Pelosi and House Democrats are not interested in holding the Chinese Communist Party accountable and, instead, want to focus their oversight efforts on politically harming President Trump again just like they tried and failed with the partisan impeachment last year and earlier this year.“We should have an investigative body looking at these grants, but Nancy Pelosi is not going to do that,” Reschenthaler said. “So you have myself and House Republicans. I can tell you I’m going to continue to look into these grants. I’m going to continue to look into the Department of Homeland Security as well to see what grants are going from there to China. I’m also looking at defunding the World Health Organization and we can talk about that as well. But the bottom line of the Democrats’ behavior is this: They hate this president so badly that they would rather side with the Chinese Communist Party than defend Americans and defend our spending and spend wisely and just be honest. That is their hatred for President Trump and disdain for President Trump’s supporters.”Reschenthaler wrote a letter this week to Secretary of Defense Mark Esper inquiring about a Pentagon grant to EcoHealth Alliance, Inc., a New York firm that has had a history of funding the Wuhan Institute of Virology with subgrants from American taxpayers. The Pentagon grant the congressman was inquiring about was for research into bat-borne zoonotic diseases and their potential as weapons of mass destruction or biological weapons. While it is unclear if that grant saw U.S. taxpayer money flowing from it out to the Wuhan lab, it is known that another grant that EcoHealth Alliance received did partially spend U.S. tax dollars in the Chinese lab.That grant, from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) — in particular the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which is run by the now-famous Dr. Anthony Fauci — saw U.S. tax dollars sent to EcoHealth Alliance for researching coronaviruses from bats flow out to the Chinese lab in Wuhan. Some of the money went to other labs around the world too, an NIH official confirmed to Breitbart News last week. But the NIH was so concerned about the money and this lab in Wuhan that the government notified EcoHealth Alliance that it would be investigating the matter and that any funds to the Wuhan lab must be halted while the investigation occurred.The NIH funded EcoHealth Alliance, which then, in turn, turned around and partially funded the Wuhan Institute of Virology,” Reschenthaler told Breitbart News. “The DOD also gave EcoHealth Alliance $6.5 million in a grant, and like you said, that grant was to understand bat-borne zoonotic disease in context with weapons of mass destruction. So what I’m trying to find out is whether or not the DOD funding that went to EcoHealth also went to the Wuhan Institute of Virology. We know that the NIH funding did, and we also know that all money is fungible, but I want to see if we can trace that money to Wuhan to see how much and to what extent the DOD and American taxpayers actually funded the Wuhan Institute of Virology.Deep State In Effort To hide their Dirt plans to Block Investigation into Chinese Coronavirus Origins, Tax Money to Wuhan Lab\n",

Opting out of vaccinations should not be an option based on some leading medical experts.On Tuesday, Maine’s voters will be asked in a referendum if it’s acceptable to allow parents to send their unvaccinated children.Measles vaccination becomes mandatory in Germany.Parents in Germany must vaccinate their children against measles or face substantial fines, according to a new law that takes effect this month.The controversial new regulation was approved last year after the country recorded more than 500 cases of the disease.Germany's Minister of Health, Jens Spahn, said education about the importance of vaccination was not enough.Parents must provide proof of immunisation. Religious Vaccine Exemption Bills Spark Debate Across the United States. A recent Pew Research Center study found that more than 88% of adults support requiring healthy children to receive vaccines in order to attend school to avoid the potential risk to others.However, ongoing legislative efforts to remove religious exemptions from vaccinations have led to protests by anti-vaccination advocates.A bill known as SB3668 has been put before the state Senate to refrain from vaccinating their children on religious grounds. The legislation would additionally remove most medical exemptions for vaccines that are required to attend school.Virginia bill would add more required vaccines for students.A bill in Virginia could add more required vaccines for students.Right now, the Virginia Department of Health requires nine vaccinations. However, that number could grow to 13.The bill would require Virginia students to receive every vaccine that the CDC recommends for children.Maine’s stricter law on vaccination requirements up for a vote.When Maine’s voters head to the polls in the presidential primaries Tuesday, they also will cast a vote on an issue many physicians wish had never been politicized — a referendum to overturn a new law that would allow unvaccinated children to attend school only if they have received a waiver from a medical professional.The new law, which would take effect in September 2021, aims to boost immunization among school-age children in a state where just over 5 percent of kindergartners are unvaccinated not only for medical reasons but because of their parents’ religious or philosophical beliefs. That puts Maine below the 95 percent threshold that public health officials say is necessary to stop the spread of preventable and sometimes deadly diseases like the measles.Misinformation campaigns have raised fears about the alleged dangers of immunization, which extensive research has shown are unwarranted.Global vaccine coalition unveils ambitious plan to immunize 300 million children.Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, has unveiled an ambitious plan to expand the number of doses it helps developing countries purchase, aiming to vaccinate an additional 300 million children from 2021 to 2025.The Geneva-based organization revealed to donors it needs $7.4 billion for its five-year period at an event in Japan on Friday (local time) to launch its replenishment drive.Gavi CEO Dr. Seth Berkley said several other major global health programs — the Global Polio Eradication Initiative and the Global Fund to Fight HIV, Tuberculosis and Malaria among them — are also undertaking funding drives.Vatican’s Academy for Life encourages parents to vaccinate children. Bill Gates reveals his family attends Catholic church. Vatican urged to partner with top population controllers on pope’s Global Education Pact. American economist and population control proponent Jeffrey Sachs has announced that potential funding partners for Pope Francis’s May 2020 Global Education Pact to create a “new humanism” include U.S. billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates.

      "The uneven spread of the novel coronavirus around the world was clustered in several hot pockets while leaving other areas with scant outbreaks. This pattern developed in China, with the epicenter of Wuhan City in Hubei province owning, at one time, more than 99% of the cases and deaths over the rest of the country of 1.4 billion people.Outside the mainland, Taiwan and Hong Kong have not experienced the runaway infections or deaths that China did, with the latter twice experiencing the restart of last year’s protests. Although the coronavirus spread fast in South Korea and Japan in the beginning, both outbreaks were extinguished.In South Korea, the vectors for two of the country’s four clusters came from a Wuhan branch of a cult church and a Catholic church pilgrimage returning from Israel. Since then, South Korea has moved aggressively to defuse new clusters by radically testing people and disinfecting mass transit systems daily. With more than 9100 cases and 126 deaths, and with one-third recovered, Korea has fewer cases and deaths than New York City. Today, South Korea also boasts the fewest number of new coronavirus cases, according to the BBC.Japan took a different route with the novel virus. Japan has only 1200 cases and 130 deaths. A total of 712 infections came from one supercluster in the Diamond Princess cruise ship, docked in Yokohama. That’s more than half of the entire country.The International Olympic Committee recently canceled the Tokyo Summer Olympics. The cancellation isn’t due to the outbreak in Japan, but likely from so many nations battling the virus.The New Epicenter of Northern Italy.In March, the COVID-19 outbreak shifted from China to Northern Italy. Soon after, the entire nation of 60 million was placed under strict quarantine. Social distancing turned into permission slips to leave one’s home. Despite the containment efforts, the virus hit Italy very hard. It emptied streets, stopped life as Italians knew it while killing more than 7500 people out of 75000 total infected.On the first weekend of spring, images emerged from Italy, showing similar scenes of horror. Scenes that were eerily reminiscent of Wuhan: people walking down the street, collapsing dead without any external force. Dozens of such videos and photos showed the fallen people spread eagle, flat on their backs, face down on sidewalks. Lifeless. No blood splatter. Outside of one similar case in New York City, no other place in the world has produced such anomalies.Why?What causes people, who appear to be fit, to keel over without a seizure or to tremble suddenly? What is the underlying cause? And what makes Wuhan and Northern Italy different than other parts of the world? So different that COVID-19 kills people with no apparent explanation?Why Wuhan?In 2018, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology selected Wuhan as a pilot city for the “Made in China 2025” plan. The overarching goal aimed at the industrial city of 11 million to become the world’s Internet of Things mecca. The goal? A 5G smart city that would connect homes, offices, hospitals, factories, and autonomous vehicles via a digital fabric.Renowned for its factories and severe pollution, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) envisioned elevating Wuhan as the global smart city of the future. All of the commands, controls, data sharing, and data flowing through artificial intelligence systems would showcase China as the preeminent digital leader of the world.\n",
      "At the center of the plan, the Chinese telecom syndicate of ZTE, Huawei, Hubei Mobile, and China Unicom began to transform Wuhan into a giant 5G “hot spot” for wireless technology. The 5G launch in the Hubei capital city culminated with the October 2019 Military World Games. Wuhan activated 20% of its 10000 5G base stations, and the rest by the end of the year. With the hottest 5G pilot city on the planet, the CCP planned to leverage the publicity to attract more foreign investment and lure international businesses to prop up China’s flagging economy.Then disaster struck.A New Pneumonia.In mid-December, just six weeks after the military games concluded, the first cases of a new pneumonia started to show up in area hospitals. Over 72 hours through New Year’s day, scientists decoded the novel virus. On January 2, Wuhan notified the CCP and the Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) about the outbreak. The two governing bodies of the Peoples Republic of China took precautions for their leaders, personnel, and buildings. Instead of telling the world about the outbreak, the regime kept it under tight control. Three weeks after sequencing the virus, Xi Jinping finally made his first public comment about the discovery of COVID-19 and the epidemic ravaging Wuhan.By then, the epidemic erupted out of control. Millions became infected, and tens of thousands in Hubei died. These numbers far exceeded the “official” numbers claimed by the CCP and supported by the World Health Organization (WHO).At its height, many leaked videos showed people falling, collapsing, or sprawled dead in the streets of Wuhan. Nowhere else in the infected areas of China did similar scenes show that type of death.Then a clinical study comparing “Imported cases of COVID-19 in Jiangsu Province,” by Jian Wu, et al., discovered a key finding between Wuhan and Jiangsu patients.“Compared with the cases in Wuhan, the cases in Jiangsu exhibited mild or moderate symptoms and no obvious gender susceptivity. The proportion of patients having liver dysfunction and abnormal CT imaging was relatively lower than that of Wuhan.”So, what was the underlying cofactor that separated Wuhan from all other areas in China? And what was the factor that was making the virus more virulent?Body Bags.While the WHO praised China’s response to the outbreak, only in Wuhan did the police weld infected people in their apartments to die. Only in Wuhan did they burn bodies beyond the capacity of the crematoriums. Only in Wuhan did the regime receive accusations of burying the dead in body bags under cover of the night.In looking for a cofactor, several outlets suggest Wuhan’s acute pollution was to blame for the virus’ death toll. Others theorized that a vaccine trial “primed” a subset of citizens, making them more vulnerable to COVID-19. In the former, there are many other cities in Asia as polluted that didn’t experience the same corona clusters. While in the latter, no new vaccine trials were launched in Wuhan in 2019.5G Microwave Effects at 60GHz. In 2001, Shigeaki Hakusui, then president of Harmonix Corporation, explained why fifth-generation wireless technology was needed to reach the goal of creating smart cities. He said it would require bandwidth and efficiency to meet the data demand as the Internet moved toward mobile technology. That was two decades ago.Hakusui noted that 60GHz was the true radiofrequency that would allow for reliable transmission of data, due to its “98 percent oxygen absorption” rate. This allows the invisible signals to travel from point A and B, and back again on the same path. Super-efficient and a technological milestone.Hakusui writes:Since the presence of O2 is fairly consistent at ground level, its effect on 60GHz radio propagation is easily modeled for margin budgeting purposes. Also, the high level of attenuation from oxygen absorption makes even the worst weather-related attenuation insignificant, especially on the short paths where 60GHz systems operate.He stated, unequivocally, that 60GHz would deliver the last mile efficiently, as the “oxygen absorption makes possible the same-frequency reuse within a very localized region of air space.”The downside to 5G, however, is the lack of biological safety and health tests to support its global rollout. Even workers who installed 5G towers are burning them down. Does the electrification of the entire planet make sense? Do thousands of satellites being deployed where infrastructure doesn’t exist, such as the oceans make sense?Unsettling Results.Testing 5G by trial and error has already produced some unsettling results. They include the mass deaths of birds in the Netherlands, the cutting down of half of Sheffield, England’s trees, and strange illness clusters of children in some U.S. schools.Most people don’t grasp or care that their WiFi can send signals through drywall, glass, and concrete slabs, just the same as beams go through the human body. And with 5G a far more focused beam, those signals have no trouble traveling through a person.The problem is for every breath we breathe, our blood transports oxygen throughout the core, extremities, to the vital organs, heart, and brain.If 5G at 60 GHz frequency zips through the air, absorbing most of the oxygen, disrupting the electrons that bind 02 molecules that, combined with a hydrogen atom, form water vapor, what is that frequency doing to blood cells, which consist primarily of water and carry the oxygen?Do the disruption of the body’s biorhythm, breathing, and oxygen distribution begin to explain what happens to the people who dropped dead?Mt. Everest “Death Zone”.Studies of acute mountain sickness show that as climbers ascend in altitude, they hit an endurance wall from a lack of oxygen. “At 4500 m [14764 feet], the real amount of oxygen in the air composition is only 12% diluted, which is approximately 60% of sea-level oxygen,” according to Brazilian scientists, who published a paper last year.Higher up the mountain in the “death zone” of Mt. Everest, climbers die due to severe hyperbaric hypoxia, even with bottled oxygen as their blood coagulates. In another view, altitude sickness starves the brain of oxygen.That does stack up and explains the unusual scenes of Wuhan citizens dying literally in the streets. They keel over dead, not shaking from a heart attack or seizure, never resuscitated.Milan in Northern Italy is the 5G capital of Europe. Iran, where suspected millions have been infected, has installed 5G deployments. And sure enough, the three Princess line cruise ships—Diamond, Grand, and now Ruby—had GEO and MEO satellites beaming 5G down to the ships as they travel via a Medallion Net receiver system last autumn.Although South Korea is a wirelessly connected nation, it doesn’t have the number of cases like other places in the world that does. Yet, its third and fourth coronavirus clusters were in 5G-hot gymnasium and hospital.As the anomalous deaths of people in Wuhan and Italy can attest, society, the telecom industry, and government are long past due to study the health effects of 5G, especially at the “unlicensed” 60GHz frequency.Is 5G a Deadly Trigger for the Coronavirus?\n",

      "How Vitamin C Reduces Severity and Deaths from Serious Viral Respiratory Diseases. Most deaths from coronavirus are caused by pneumonia. Vitamin C has been known, for over 80 years, to greatly benefit pneumonia patients.In 1936 Gander and Niederberger found that vitamin C lowered fever and reduced pain in pneumonia patients.Also in 1936, Hochwald independently reported similar results. He gave 500 mg of vitamin C every ninety minutes.McCormick gave 1000 mg vitamin C intravenously, followed by 500 mg orally every hour. He repeated the injection at least once. On the fourth day, his patient felt so well that he voluntarily resumed work, with no adverse effects.In 1944 Slotkin and Fletcher reported on the prophylactic and therapeutic value of vitamin C in bronchopneumonia, lung abscess, and purulent bronchitis. \"Vitamin C has greatly alleviated this condition and promptly restored normal pulmonary function.\"Slotkin further reported that \"Vitamin C has been used routinely by the general surgeons in the Millard Fillmore Hospital, Buffalo, as a prophylactic against pneumonia, with complete disappearance of this complication.\"According to the US Centers for Disease Control, there are about 80000 dead from annual influenzas, escalating to pneumonia, in the USA. Coronavirus is a very serious contagious disease. But contagion to a virus largely depends on the susceptibility of the host. It is well established that low vitamin C levels increase susceptibility to viruses.Vitamin C lowers mortality. It is one thing to be sick from a virus and another thing entirely to die from a viral-instigated disease. It must be emphasized that a mere 200 mg of vitamin C/day resulted in an 80% decrease in deaths among severely ill, hospitalized respiratory disease patients.A single, cheap, big-box discount store vitamin C tablet will provide more than twice the amount used in the study above.And yes, with vitamin C, more is better.Frederick R. Klenner and Robert F. Cathcart successfully treated influenza and pneumonia with very high doses of vitamin C. Klenner published on his results beginning in the 1940s; [8] Cathcart beginning in the 1970s. They used both oral and intravenous administration.\"Vitamin C is effective in reducing duration of severe pneumonia in children less than five years of age. Oxygen saturation was improved in less than one day.\"A recent placebo controlled study concluded that \"vitamin C should be included in treatment protocol of children with pneumonia so that mortality and morbidity can be reduced.\" In this study, the majority of the children were infants under one year of age. By body weight, the modest 200 mg dose given, to tiny babies, would actually be the equivalent of 2000-3000 mg/day for an adult.Although many will rightly maintain that the dose should be high, even a low supplemental amount of vitamin C saves lives.

      "A left wing Harvard professor was charged this month with spying for the Chinese Government. Charles Lieber taught at Harvard University in Boston. he was arrested and after being arraigned in Boston federal court, released on $1 million bail. His arrest is a result of his dealings with the Chinese government.\n",
      "He has not explicitly been charged with espionage yet. But he has been charged with lying to federal department of defense investigators on his dealings with the Chinese Government.lieber was the chairman of Harvard’s chemistry department, so his arrest has sent shockwaves through the academic community. Lieber received secret payments of $50000 a month, plus bonuses, to help China setup a chemical research lab in Wuhan, China. Wuhan is where the new coronavirus plague began. The Harvard-WUT Nano Key Lab was established by Lieber in Wuhan. In April, 2018 he was approached by FBI investigators who asked him about the Wuhan research lab. He said he was unfamiliar with it, and had never been asked for anything by the Chinese government. This was a lie though, and he now faces federal charges. Wuhan is ironically where the coronvirus broke out at. It’s now infected over 75000 people worldwide. Israeli intelligence officials came out publicly to accuse China of biologically creating the virus.Virus outbreak grows. The Coronavirus continues to spread, and it seems now that containing it is not an option. There’s a number of reasons for this. The virus has a long incubation period. It’s being found out now that many people can go infected without even realizing it for a number of days or weeks. The virus also seems to stay with people or come back even after someone has been infected. Because of this, people an walk around infecting others without even realizing it for weeks. The other problem is that it is apparently highly contagious. It doesn’t take much contact to get someone infected. People are becoming sick in places where they don’t even have a record of coming in contact with an infected.It’s been speculated that the Coronavirus was created at a lab in Wuhan. Ironically, China’s only biological research lab for handling weaponized viruses is in Wuhan, China. Recently a professor from the United States who specializes is viral research was charged by the federal government with lying about his work at the laboratory. All signs point to a fact that says the virus was man made.It’s also been exposed in media that the lab there in Wuhan has gotten in trouble before for selling animals that had been experimented on to local markets. An illegal way to make extra cash. Regardless if this is the cause of the outbreak or not, this shows the security lapses at the facility. The virus will not cause mass death. But it will cause mass economic hardship. Putting large numbers of people out of work will have crippling effects on the economy. And this may have been the intended effect all along.Bernie wants to remove the healthcare system defeating Coronavirus. America is in the middle of an important election this year. And the stakes have turned deadly. We’re faced with a possible pandemic, not see on earth in over a century. And we need strong leadership to face it.Bernie is looking to be the nominee for the Democrats. Him being President would be disastrous. Senator Sanders spent a good portion of his life as what some may call a loser. Could not keep a job, could never pay rent, always had his utilities turned off. And this was during the 60s and 70s when things were much more affordable. In fact, he lived his life as a revolutionary drifter up until 39. Then he found a way to get paid for being lazy.

Since then, Bernie has been both a Burlington mayor and a vermont Senator. He hasn’t done anything but vocally voice support for communist dictators in the 80s and 90s..he also visited the Soviet Union where he was recorded singing communist songs naked and drunk.Bernie doesn’t have the skills to manage the government during a viral pandemic. He can’t even answer basic questions on how he’s going to pay for all the free programs he wants the government to do. How is he supposed to handle a crisis like this? And on top of it, he wants to take away America’s private healthcare in the middle of an outbreak. So far, American healthcare is vastly outperforming the universal socialist healthcare systems Bernie wants to implement. In Iran and Italy, both countries with Socialist healthcare, fatality rates are the highest in the world now, at 11%. Italy is at 3%, much lower than Iran, but still high. Meanwhile in the United States, the mortality rate is 0%. Every person in the US sick with Coronavirus has made a full recovery. So why would Bernie want to take this healthcare away? Sanders was never taken serious until the past two or three weeks. Now he’s being seen as the front runner for the Democrats and potential nominee. Time will tell if he’ll actually be it. But if he is, then America will have to decide if it wants to take such a deadly risk in electing him. liberal media contributes to panic. Across the globe, the media spreads panic about the Coronavirus. But it’s fatality rate is small. If you are already healthy, your chances of dying are slim to none. And for the United States, we’re leading the globe in recovery. While other countries struggle to contain the virus and treat infected, the US already has a whopping 100% recovery rate. Meanwhile, countries with socialist healthcare systems are facing brutal fatality rates, like those in Iran and Italy.And for treatment, while the rest of the world panics and prepares for quarantine, in the United States there’s already been multiple vaccines developed.Here’s the latest statistics on the virus as it spreads.total infected- 83379. total recovered- 36525.recovery rate- 93%. active cases- 43996, serious cases- 8099. expected to recover- 35897. total dead- 2835. Total fatality rate in children under 9- 0%. total fatality rate in those over 80- 14%. 10.5% fatality rate if patient has cardiovascular disease. 7.3% for diabetes. 6.3% for chronic respiratory disease. 6% for hypertension. 5.6% for cancer. 0% fatality rate if the patient is in the United States.2-4% if in China.Overall outside of china, the fatality rate is 0.7%.Liberal Harvard Professor May Have Been Behind Coronavirus\n",

      "Now that the state and its media have falsely characterized the coronavirus as a pandemic closing in on the 1918 flu pandemic (falsely attributed to Spain), it is time for the global elite and their technocrats to force not only highly-profitable (for Big Pharma) vaccines on the world but biometric IDs as well. “As countries begin to lift coronavirus lockdowns, biometric identification can help verify those who have already had the infection, and ensure that the vulnerable get the vaccine when it is launched, health and technology experts said,” reports Reuters. A biometric ID system can keep a record of [the infected] and those getting the vaccine, said Larry Dohrs, Southeast Asia head at iRespond, a Seattle-based nonprofit that launched its technology last month.The pretense for this—as it was for the US decimation of Libya, Syria, and Iraq—is “humanitarianism,” according to iRespond and Simprints, a British NGO partnered with Johns Hopkins University’s Global mHealth Initiative, the latter connected to the US military and its “Dark Winter” and “Event 201” pandemic scenarios (see Whitney Webb: All Roads Lead to Dark Winter). Total surveillance requires 24/7 monitoring of individuals—especially those included in the Main Core database of activists and political enemies of the state—and biometric technology introduced during the hysteria of an exaggerated health threat fits the bill. President Vladimir Putin: Who Armed the Terrorists in Syria? Who Created the Islamic State (ISIS).ID2020—a project initiated by the Rockefeller Foundation, Bill Gates and Microsoft, transnational pharmaceutical corporations, and technology firms—is pushing the concept that every human on the planet needs biometric verification because “to prove who you are is a fundamental and universal human right,” according to the ID2020 website. “What they really want is a fully standardized data collection and retrieval format, and cross-border sharing of identities of the entire population of the planet, in order for the stand-alone AI-powered command center to work without a hitch, and for purposes of calculating everyone’s potential contribution, and threat to the system,” explains OffGrid Healthcare. If you believe this is dangerously close to China’s “social credit” system, you’re not far off the mark.Introducing this totalitarian technology under the cover of a supposed pandemic rife with speculation and a dearth of hard numbers is a near-perfect cover for “patient ID technology” producing data on individuals shared with the state and its corporate partners. A vaccine ostensibly designed to combat COVID-19 will become mandatory and those who resist will be blacklisted as public health criminals. They will be locked out of society, similar to Chinese citizens suffering under China’s totalitarian social credit system. Martin Armstrong believes the healthcare-industrial complex and the state will surreptitiously introduce a nanotech ID and tracking chip along with a cocktail of vaccine toxins, or they will sell it to the public as a way to identify those presumably infected.The proposal is a digital certificate that verifies if you have been vaccinated and was developed by MIT and Microsoft. They are looking at merging this with Bill Gates’ ID2020. It is entirely possible that this scare has been a deliberate plot to get people to accept these digital implants. Refuse, and you will be prohibited from social gatherings. Like 9/11 conditioned us to be x-rayed before entering a plane, now the next stage is to embed digital markers that they have been using in dogs and cats.COVID-19 is the perfect Trojan horse for a control freak state itching to not only micromanage the lives of ordinary citizens but also ferret out critics and potential adversaries and punish them as enemies of the state. The latter is the primary objective. History is replete with examples—from Stalin and Mao to Hitler and Mussolini, with lesser autocrats and dictators along the way.

      "Vaccines, for Bill Gates, are a strategic philanthropy that feed his many vaccine-related businesses (including Microsoft’s ambition to control a global vaccination ID enterprise) and give him dictatorial control of global health policy.Gates’ obsession with vaccines seems to be fueled by a conviction to save the world with technology.Promising his share of $450 million of $1.2 billion to eradicate Polio, Gates took control of India’s National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization which mandated up to 50 doses (Table 1) of polio vaccines through overlapping immunization programs to children before the age of five. Indian doctors blame the Gates campaign for a devastating non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP) epidemic that paralyzed 490000 children beyond expected rates between 2000 and 2017. In 2017, the Indian government dialed back Gates’ vaccine regimen and asked Gates and his vaccine policies to leave India. NPAFP rates dropped precipitously.In 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) reluctantly admitted that the global explosion in polio is predominantly vaccine strain. The most frightening epidemics in Congo, Afghanistan, and the Philippines, are all linked to vaccines. In fact, by 2018, 70% of global polio cases were vaccine strain.The CDC has a large financial interest in pushing untested vaccines on the public and WHO is even more under the control of Big Pharma. The organization is corrupt beyond the meaning of the word. “The WHO is a sock puppet for the pharmaceutical industry.During Gates’ 2002 MenAfriVac campaign in Sub-Saharan Africa, Gates’ operatives forcibly vaccinated thousands of African children against meningitis. Approximately 50 of the 500 children vaccinated developed paralysis.\n",
      "South African newspapers complained, “We are guinea pigs for the drug makers.” Nelson Mandela’s former Senior Economist, Professor Patrick Bond, describes Gates’ philanthropic practices as “ruthless and immoral.”In 2010, the Gates Foundation funded a phase 3 trial of GSK’s experimental malaria vaccine, killing 151 African infants and causing serious adverse effects including paralysis, seizure, and febrile convulsions to 1048 of the 5949 children.In 2010, Gates committed $10 billion to the WHO saying, “We must make this the decade of vaccines.”A month later, Gates said in a Ted Talk that new vaccines “could reduce population”.In 2014, Kenya’s Catholic Doctors Association accused the WHO of chemically sterilizing millions of unwilling Kenyan women with a  “tetanus” vaccine campaign. Independent labs found a sterility formula in every vaccine tested. After denying the charges, WHO finally admitted it had been developing the sterility vaccines for over a decade.  Similar accusations came from Tanzania, Nicaragua, Mexico, and the Philippines.In 2014, the Gates Foundation funded tests of experimental HPV vaccines, developed by Glaxo Smith Kline (GSK) and Merck, on 23000 young girls in remote Indian provinces. Approximately 1200 suffered severe side effects, including autoimmune and fertility disorders. Seven died. Indian government investigations charged that Gates-funded researchers committed pervasive ethical violations: pressuring vulnerable village girls into the trial, bullying parents, forging consent forms, and refusing medical care to the injured girls. The case is now in the country’s Supreme Court.A 2017 study (Morgenson et. al. 2017) showed that WHO’s popular DTP vaccine is killing more African children than the diseases it prevents. DTP-vaccinated girls suffered 10x the death rate of children who had not yet received the vaccine. WHO has refused to recall the lethal vaccine which it forces upon tens of millions of African children annually.Global public health advocates around the world accuse Gates of steering WHO’s agenda away from the projects that are proven to curb infectious diseases: clean water, hygiene, nutrition, and economic development.The Gates Foundation only spends about $650 million of its $5 billion dollar budget on these areas. They say he has diverted agency resources to serve his personal philosophy that good health only comes in a syringe.In addition to using his philanthropy to control WHO, UNICEF, GAVI, and PATH, Gates funds a private pharmaceutical company that manufactures vaccines, and additionally is donating $50 million to 12 pharmaceutical companies to speed up development of a coronavirus vaccine.In his recent media appearances, Gates appears confident that the Covid-19 crisis will now give him the opportunity to force his dictatorial vaccine programs on American children.Robert F Kennedy Jr. Exposes Bill Gates' Vaccine Agenda In Scathing Report\n",

      "Viral online posts claiming 5G is causing coronavirus are absolutely wrong. Conspiracy theorists are taking them seriously, however, and some are turning violent. Here's why their arguments are nonsense.The false, superstitious belief that 5G cellular networks are somehow causing a global health crisis has found a new conspiracy theory: the idea that the global coronavirus pandemic is caused by 5G. It is not.Since I originally wrote this, 5G conspiracy theories have turned violent. Anti-5G conspiracy theories have fueled 5G tower arson attacks. According to The Guardian, they're driven largely by viral Facebook posts, often from groups mixing in anti-Semitic slurs and conspiracy theories about 9/11. The New York Times suggests a Russian-backed propaganda campaign is in part to blame.\n",
      "A petition on Change.org claiming that \"60 megahertz waves\" would \"suck the oxygen out of our lungs\" (it won't) got more than 114000 signatures before it was deleted. In the US, the conspiracy theories were prominently promoted by Keri Hilson, an R&B singer who for some reason has 4.2 million Twitter followers and 2.3 million Instagram followers. She has since deleted the tweet (\"Management has asked me to delete vid/articles,\" she wrote in a follow-up tweet) but apparently got it from someone with 839000 Instagram followers going by \"chakabars,\" from a completely random chiropractor named Gloriane Giovanelli, and from the Wikipedia quick-fact snippet appearing on a search for \"Who invented 5G?'\"Hilson's most striking source is a completely insane video, which she posted to her Instagram, where a man with his name tag turned backwards claims that the 1918 flu pandemic was caused by the invention of radio, some undescribed pandemic during World War II was caused by \"Radar fields,\" and a 1968 flu in Hong Kong was caused by \"satellites emitting radioactive frequencies.\"\"In the last six months, with the electrification of the Earth … it's called 5G,\" the unnamed man says, going on to spout more utter word salad, including \"the first completely blanketed 5G city in the world was … Wuhan, China.\"Hilson is not the only celeb to spread 5G coronavirus nonsense on social media. As the Times notes, John Cusack and Woody Harrelson have done the same.The Truth About 5G.5G isn't a new, higher frequency. It's just an encoding standard, which can work on many kinds of airwaves. In the UK and China, 5G operates on a band that's sandwiched between existing 4G networks and 5GHz Wi-Fi. That band is extremely similar to current LTE bands in behavior, and it is lower-frequency than the band used for high-speed Wi-Fi since 2009.Most of the 5G out there—including the 5G used in the UK—is just a slightly different way of encoding data on airwaves that are no higher-frequency than those used by Wi-Fi, and no lower-frequency than those used by televisions. Here in the US, most of the \"5G\" you see is just a slightly different form of encoding on airwaves that have been used for nearly 100 years. T-Mobile's low-band 5G is on old UHF TV channels. UHF TV did not cause coronavirus. AT&T's low-band 5G is on cellular frequencies used since 1983, and it is no more powerful. Sprint's 5G is on 4G frequencies that have been used since 2007.Yes, some new, higher frequencies—called millimeter-wave (mmWave)—are being used in the US (not the UK), but they have almost no coverage right now, much as Verizon's marketing would like you to think otherwise. Even though you probably have never encountered it, because it has almost no coverage, mmWave 5G has been certified as safe by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection. The technology has been studied for several years now, with the only negative effects detected being a slight heating effect at power levels far above what the FCC permits any transmitter to operate at. Citywide 5G was also available in the US and the UK before it was available in China. While China did indeed launch 5G in 50 cities on Nov. 1, UK carrier EE launched 5G last May, and Sprint launched broad-coverage 5G in nine US cities last summer (which we covered.) The US and UK have been \"blanketed\" with 5G for months longer than China has.COVID-19 is spreading in places that do not have 5G. Iran, a major hotspot, does not have 5G. Malaysia, another hotspot, does not have 5G. And so on. There is no correlation between increased spread and the presence of 5G. Italy has 5G and the virus went wild; Iran does not, and the virus went wild.\n",
      "Debunking That Dumb UK Petition. The specific Change.org argument in the UK seems to be related to a recent news story about the 60GHz band (not MHz) being approved late last year for unlicensed 5G use in Europe. But that band was approved for, and has been used for, unlicensed networking technologies since 2009. The only new move was to add one encoding standard to the list of existing standards available at 60GHz.No 5G network is currently using 60GHz or has plans to do so in the near future. But 60GHz networks have also existed for quite some time with no damage to anyone. The \"Soli\" feature in the Google Pixel 4 uses 60GHz. The frequency is the basis of the WiGig file-transfer technology, which has appeared in some laptops and phones since 2016. And 60GHz has been used as a metro-area internet backhaul transmission frequency for a decade now in places like Courtenay, BC. If there was an inherent problem with 60GHz, it would have shown up in one of those applications, but it hasn't.Stay safe, folks. Stay inside.

      "The New York Times reported on 30 March that President Trump retreated from his earlier statement that by 12 April the COVID-19 lock-down should be over and its “back-to-work” time. Instead he said that an extension to the end of April was necessary – and possibly even to June. This, he said, was following the guidance of his advisors, of whom Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), within the National Institute for Health (NIH), is one.Virus COVID-19 has so far caused far less infections and death than the common flu in past years. WHO reports on 30 March worldwide 750000 infections with a death toll of 36000. In the US about 161000 cases and 3000 deaths. Yet, alarmist Fauci claims that there may be millions of US coronavirus cases and 100000- 200000 deaths. And, coincidentally, so does Bill Gates, using pretty much the same figures.All with the idea of pushing a vaccine down the throat of the public.A multibillion dollar vaccine is not necessary.The NIAD and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation are collaborating with a view to developing a COVID-19 Vaccine.China has proven that COVID-19 could be brought under control at rather low-cost and with strict discipline and conventional medication. The same medicines and measures have been used for centuries to prevent and cure successfully all kinds of viral diseases.First, a vaccine against COVID-19, or coronaviruses in general, is a flu vaccine. Vaccines don’t heal. In the best case, flu-vaccines may prevent the virus from affecting a patient as hard as it might without a vaccine. The effectiveness of flu vaccines is generally assessed as between 20% and 50%. Vaccines are foremost a huge money-making bonanza for Big Pharma.Second, here are a myriad of remedies that have proven very successful. See also this and this.COVID-19: More Hydroxychloroquine Data From France.French Professor Didier Raoult, who is one of the world’s top 5 scientists on communicable diseases, suggested the use of hydroxychloroquine (Chloroquine or Plaquenil), a well-known, simple, and inexpensive drug, also used to fight Malaria, and that has shown efficacy with previous coronaviruses such as SARS.  By mid-February 2020, clinical trials at his institute and in China already confirmed that the drug could reduce the viral load and bring spectacular improvement. Chinese scientists published their first trials on more than 100 patients and announced that the Chinese National Health Commission would recommend Chloroquine in their new guidelines to treat Covid-19.China and Cuba are working together with the use of Interferon Alpha 2B, a highly efficient anti-viral drug developed in Cuba some 39 years, but little known to the world, because of the US imposed embargo on anything from Cuba. Interferon has also proven to be very effective in fighting COVID-19 and is now produced in a joint-venture in China.There is an old natural Indian / Ayurveda medicine, Curcumin, that comes in capsules as C90. It is an anti-inflammatory, antioxidant compound that has been successfully used to treat cancer, infectious diseases and, yes, coronaviruses.\n",
      "Other simple, but effective remedies include the use of heavy doses of Vitamin C, as well as Vitamin D3, or more generally the use of Micronutrients essential to fight infections, include vitamins A, B, C, D, and E.Another remedy that has been used for thousands of years by ancient Chinese, Romans and Egyptians, are Colloidal silver products. They come in forms to be administered as a liquid by mouth, or injected, or applied to the skin. Colloidal silver products are boosting the immune system, fighting bacteria and viruses, and have been used for treating cancer, HIV/AIDS, shingles, herpes, eye ailments, prostatitis – and COVID-19.\n",
      "A simple and inexpensive remedy, to be used in combination with others, is menthol-based “Mentholatum”. It’s used for common flu and cold symptoms. Rubbed on and around the nose, it acts as a disinfectant and prevents germs to enter the respiratory track, including corona viruses.\n",
      "China Is Using Cuba's Interferon Alfa 2B Against Coronavirus.Northern Italy and New Orleans report that an unusual number of patients had to be hospitalized in Intensive Care Units (ICU) and be put 24×7 on a 90%-strength respirator, with some of the patients remaining unresponsive, going into respiratory failure. The reported death rate is about 40%. The condition is called acute respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS. That means the lungs are filled with fluid. When this description of ARDS episodes applies, Dr. Raoult and other medical colleagues recommend COVID-19 patients to “sleep sitting up” until they are cured. This helps drain the liquid out of the lungs. The method has been known to work successfully since it was first documented during the 1918 Spanish Flu epidemic.Finally, Chinese researchers in cooperation with Cuban and Russian scientists are also developing a vaccine which may soon be ready for testing. The vaccine would attempt to address not just one strand of coronaviruses, but the basic coronaviral RNA genome (RNA = Ribonucleic Acid), to be applied as a prevention of new coronavirus mutations. In contrast to the west, working exclusively on profit-motives, the Chinese-Cuban-Russian vaccine would be made available at low cost to the entire world.These alternative cures may not be found on Big Pharma controlled internet. Internet references, if there are any, may advise against their use. At best, they will tell you that these products or methods have not proven effective, and at worst, that they may be harmful. Don’t believe it. None of these products or methods are harmful. Remember, some of them have been used as natural remedies for thousands of years. And remember, China has successfully come to grips with COVID-19, using some of these relatively simple and inexpensive medications.Few doctors are aware of these practical, simple and inexpensive remedies. The media, under pressure from the pharma giants and the compliant government agencies, have been requested to censoring such valuable information. The negligence or failure, to make such easily accessible remedies public knowledge is killing people.The Role of Bill Gates and the Lockdown.Bill Gates may have been one of Trump’s ‘advisors’, suggesting that he should extend the “back-to-work” date to at least end April, and, if Gates has his way, to at least June. That still remains to be seen. Gates is very-very powerful:President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he wants businesses to open by Easter, April 12, to soften the economic impact. … Gates acknowledged Tuesday that self isolation will be “disastrous” for the economy, but “there really is no middle ground.” He suggested a shutdown of six to 10 weeks. (CNBC, March 24, 2020). The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, will drive the mass vaccination effort which is scheduled to be launched in the period after the lockdown.\n",
      "The vaccination association includes, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a semi-NGO, to which NIH / NIAID outsourced oversight of the vaccination program – supported by Bill Gates; GAVI, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization – also a Bill Gates creation, supported by WHO, also amply funded by the Gates Foundation; the World Bank and UNICEF; plus a myriad of pharmaceutical partners. Bill Gates also strongly suggests that travelers must have in their passport a vaccination certificate before embarking on a plane, or entering a country.The program implementation, including a related global electronic identity-program, possibly administered with nano-chips that could be embedded in the vaccine itself, would be overseen by the little-know agency Agenda ID2020 which is also a Bill and Melinda Gates foundation initiative.Bill Gates is also known as a strong proponent of drastic and selective population reduction. Knowing what we know, who would trust any vaccine that carries Bill Gate’s signature. Hope that this evil endeavor will not succeed is omnipresent. We must hope to the end, then the end will never come – and gradually Light will drown DarknessCoronavirus – No Vaccine Is Needed to Cure It\n",

      "The truth about novel coronavirus is starting to trickle its way out of the realm of independent science with new research pointing to strange anomalies in the virus’s genetic structure that suggest it’s more than likely a bioweapon.Published in the online journal bioRxiv, the study found that novel coronavirus contains “key structural proteins” from HIV. Entitled, “Uncanny similarity of unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV spike protein to HIV-1 gp120 and Gag,” the paper identifies four unique insertions in the virus’s spike glycoprotein that aren’t present in any other form of coronavirus, meaning this one is a whole different animal.The paper goes into further specifics about how these inserts do not appear to be natural, concluding that the engineering of novel coronavirus with these unusual gene sequences “is unlikely to be fortuitous in nature,” again pointing to its unnatural origin.Almost nobody knows about this study because the mainstream media is ignoring it and its implications. And independent media outlets like Zero Hedge that have dared to report on it are now being systematically censored from Twitter and other social media platforms for spreading “misinformation.”“Any suggestion that the coronavirus was engineered as a bioweapon had to be immediately eliminated,” writes Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, about the situation.“The prevailing panic by the establishment sought to blame this outbreak on Mother Nature – i.e. bats, snakes, seafood, etc. – rather than the human beings who are playing around with deadly biological weapons that are designed to extinguish human life.”Be sure to watch the below Health Ranger report from Brighteon.com about the coronavirus situation, entitled “Coronavirus is BIOLOGICAL WEAPON system designed to destroy America:”Was the release of novel coronavirus an accident or intentional?Based on the information put forth by Zero Hedge that got the site banned from Twitter, it appears that novel coronavirus is, in fact, a manufactured bioweapon. The question that remains is whether or not it was accidentally or intentionally released.Dr. Peng Zhou, Ph.D., the scientist who Zero Hedge outed for working with deadly viruses at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, very well could have been involved with research on this particular virus that potentially went terribly wrong. Or, it’s possible that it was developed on purpose as a covert bioweapon to unleash havoc on the world.Keep in mind that the aforementioned paper has since been retracted, meaning someone got to the researchers who published it and pressured them to withdraw it, presumably because it contains too much truth.There’s obviously much more to the story than we’re all being told, and yet the corporate media continues to publish lies – or nothing at all – about the true origin of novel coronavirus. We’re all expected to just believe the narrative that bats and snakes at a seafood market caused this, case closed.\n",
      "“No doubt the authors of this particular paper have been sufficiently threatened to revise their conclusions, and an update of their original paper will soon be posted that effectively denounces everything they stated in the original paper,” Adams contends.“The criminal wing of the science establishment strikes again, of course, and this tactic of threatening scientists with loss of funding, being blacklisted or even physically threatened and killed is not unusual at all.”Time will tell if anything becomes of politically incorrect science like this that lets the cat out of the bag, so to speak. It’s apparently too much truth for the general public to handle, so it has to be stifled and buried, at least for now.To keep up with the latest coronavirus news, be sure to check out Pandemic.news.Yes, coronavirus is a BIOWEAPON with gene sequencing that’s only possible if it was genetically modified in a lab\n",

      "As China attempts to contain the spread of a new coronavirus that has left more than 100 people dead, rumors and disinformation have spread amid the scramble for answers.Some of the speculation has centered on a virology institute in Wuhan, the city where the outbreak began. One fringe theory holds that the disaster could be the accidental result of biological weapons research.But in conversations with The Washington Post, experts rejected the idea that the virus could be man-made.“Based on the virus genome and properties there is no indication whatsoever that it was an engineered virus,” said Richard Ebright, a professor of chemical biology at Rutgers University.Tim Trevan, a biological safety expert based in Maryland, said most countries had largely abandoned their bioweapons research after years of work proved fruitless.“The vast majority of new, nasty diseases ... come from nature,” he said.The British newspaper Daily Mail was among the first to suggest the possibility of a link between the newly spreading virus and the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory, reporting last week that the lab, which opened in 2014 and is part of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, had been the subject of safety concerns in the past.A separate article published by the Washington Times, a conservative newspaper in Washington, took the theories a step further, suggesting in a headline that the “Coronavirus may have originated in lab linked to China’s biowarfare program” and pointing to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.The article cited research by Dany Shoham, a former Israeli military intelligence officer, who told The Post he did not want to comment further.Despite little public evidence, the theory has spread widely on social media, to conspiracy theory websites and in some international news outlets.The Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory is a “Cellular Level Biosafety Level 4” facility, which means it has a high level of operational security and is authorized to work on dangerous pathogens, including Ebola.Those entering the level 4 lab use airlocks and protective suits. Waste, and even air, is heavily filtered and cleaned before leaving the facility.Milton Leitenberg, an expert on chemical weapons at the University of Maryland, said he and other analysts around the world had discussed the possibility that weapons development at the Wuhan lab could have led to the coronavirus outbreak in a private email chain but that no one had found convincing evidence to support the theory.“Of course, if they are doing bioweaponry, it is covert,” Leitenberg said in a phone call, but added it was unlikely the Chinese government would use such a facility for production or even research and development of bioweapons.The Wuhan lab is well-known and it is relatively open compared with other Chinese institutes: It has strong ties to the Galveston National Laboratory at the University of Texas Medical Branch and was developed with the aid of French engineers.“Wuhan Institute of Virology is a world-class research institution that does world-class research in virology and immunology,” Ebright said, noting that one specialty of the facility was researching coronaviruses transmitted by bats.Trevan, who was quoted in a 2017 article in Nature that warned of possible risks at the Wuhan facility that was cited by the Daily Mail, said in a phone call to The Post that he was concerned at the time about how to “manage risk in these complex systems when you cannot predict all the ways in which the system could fail.”A former British diplomat and political adviser to the United Nations, he said he had not followed affairs at the facility closely since 2017 and was not aware of any specific problems there, but that he doubted the coronavirus outbreak could have come from a weapons program.An annual State Department report released last year said China had engaged “in biological activities with potential dual-use applications.”Elsa Kania, a fellow at the Center for a New American Security, said that while Chinese officials had expressed public interest in the potential weaponization of biotechnology, a coronavirus would not be a useful weapon.“Hypothetically, a bioweapon would be designed to be highly targeted in its effects, whereas since its outbreak the coronavirus is already on track to become widespread in China and worldwide,” she said.Vipin Narang, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, wrote in a message on Twitter that a good bioweapon “in theory has high lethality but low, not [high], communicability” and that spreading such ideas would be “incredibly irresponsible.”After the 2014 Ebola outbreak, fringe news outlets suggested spuriously that the U.S. Department of Defense had manufactured the virus. In the Soviet Union, military labs did look into whether the virus could be used as a weapon but ultimately abandoned those hopes.The speculation may be linked to uncertainty over where the ongoing novel coronavirus outbreak originated. Some scientists initially suspected a seafood market in Wuhan may have been the starting point, but a study by Chinese researchers and published in the Lancet on Friday questioned that analysis.Late Tuesday, Hu Xijin, editor of the nationalistic Global Times newspaper, wrote that a conspiracy theory had emerged in China that the United States was responsible for the outbreak. “Their logic: Why always China?” Hu wrote on Twitter. “But most Chinese don’t believe it.”Experts debunk fringe theory linking China’s coronavirus to weapons research\n",

      "Is anyone else buying the official dogma? Excuse me, narrative?What we’re seeing, quite clearly, is a totalitarian system subversively imposed on us, step by step.  Yet, like watching a magician who does his tricks right in front of his audience, we can’t see the sleight of hand! First lockdowns happened in Italy and France, causing millions of people to live out a daily nightmare in deep fear – fear of the virus, with isolation being imposed upon them.Today, I’ve just seen major announcements by the UK and South Africa to lockdown those countries (and I am currently in the UK) for an ‘initial’ three weeks.Having watched some compelling evidence that we are going towards an Orwellian state, it’s vital to get the truth out there before we all accept this level of paranoia and fear as ‘normal’.Ask yourself, do you now accept as ‘normal’ the heightened security (military and police presence) and the wearing of masks, social distancing, self-isolation and so on.  To what degree have you internalised this as ‘the way it must be?’The governments and faceless “experts” are making these draconian rules for everybody — AND we sorely need to question what these so-called experts say because they are part of the very system that created and spread the unnecessary fear, just so the system can later do what IT wants without any critical questioning of motive.Looked at with a critical eye, the ensuing panic and madness is helping to cement into our minds a different order of reality.We are being told not to question authority any longer, and the narrative we’ve being fed is a constantly fear-based one, with logic being used to justify the tightening of the proverbial noose around our necks.In today’s speech by the UK Prime Minister, the public has been told they should only leave to go for exercise, shopping for necessities, medical reasons, and travelling to and from work if needed.Weddings and baptisms should not go ahead (can you imagine?). Places of worship, where people find solace together in God or a Higher Power, has been banned as well. From tonight, only supermarkets, convenience stores and pharmacies can be open and people will only be able to leave the house once a day to exercise and once to go to the shops. (Well, at least we can get out, eh?)We are being treated like criminals (‘house arrest’), and the programming is so subversive because no one feels they can can go against it – it is a matter of conscience now.  We will be destroying the NHS, overloading those on the from line!  We will be spreading the virus, and killing each other, and being totally irresponsible – and nobody wants that.Lots of deep programming has now happened since January that has led us to accept ‘our fate’ and we’re not even questioning the fact that these measures are continually destabilising our trust in our own bodies — and, worse, EACH OTHER.The medical system is being made to look like GOD, or at least A SAVIOUR.Do you know anyone who’s genuinely happy?  I don’t… any fleeting happiness is immediately overshadowed.  This is the biggest coup against humanity today, is it not?  And it’s spine-chillingly brilliant.Would a government that truly cared about you be SO controlling?  Remember, in an abusive relationship, the victim often hates what’s being done but stays anyway – and, quite perversely, may love the abuse as a sign of ‘love’.See the correlation?  (Just step back).Here’s an excerpt of the UK PM’s speech:people will only be allowed to leave their home for the following very limited purposes:shopping for basic necessities, as infrequently as possibleone form of exercise a day – for example a run, walk, or cycle – alone or with members of your household; any medical need, to provide care or to help a vulnerable person; and travelling to and from work, but only where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home.That’s all – these are the only reasons you should leave your home.You should not be meeting friends. If your friends ask you to meet, you should say No.You should not be meeting family members who do not live in your home.You should not be going shopping except for essentials like food and medicine — and you should do this as little as you can. And use food delivery services where you can.If you don’t follow the rules the police will have the powers to enforce them, including through fines and dispersing gatherings.\n",
      "To ensure compliance with the Government’s instruction to stay at home, we will immediately:close all shops selling non-essential goods, including clothing and electronic stores and other premises including libraries, playgrounds and outdoor gyms, and places of worship; we will stop all gatherings of more than two people in public – excluding people you live with;and we’ll stop all social events , including weddings, baptisms and other ceremonies, but excluding funerals.Parks will remain open for exercise but gatherings will be dispersed.I understand that it’s phrased carefully, with just enough sympathy for you to feel it’s absolutely necessary, or they wouldn’t be doing it.I’ve seen that the vast majority of people, at least where I live, being cautions, and most places are shut.This move is nonsensical, and rooted in distrust.Basically, what the power elite wants is to cripple all form of social contact for the foreseeable future (AT LEAST 3 weeks), and slowly but slowly small and even some medium sized businesses will collapse as we have the ‘creep’.  Let’s see, I’m not judging… but 3 weeks can become 4 weeks, and it can become 6 weeks, or much worse.Right now, we don’t have any real say, because we’ve all given our power away.The government, of course, will be seen to be doing its bit.. it’s “promised” to help, to give out money to protect the economy (which was created by us yesterday) and if you fail, well, it’s your own fault. Of course, the government will be sad to see individuals and families struggle, but what can they do?  They don’t make the rules, do they?  They are just trying to save lives.. after all, the medical system is the ONLY ONE capable of such things. The human body is faulty and stupid, and it’s dangerous to think otherwise.Let’s just forget about the all the evidence that points to the fact that the human body is highly intelligent!We Are Social Beings. What do people usually do in times of crisis?  They come together to join hands, literally and metaphorically!We always do best when we are united, not split up into tiny fragments.What kind of ‘new normal’ do we want?  This is the vital question!  Not the virus – which is going to do what it’s going to do for God’s sake.I hear all the time ‘the hospitals can’t cope’ – well, of course they can’t.  They weren’t designed to!  The government has been getting rid of beds for the past few decades, reducing staff, moving parts of it into private hands as well!And now it “cares”, all of a sudden?  It is the ‘saviour’ of all of us, is it?Who caused the mass fear and panic, and the rush to the hospitals?  The media narrative.Let’s ask a basic, very human question: What if we all took care of each other instead of relying on the state to save us?We are all very capable of helping our loved ones through even the worst  of illnesses and sicknesses most of the time – but we’re being told a scare story… you’ll get sick, you’ll kill your loved ones (so you’ll be to blame), you won’t be able to fight this virus and you need the governmental solutions that are coming (vaccines).We must wake up from our lethargy and distinguish between catching the virus itself (remember, thousands of people have got better WITHOUT medical intervention) and the overreaction or under-reaction of the body itself.The global mainstream media is constantly whitewashing the death statistics since it’s easier to scare us that way! Why don’t they encourage us with statistics of how many are RECOVERING?The greatest coup against humanity to date?The human ego in all of us lives in constant fear of death – and what is the ego?  It is you as the body, along with your thoughts and emotions.This is deeply understood by all those who have the (military) power, and it’s used all the time to control the ‘enemy’.  In this case, us.The public is the enemy, not the virus.  Do you see?A subtle shift in awareness can see this very easily.How the ego operates, Firstly, the ego fears psychological death — so it attacks anyone with a different opinion, particularly anyone who doesn’t conform to accepted narrative.  So, we’re going to fight against those who ‘don’t listen.’Do as you’re told!Secondly, it lives in constant fear of physical death, the ultimate annihilation for the ego.  From a spiritual vantage point, all forms dissolve. Some dissolve quickly, some more slowly, but we will all face death sooner or later, is this not true?Today’s Western society lives in a deep fear of death – death is, in fact, hidden away in the closet and rarely looked at.Today, the constant flashing up of an “increasing death rate” into people’s minds is causing more and more panic, more and more doubt in ourselves and our bodies.Please don’t believe for a second that THE SYSTEM now suddenly gives a sh*t about the old, the frail or vulnerable.  It really couldn’t care less – it’s a joke.  If it cared, it would be cocooning them, helping them feel safe, giving them vital nutrition, informing them how to boost their immune systems and deploying technological medical advances to keep them safe upfront. Also, suddenly all the governments who never had the money to support us (the public) can now suddenly create — out of thin air — trillions of dollars (pounds/euros whatever)?  Why? So we can be DEPENDANT on THEM as we spiral downward into a massive depression.  Make no mistake, it’s coming as we sit back and just follow the narrative.This rolling out of ‘problem reaction solution’ is now unfolding before us and controlling everyone’s behaviours – and it’s a flashpoint.  You, apparently, can harm me, and i can harm you etc.  TRUST is being eroded between us.This self-isolating for long periods of time does.  It BREAKS the human spirit.The way the ‘control’ of the ‘virus’ is being handled is a chilling coup against humanity.Skewed Data and What About 5G?According to GreenMedInfo.com, “serious doubts about the accuracy of COVID-19 testing methods, results, mortality rates, and the supposedly unique and extreme lethality of this virus are starting to emerge… A recent study released by Italy’s national health authority found that nearly everyone who was pronounced dead from COVID-19 was already struggling with serious chronic disease(s).”But the most brilliant analysis of the data and the GLOBAL PICTURE to date comes from a lady called Dana Ashlie, who has meticulously researched the rather inconvenient link between 5G and the spread of the virus globally.  Do you know 5G was very active in Wu-han when the outbreak happened?Pharma and Compulsory Vaccination.Pharma and Vaccine companies benefit from a sickness and disease model, and they will do anything to protect it.Right now, many people rightly refuse to vaccinate for the flu, and for other types of diseases where they feel it isn’t necessary  — but NOW it will become mandatory by law to have everything Big Brother (the Global State) tells you to have.And because everybody is broken up into teeny, tiny pieces, we are feeling our most vulnerable and alone.  But it’s “for our own good” and we will “save the world”!  How poetic!Soon to be in a theatre near you, pharma will unveil the ‘magic bullet’ solution, injecting us all with adjuvants that contain (amongst other things) aluminium and  viruses from monkeys and foetuses — but it will be for our own “bodily health” and to “protect us” from each other, even though we face economic collapse.\n",
      "It seems we will do anything to save ourselves at this point.Is the human spirit BROKEN?Again, if we care to piece the puzzle together, we’ll see that the narrative is about:Making us fearful — and keeping us in fear.Giving us a powerful TOP DOWN solution to remove the FEAR later on. Making sure we never question the narrative from the top ever again – so that we are ‘humbled’ before the system and Pharma (the God/Saviour of humanity)… we all need a saviour right now, don’t we?  (Not).Job Done.Bill Gates recently stepped down from Microsoft to concentrate on more “philanthropic efforts” and that particular individual will only invest his money where hundreds of trillions of dollars in return can be made.Mandatory human vaccines fit the bill for this particular agenda because Gates set up the Gates Foundation to deal with developing new vaccines.The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Wellcome, and Mastercard recently committed up to $125 million in seed funding to speed-up the response to the COVID-19 epidemic — and this very small investment pales in comparison to the colossal return he will make when the vaccine is announced and the world world is ready to have it injected for fear of getting the virus again.  Do the math.Most people have bought the narrative of self-isolation and the “problem reaction solution” is firmly rooted in place, all in the proverbial blink of an eye.Time has moved quickly, and we haven’t had a chance to literally ‘catch our breath.’On social, I’ve seen people talking about how the skies are clearer, how the birds are singing, how everything is healing… well, this might be true, and I love that! But please, DON’T think for a moment that the well-oiled machine of Pharma, GM foods, Vaccines, the ongoing destruction of our Rainforests, the killing of our wildlife, Big Oil and Gas exploration (fracking) and so forth isn’t going to kick back in if we are unable to take care of ourselves because we are facing financial losses of immense proportions.If we descend into the pit of hell where we can’t even take care of ourselves, then survival issues kick in, and the wider humanitarian issues disappear overnight, and your government knows this:Organic foods, gone … or will be too expensive to buy.Many or most small family businesses gone.Sustainable businesses and industry gone. Green energy, gone – or very limited access to it – or, worse, controlled by those who currently have all the power.Yoga studios, gyms and other ‘health’ places gone – or seriously reduced, with dependancy on meds being practically the only choice.Anyone else seeing what I’m seeing?The Global State is coming to ‘save’ you.I believe in the basic good of humanity BUT we still have war/genocide on this planet, torture, toxic pollutants, death by medicine, and God only knows what else. We have been asleep at the wheel, allowing these systems to pollute our minds and, right now, we are witnessing the final blow.Those who truly run this world – and i’m talking about people with TRILLIONS in their pockets, which is NO small thing – are seeing just how much we will accept. Right now, I’m seeing friends on facebook towing the ‘party line’.  The language is telling: Stay At Home.Do the ‘right’ thing.Flatten the curve.We just accept and repeat, don’t we?The three lines above are actually the voice of the Collective Ego talking to us, TELLING us not to think for ourselves, not to question THE PLAN.The collective ego, if you don’t already know, is utterly mad and dysfunctional.Your spirit would NEVER do this to you – the spirit empowers you to take care of yourself by facing death head on.  Even if you cannot overcome death, the coming together of humanity is a salve that would immediately bring DEEP PEACE.But your government knows that, and doesn’t want it.  Stick to the agenda.Watch the sinister conversation from Event 201 on Dana Ashlie’s video… how they simulated a CV pandemic, and the measures they would take to break us down, and to then gain our trust.Remember, just two weeks ago the UK Prime Minister was telling the UK people that they would absolutely not have any draconian measures imposed upon them – and that this approach was based on clear science.  We were told, very clearly, that we would not be following Europe’s or China’s example.Now look at the colossal change in a very short space of time… step by step the noose is being tightened around everyone’s necks.But, don’t worry, it’s for our own good!People look at the news and thus they say things have got worse… but WHY have they?  It is because of the virus alone?NO!  It is the separation from each other that is KILLING US.We are very good at swallowing this meticulously crafted story, are we not?Over and over again we go back for more.The link between 5G and 60Ghz causing harm to humans is clear.  People in Wu-han were falling over dead with 5G, having seizures, and heart arrhythmia, and also a dry cough that attacks the lungs.  Since when did a ‘pneumonia like flu’ be totally dry?  See Dans’s video.But practically no one in mainstream media has been alking about it, or is talking about it.  Complete silence, in fact.Collectively, we need to wake up right now and see this nightmare for what it is — a colossal taking back of mind power BY THOSE IN POWER.The Flu – where has it gone?According to Dr Vernon Coleman, a former GP and the author of over 100 books, the World Health Organisation estimates that the number of people dying from ‘seasonal influenza’ each year is between 290000 and 650000, and that, in a bad year, well over half a million people die from the flu. In one bad winter month, the death toll from flu could approach 100000.That’s not the number who get it. That’s the number who die from it.And the “deadly” coronavirus? Today, the official figure is 16000 people have died of the coronavirus since the first diagnosis was made, and about 6000 cases are in Italy, one of the worst countries hit.Italy has had 5G.But we’re not asking the right questions.  In fact, very few are questioning anything at all.We live and walk in a collective nightmare and we seem incapable of getting ourselves out of it.Open your eyes humanity – the boogeyman is not real.We CAN cope with illness and even death from a virus, but a “living death” imposed on us by an Orwellian global society will be far, far worse… and, ironically, lead to even more deaths over the long term.For a start, when you are in fear or depressed, your immune system is drastically weakened, that’s a hard fact to be concerned about!Nobody “at the top” is bothering to tell you how to strengthen your immune system. Why?  Nobody is discussing the link between 5G, the frequency of 60Ghz, and the outbreak of CV. Why?Because that would be self-defeating! It would empower you!It’s best to tell you to hide behind the warm skirt of Big Brother until it tells you it’s 100% safe to come out.  Then you do ANYTHING the state tells you!Today, we have allowed SECRECY to be allowed, instead of TRANSPARENCY.  It’s astounding – and, even now, we are still blind as to the true motives going on behind the scene.David Icke, is his analysis correct?A new video was recently posted featuring an interview with the famous David Icke.I leave it to you to witness the unfolding events on the world stage, and to see if any of his comments stack up!  I don’t resonate with everything Icke says, but I do resonate with a lot of it.  The unfortunate thing is that he is labelled as a ‘conspiracy theorist’ and most people switch off when they hear those two words together. In fact, so do I. But we have an opportunity to go beyond labels and seeing the information ‘as it is.’Just listen, and then playback what’s happened since January in your own mind.  Do you see the correlation?The ramifications of the lock-downs: Psychology 101.Will we all hide in fear of this particular virus for another 4 months (to 18 months!!) whilst the world economy collapses and people hit absolute rock bottom?  Who is going to be there to pick up the pieces?NOT the governments of this world, let me tell you that unequivocally now.I’m not anti-government, but I AM anti BS.  I’m against the FEAR being spread daily.The only weapon we have is truth and love – both will always dissolve fear.Truth might NOT be comfortable to hear – because most people have been conditioned not to question their government(s)?  Even highly intelligent people.We can “self-isolate” for a short while but it will only damage us further because a very deep fear that has been sown into our minds.Think about what it’s going to you.Healing ourselves: making the decision to have courage.We have to make the individual and collective effort to face the virus with courage, not fear.  And to handle it with more grace – something that the governments of this world will never be able to give us.We must not allow our very livelihoods to collapse because of guilt and fear.If we stay connected, with each other, we may make a new decision about whether to return to work sooner – right now, I don’t see anyone petitioning the governments.Sure, we will have some sicknesses and even deaths, but we will NOT be imposed upon by an invisible tyranny.WE must remember that our bodies CAN kill the virus — and that’s the CORE message we need to hear right now – but we’re not hearing it, ever.We also need to give ourselves permission to drop the fear, and the guilt of the virus spreading and “killing others.”  This separates us from being connected and powerful. And finally, remember that nobody can control life and death, least of all our governments and experts.Today, we can choose to stand in our power and become an enlightened society, or we can descend into the hell of an autocratic technocracy, where we are subservient to a medical, faceless God.We have FORGOTTEN the strength and power of the human body – and the fact that it can fight off diseases, even pandemics.  Not everyone will survive but, together, we will be stronger.  Doing what we are collectively doing today, we will be totally broken and unable to even function.WE are being PLAYED.\n",

      "Not long before Chinese coronavirus started making global headlines, The Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, in partnership with the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, held a high-level pandemic exercise called “Event 201” that seems to have been a predictive blueprint for what’s now transpiring with the coronavirus outbreak.On October 18, 2019, representatives from each of the aforementioned groups descended on New York City to discuss how they would respond to “a severe pandemic” much like the one we’re now being told is spreading across China and into the West.The exercise “illustrated areas where public / private partnerships will be necessary during the response to a severe pandemic in order to diminish large-scale economic and societal consequences,” an official announcement from Event 201 reads.“In recent years, the world has seen a growing number of epidemic events, amounting to approximately 200 events annually,” the announcement goes on to explain. “These events are increasing, and they are disruptive to health, economies, and society.”According to the event’s organizers, a pandemic like the one we could be seeing form right now before our very eyes requires “cooperation” among governments, industries, and “key international institutions” – the latter presumably referring to organizations like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n",
      "Is coronavirus yet another ploy to thin the “herd” and sell more vaccines?The timing of Event 201 is nothing short of suspicious in light of the fact that coronavirus is all the media is talking about right now. It’s even eclipsing President Trump’s impeachment proceedings in the Senate, with news about entire cities in China that are home to tens of millions of people being put under mandatory quarantine.We’re also seeing headlines about coronavirus popping up in major U.S. cities like Seattle, Houston and Chicago, which is starting to generate panic here in our own country about how far this thing will go before either fizzling out – a best-case scenario – or spreading like wildfire.As Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, is now warning, the rapid adaptation or mutation of coronavirus suggests that this might be another weaponized viral strain that was intentionally unleashed for eugenics purposes.Mainstream reporting is admitting that coronavirus is constantly changing like some kind of self-replicating bioweapon, which is all too convenient considering that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation-funded Pirbright Institute owns a patent on coronavirus for vaccine creation purposes.Was this whole outbreak engineered for the purpose of scaring the general public into accepting yet another government vaccine? Is it also about depopulating the planet as part of Bill Gates’ admitted efforts to use vaccination and “health care” as a means of reducing the world’s population by 10 to 15 percent?Time will tell what becomes of this latest public health scare, but one thing is for sure: Bill Gates and his eugenicist buddies are chomping at the bit to vaccinate the entire planet against coronavirus and any other disease they can conjure up as a deadly bioweapon.At the current time, the fatality rate associated with coronavirus infection is relatively low, around two percent. But that could very quickly change as the virus mutates and adapts to new environments, creating the horrific scenario predicted by Event 201.“Experts agree that it is only a matter of time before one of these epidemics becomes global – a pandemic with potentially catastrophic consequences,” the Event 201 description ominously forebodes.“A severe pandemic, which becomes ‘Event 201,’ would require reliable cooperation among several industries, national governments, and key international institutions.”To keep up with the latest news about coronavirus, be sure to check out Outbreak.news.You can also learn more about how many of these contagion scares are pre-planned, engineered false flag events at FalseFlag.news.Eugenicist Bill Gates co-hosted a “high-level pandemic exercise” back in October, just in time for the patented coronavirus he helped fund to be unleashed\n",

      "Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates will launch human-implantable capsules that have ‘digital certificates’ which can show who has been tested for the coronavirus and who has been vaccinated against it.The 64 year old tech mogul and currently the second richest person in the world, revealed this yesterday during a Reddit ‘Ask Me Anything’ session while answering questions on the COVID-19 Coronavirus Pandemic.Gates was responding to a question on how businesses will be able to operate while maintaining social distancing, and said that, “Eventually we will have some digital certificates to show who has recovered or been tested recently or when we have a vaccine who has received it.”The ‘digital certificates’ Gates was referring to are human-implantable ‘QUANTUM-DOT TATTOOS’ that researchers at MIT and Rice University are working on as a way to hold vaccination records. It was last year in December when scientists from the two universities revealed that they were working on these quantum-dot tattoos after Bill Gates approached them about solving the problem of identifying those who have not been vaccinated.The quantum-dot tattoos involve applying dissolvable sugar-based microneedles that contain a vaccine and fluorescent copper-based ‘quantum dots’ embedded inside biocompatible, micron-scale capsules. After the microneedes dissolve under the skin, they leave the encapsulated quantum dots whose patterns can be read to identify the vaccine that was administered.The quantum-dot tattoos will likely be supplemented with Bill Gates’ other undertaking called ID2020, which is an ambitious project by Microsoft to solve the problem of over 1 billion people who live without an officially recognized identity. ID2020 is solving this through digital identity. Currently, the most feasible way of implementing digital identity is either through smartphones or RFID microchip implants. The latter will be Gates’s likely approach not only because of feasibility and sustainability, but also because for over 6 years, the Gates Foundation has been funding another project that incorporates human-implantable microchip implants. This project, also spearheaded by MIT, is a birth control microchip implant that will allow women to control contraceptive hormones in their bodies.\n",
      "As for ID2020, to see it through, Microsoft has formed an alliance with four other companies, namely; Accenture, IDEO, Gavi, and the Rockefeller Foundation. The project is supported by the United Nations and has been incorporated into the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals initiative.It will be interesting to see how Bill Gates and ID2020 will execute all this because many Christians, and surprisingly a growing number of Shia Muslims, are very opposed to the idea of microchipping and any form of body-invasive identification technology. Some Christian legislators and politicians in the United States have even tried to ban all forms of human microchipping.But, on the other hand, this is Bill Gates’ perfect opportunity to see the projects through because as the coronavirus continues to spread and more people continue to die from the pandemic, the public at large is becoming more open to problem-solving technologies that will contain the spread of the virus.The main reason many Christians and some Shia Muslims are opposed to body-invasive identification technologies, however helpful such technologies are for preventing pandemics, is because they believe that such technologies are the so called ‘Mark of Satan’ mentioned in the Bible and some Mahdi prophecies. In the Book of Revelations in the Bible, anyone who does not have this “mark” is not allowed to buy or sell anything.Last year in November, a Denmark-based tech company which had contracts to produce microchip implants for the Danish Government and the US Navy, had to cancel the launch of its supposedly “revolutionary” Internet-of-Things powered microchip implant after Christian activists attacked its offices in Copenhagen.Bill Gates will use microchip implants to fight coronavirus\n",

      "On March 12th, 2020, Anderson Cooper and Dr. Sanjay Gupta held a global town hall on “Corona Facts and Fears.” During the discussion, Anderson said to the viewing audience, “And, again, if you are concerned about coronavirus, and you haven’t gotten a flu shot…you should get a flu shot.”Setting safety and efficacy of influenza vaccination aside, is Anderson’s claim that the flu shot will help people fight COVID-19 remotely true? The short answer is no.In fact, the results of many peer-reviewed, published studies prove that Anderson’s recommendation may have been the worst advice he could have given the public.In searching the literature, the only study we have been able to find assessing flu shots and coronavirus is a 2020 US Pentagon study that found that the flu shot INCREASES the risks from coronavirus by 36%.“Receiving influenza vaccination may increase the risk of other respiratory viruses, a phenomenon known as “virus interference…’vaccine derived’ virus interference was significantly associated with coronavirus…” Here are the findings:2020 Pentagon study: Flu vaccines increase risk of coronavirus by 36% .Examining non-influenza viruses specifically, the odds of coronavirus in vaccinated individuals were significantly higher when compared to unvaccinated individuals with an odds ratio (association between an exposure and an outcome) of 1.36. In other words, the vaccinated were 36% more likely to get coronavirus.Many other studies suggest the increased risk of viral respiratory infections from the flu shot:2018 CDC Study: Flu shots increase risk of non-flu acute respiratory illnesses (ARI) in children.This CDC supported study concluded an increased risk of acute respiratory illness (ARI) among children <18 years caused by non-influenza respiratory pathogens post-influenza vaccination compared to unvaccinated children during the same period.2011 Australian Study: Flu shot doubled risk of non-influenza viral infections and increased flu risk by 73%.A prospective case-control study in healthy young Australian children found that seasonal flu shots doubled their risk of illness from non-influenza virus infections. Overall, the vaccine increased the risk of virus-associated acute respiratory illness, including influenza, by 73%.2012 Hong Kong Study: Flu shots increased the risk of non-flu respiratory infections 4.4 times and tripled flu infections.A randomized placebo-controlled trial in Hong Kong children found that flu shots increased the risk of non-influenza viral ARIs fivefold (OR 4.91,CI 1.04—8.14) and, including influenza, tripled the overall viral ARI risk (OR 3.17, CI 1.04—9.83).2017 Study: Vaccinated children are 5.9 more likely to suffer pneumonia and 30.1 times more likely to have been diagnosed with Allergic Rhinitis than unvaccinated children.Vaccinated children were 30.1 times more likely to have been diagnosed with Allergic Rhinitis and 5.9 times more likely to have been diagnosed with pneumonia than unvaccinated children.2014 Study: Influenza-vaccinated children were 1.6 times more likely than unvaccinated children to have a non-influenza “Influenza-like-illness” (ILI).Even more published science. The well-respected Cochrane Collaboration’s comprehensive 2010 meta-analysis of published influenza vaccine studies found that the influenza vaccination has “no effect” on hospitalization, and that there is “no evidence that vaccines prevent viral transmission or complications.The Cochrane Researchers concluded that the scientific evidence “seem[s] to discourage the utilization of vaccination against influenza in healthy adults as a routine public health measure.” In their meta-analysis, the Cochrane researchers accused the CDC of deliberately misrepresenting the science in order to support their universal influenza vaccination recommendation. Nevertheless, CNN and other mainstream media outlets continually broadcast CDC pronouncements as gospel and, ironically, ridicules those of us who actually read the science as “purveyors of ‘vaccine misinformation”.Pentagon Study: Flu Shot Raises Risk of Coronavirus by 36%\n",

      "Two documents reprinted on each argue that there are reasons to think that 5G radiation is greatly stimulating the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and therefore, an important public health measure would be to shut down the 5G antennae and particularly the small cell 5G antennae in close proximity to our homes, schools, businesses, house of worship and hospitals.The first of these documents published by Miller et al., concerns the impact of 5G radiation on the immune system of the body and also suggests that 5G radiation may also increase the replication of the virus.  In both of these ways, 5G radiation may be expected to make the COVID-19 pandemic much worse.\n",
      "The second of these documents is my own and is derived from a larger document on 5G radiation effects.  It starts with the history of 5G in Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the COVID-19 epidemic.  Wuhan is China’s first 5G “smart city” and is the location of China’s first 5G highway where 5G radiation is being used to test self-driving vehicles.  Approximately 10000 5G antennae were installed and activated in Wuhan in 2019, with approximately 75 to 80% of these installed and activated in the last 2 ½ months of the year.The epidemic was first detected near the beginning of that 2 ½ month period and became vastly more severe, with extremely large increases in numbers of cases and in deaths by the end of 2019.  That may, of course be coincidental.  South Korea, which became the site of the worst epidemic outside of China, has large numbers of 5G antennae all over the country.  The Milan area of Italy, the worst epicenter in Europe also is a 5G center.  And Seattle area, the worst area in the U.S. is also a major 5G area.  Reports predict that New York City will shortly become the largest epicenter in the US is another 5G site.  These non-Chinese epidemic areas are not discussed in my paper, but these findings are accurate.  Again, the locations of these epicenters in 5G areas may be coincidental.Electromagnetic fields, including the highly pulsed and therefore highly dangerous 5G millimeter wave radiation, act via activation of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) with VGCC activation producing five different effects, each of which have roles in stimulating the replication and spread of coronaviruses:\n",
      " Excessive intracellular calcium. Oxidative stress. NF-kappaB elevation. Inflammation. Apoptosis (programmed cell death).The predominant cause of death in the COVID-19 epidemic, is pneumonia and each of these five effects also have roles in pneumonia, such that each of them is predicted to greatly increase the percent of people dying death in this epidemic.  It seems highly plausible that 5G radiation is greatly increasing the spread of the epidemic and also the death rate in individuals that are infected.You may wish to consider all of this in conjunction with the broader findings with regard to the dangers of 5G and other effects apparently produced by 5G exposures.How then did we get to this state?  Many independent scientists, including myself, have argued that there should be no 5G rollout until there is extensive biological safety testing of genuine 5G radiation with all of its dangerous modulating pulses.  However the industry has refused to get independent 5G testing and the FCC and other regulatory agencies have refused to require such testing.  Furthermore, the EMF “safety guidelines” which are supposed to protect us from health impacts of EMF radiation have been shown, based on eight different types of highly repeated studies, to fail massively to predict biological effects. They therefore fail to predict safety [3].  It follows from this that all assurances of safety based on these “safety guidelines” are fraudulent.  Consequently, there is no evidence whatsoever of 5G safety and much evidence of lack of safety.It is my opinion, therefore, that 5G radiation is greatly stimulating the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and also the major cause of death, pneumonia and therefore, an important public health measure would be to shut down the 5G antennae, particularly the small cell 5G antennae in close proximity to our homes, schools, businesses, houses of worship and hospitals.  I will list some of my professional qualifications following the citations.The VGCC activation mechanism has been amazingly well accepted in the scientific literature.My first (2013) paper on it was placed on the Global Medical Discovery web site as one of the top medical papers of 2013.  That paper has been cited 255 times according to the Google Scholar database.  Most new scientific paradigms are only slowly accepted and this is much, much faster than usual. I have given 59 invited professional talks on this topic in 15 countries, including 4 prestigious keynote addresses.  I had been scheduled to give 1 more prestigious keynote address in April (has been postponed because of COVID-19). Two of my papers, my neuropsychiatric paper and my Wi-Fi paper, are each described by the publishing journal as being the most often downloaded paper in the history of each journal – stunning scientific  interest in both papers.My recent talks, one sponsored by the Dept. of Engineering and Applied Science at Queens University and the other at the World Congress on Physics in Berlin (where I was given a certificate of recognition) show together that both engineers and physicists are starting to realize the importance of this mechanism.Argument for a 5G – COVID-19 Epidemic Causation\n",

      "Remember last year when Washington Post reporters were boldly declaring that vitamins C and D could not (and should not) be used against respiratory infections? The information I was sharing about their use was deemed so dangerous to public health that I was branded as a \"fake news\" site by self-appointed, pharma-owned arbiters of truth like NewsGuard.How times have changed. After having defamatory lies published about me, vitamins C and D are now (finally) being adopted in the conventional treatment of novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. That just goes to show that when push comes to shove, the truth eventually prevails. When the medicine cabinet is empty, and doctors have limited options, suddenly the basics become viable again, and that is good news indeed, as it's likely to save thousands of lives, while keeping health care costs down.\n",
      "Vitamin C Treatment Implemented for Coronavirus Infection.As reported by the New York Post, March 24, 2020:1\"Seriously sick coronavirus patients in New York state's largest hospital system are being given massive doses of vitamin C … Dr. Andrew G. Weber, a pulmonologist and critical-care specialist affiliated with two Northwell Health facilities on Long Island, said his intensive-care patients with the coronavirus immediately receive 1500 milligrams of intravenous vitamin C. Identical amounts of the powerful antioxidant are then re-administered three or four times a day, he said … The regimen is based on experimental treatments administered to people with the coronavirus in Shanghai, China.'The patients who received vitamin C did significantly better than those who did not get vitamin C,' he said. 'It helps a tremendous amount, but it is not highlighted because it's not a sexy drug' … Weber … said vitamin C levels in coronavirus patients drop dramatically when they suffer sepsis, an inflammatory response that occurs when their bodies overreact to the infection. 'It makes all the sense in the world to try and maintain this level of vitamin C,' he said.\"A Northwell Health spokesperson has reportedly confirmed that vitamin C treatment is being \"widely used\" against coronavirus within the 23-hospital system. According to Weber, vitamin C is being used in conjunction with the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine and the antibiotic azithromycin, which have also shown promise in coronavirus treatment.Vitamin C Is a Vastly Underutilized Antiviral 'Drug'According to Dr. Ronald Hunninghake, an internationally recognized expert on vitamin C who has personally supervised tens of thousands of intravenous (IV) vitamin C administrations, vitamin C is \"definitely a very underutilized modality in infectious disease,\" considering \"it's really a premiere treatment\" for infections.\n",
      "In my interview with him, Hunninghake suggested one of the reasons why conventional medicine has been so slow to recognize the importance of vitamin C has to do with the fact that they've been looking at it as a mere vitamin, when in fact it's a potent oxidizing agent that can help eliminate pathogens when given in high doses. There are also financial factors. In short, it's too inexpensive. Conventional medicine, as a general rule, is notoriously uninterested in solutions that cannot produce significant profits. One of the primary reasons we're now seeing its use against COVID-19 is undoubtedly because we had no expensive drugs in the medical arsenal that could be turned to.In my March 17, 2020, interview with Dr. Andrew Saul, editor-in-chief of the Orthomolecular Medicine News Service, he mentions being in contact with a South Korean medical doctor who is giving patients and medical staff an injection of 100000 IUs of vitamin D along with as much as 24000 mg (24 grams) of IV vitamin C. \"He's reporting that these people are getting well in a matter of days,\" Saul says. As explained by Saul, vitamin C at extremely high doses acts as an antiviral drug, actually killing viruses. While it does have anti-inflammatory activity, which helps prevent the massive cytokine cascade associated with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, it's antiviral capacity likely has more to do with it being a non-rate-limited free radical scavenger. As explained by Saul in our interview:\"Cathcart's view is that you simply push in vitamin C to provide the electrons to reduce the free radicals. This is the way Cathcart and Levy look at vitamin C's function (at very high doses) as an antiviral. At modest doses, normal supplemental doses … vitamin C strengthens the immune system because the white blood cells need it to work. White blood cells carry around in them a lot of vitamin C … So, vitamin C is very well-known to directly beef up the immune system through the white blood cells.\"Vitamins C and D Finally Adopted as Coronavirus Treatment\n",

      "Vaccines, for Bill Gates, are a strategic philanthropy that feed his many vaccine-related businesses (including Microsoft’s ambition to control a global vaccination ID enterprise) and give him dictatorial control of global health policy.Gates’ obsession with vaccines seems to be fueled by a conviction to save the world with technology.Promising his share of $450 million of $1.2 billion to eradicate Polio, Gates took control of India’s National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI) which mandated up to 50 doses (Table 1) of polio vaccines through overlapping immunization programs to children before the age of five. Indian doctors blame the Gates campaign for a devastating non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP) epidemic that paralyzed 490000 children beyond expected rates between 2000 and 2017. In 2017, the Indian government dialed back Gates’ vaccine regimen and asked Gates and his vaccine policies to leave India. NPAFP rates dropped precipitously.The most frightening [polio] epidemics in Congo, Afghanistan, and the Philippines, are all linked to vaccines.\n",
      "In 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) reluctantly admitted that the global explosion in polio is predominantly vaccine strain. The most frightening epidemics in Congo, Afghanistan, and the Philippines, are all linked to vaccines. In fact, by 2018, 70% of global polio cases were vaccine strain.In 2014, the Gates Foundation funded tests of experimental HPV vaccines, developed by Glaxo Smith Kline (GSK) and Merck, on 23000 young girls in remote Indian provinces. Approximately 1200 suffered severe side effects, including autoimmune and fertility disorders. Seven died. Indian government investigations charged that Gates-funded researchers committed pervasive ethical violations: pressuring vulnerable village girls into the trial, bullying parents, forging consent forms, and refusing medical care to the injured girls. The case is now in the country’s Supreme Court.South African newspapers complained, ‘We are guinea pigs for the drug makers.’In 2010, the Gates Foundation funded a phase 3 trial of GSK’s experimental malaria vaccine, killing 151 African infants and causing serious adverse effects including paralysis, seizure, and febrile convulsions to 1048 of the 5949 children.During Gates’ 2002 MenAfriVac campaign in Sub-Saharan Africa, Gates’ operatives forcibly vaccinated thousands of African children against meningitis. Approximately 50 of the 500 children vaccinated developed paralysis. South African newspapers complained, “We are guinea pigs for the drug makers.” Nelson Mandela’s former Senior Economist, Professor Patrick Bond, describes Gates’ philanthropic practices as “ruthless and immoral.”In 2010, Gates committed $10 billion to the WHO saying, “We must make this the decade of vaccines.” A month later, Gates said in a Ted Talk that new vaccines “could reduce population”. In 2014, Kenya’s Catholic Doctors Association accused the WHO of chemically sterilizing millions of unwilling Kenyan women with a  “tetanus” vaccine campaign. Independent labs found a sterility formula in every vaccine tested. After denying the charges, WHO finally admitted it had been developing the sterility vaccines for over a decade.  Similar accusations came from Tanzania, Nicaragua, Mexico, and the Philippines.A 2017 study (Morgenson et. al. 2017) showed that WHO’s popular DTP vaccine is killing more African children than the diseases it prevents. DTP-vaccinated girls suffered 10x the death rate of children who had not yet received the vaccine. WHO has refused to recall the lethal vaccine which it forces upon tens of millions of African children annually.[Global public health officials] say he has diverted agency resources to serve his personal philosophy that good health only comes in a syringe.Global public health advocates around the world accuse Gates of steering WHO’s agenda away from the projects that are proven to curb infectious diseases: clean water, hygiene, nutrition, and economic development. The Gates Foundation only spends about $650 million of its $5 billion dollar budget on these areas.  They say he has diverted agency resources to serve his personal philosophy that good health only comes in a syringe.In addition to using his philanthropy to control WHO, UNICEF, GAVI, and PATH, Gates funds a private pharmaceutical company that manufactures vaccines, and additionally is donating $50 million to 12 pharmaceutical companies to speed up development of a coronavirus vaccine. In his recent media appearances, Gates appears confident that the Covid-19 crisis will now give him the opportunity to force his dictatorial vaccine programs on American children.GATES’ GLOBALIST VACCINE AGENDA: A WIN-WIN FOR PHARMA AND MANDATORY VACCINATION\n",

      "Occasionally, humanity is confronted with a series of events, oftentimes accompanied with tremendous human suffering, that appear to be so intricately linked and coordinated that to explain them as mere coincidence or conspiracy theory is not only reckless, but potentially criminal in itself.This month a petition was drafted for the federal government to call on Congress to investigate the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for “medical malpractice & crimes against humanity.”“As we look at events surrounding the ‘COVID-19 pandemic,” the appeal reads, “various questions remain unanswered.”“On Oct. 18th of 2019, only weeks prior to ground zero being declared in Wuhan, China, two major events took place. One is ‘Event 201,’ the other is the ‘Military World Games,’ held in none other than Wuhan. Since then a worldwide push for vaccines & biometric tracking has been initiated.”Already the petition has received over 450000 signatures, far surpassing the 100000 need for the president to take action on the issue.Although many people may have heard about Event 201, they may not be familiar with all of its details. Thus, it is crucial to examine what exactly took place at the event to see if there are any grounds for this public call for an investigation.Event 201.On October 18, 2019, the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, in partnership with the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation hosted Event 201, an exercise that entailed a simulated outbreak of a coronavirus “transmitted from bats to people that eventually becomes…transmissible from person to person, leading to a severe pandemic.” Sound familiar? Well, the similarities between the simulated event and our present grim reality do not end there.During the three-and-a-half-hour event, 15 representatives from the world of business, government, and public health were tasked with battling against the fictional outbreak, dubbed CAPS, which goes on to kill 65 million people worldwide over a period of 18 months. Here is what we are told about this fictional bug: the disease is transmissible by people with mild symptoms; there is no possibility of a vaccine being available in the first year; there is an antiviral drug that can help the sick but not significantly limit spread of the disease. Again, those are nearly the exact set of real circumstances the global community is presently confronting with Covis-19. But wait, it gets better.The exercise even had its very own ‘fake news’ channel, dubbed GNN, reporting on the minute-by-minute battle against the fictitious outbreak. An Asian-looking news anchor, Chen Huang, provides the following details on the pandemic. Keep in mind, all of this is being acted out 2 months before the real virus makes landfall.\n",
      "“Public health agencies have issued travel advisories, while some countries have banned travel from the worst affected areas,” Huang reported, with a gleam in her eye. “As a result, the travel industry is taking a huge hit; travel bookings are down 45% and many flights have been cancelled. “A ripple effect is racing through the service sector,” she said, a comment that probably made the crypto-currency community take note. “Governments that rely on travel and tourism as a large part of their economies are being hit particularly hard.”If Huang only knew the half of it.Next, the video returns to the closed door discussion group, as an ominous large-cap headline appears on the screen that reads: ‘TRAVEL AND TRADE RESTRICTIONS ARE HAVING PROFOUND ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES’Tom Inglesby from John Hopkins University seemed to be staring into a crystal ball when he asked: “How should national leaders, businesses and international organizations balance the risk of worsening disease that will be caused by the continual movement of people around the world against the risk of profound economic consequence of travel and trade bans?”Martin Knuchel, crisis manager from Lufthansa Airlines was no less prophetic, using the very same terminology being employed today with regards to “essential” and “non-essential” businesses.“What is essential or non-essential travel, we have to clarify this,” Knuchel stated. “Otherwise, if we go down to 20% bookings over a short period, the company will run down, that’s a fact.”Currently, Lufthansa has been forced to idle more than 90% of its fleet since the (real) coronavirus outbreak began in late December 2019.\n",
      "And then there was Christopher Elias, the smooth-talking head of the Global Development Division of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, discussing the need to secure the supply chains amid the pandemic.“There’s a whole complex set of issues in a highly interdependent world on supply chains that are ‘just in time’,” Elias warned. “We need to think about how much flex there is in that just in time supply chain system and make sure it keeps running.”Well, wouldn’t you know it? Just this week, Tyson Foods, one of the nation’s biggest meat processors, took out a full page ad in the New York Times in which it warned “the food supply chain is breaking.”“As pork, beef and chicken plants are being forced to close…millions of pounds of meat will disappear from the supply chain,” John Tyson, Chairman of the Board of Tyson Foods, wrote. “As a result, there will be limited supply of our products available in grocery stores until we are able to reopen our facilities that are currently closed.”But we’ve only just begun to enter the twilight zone.At this point, the exercise is interrupted once again by Chen Huang of GNN for some commentary from ‘David Gamble’, a disagreeable economist with an unfortunate name who represents the world of finance, and Dr. Juan Perez, a more photogenic spokesperson for the world of medicine.In this fake interview, Gamble opens by asking: “What exactly are the risks and benefits of slowing air travel, of staying home from work, closing schools, disrupting supply chains…and interfering with our reliable channels of communication and news.”“When this is all over, some families, some cities, will have suffered more from our intervention than from CAPS,” he predicts, again, with incredible foresight of things to come.In response to Gamble, Dr. Perez says: “Our response should aim to protect every life we can,” a statement few could disagree with. When Gamble retorts by suggesting that those lofty goals must be accomplished by protecting jobs and critical industries, Perez responds with this astounding remark: “As a physician, I am comfortable saying that our health response to CAPS cannot afford to wait for an incredibly complex debate about…history’s most expensive economic bailout.”Incredibly, the actor physician parrots the very same stance that has been taken by governments around the world: ‘Let’s not endanger a single life, but rather keep everyone at home as we shut down the bulk of the global economy, which may or may not be rescued by a bailout.’ The scripted comment by the fake doctor makes it seem as though the health of the global economy has no connection to the health and well-being of people the world over. Nothing could be further removed from the truth.At this point, it needs to be asked: what are the chances that an exercise simulating the outbreak of a global pandemic not only happens just weeks before the real event, but predicts its main features, which include the shutdown of businesses and schools worldwide, the loss of supply chains, as well as the most expensive bailout in history, among other things? At what point does the line separating fact from fiction, truth from lies become so blurred that it demands a criminal investigation?The Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, the host of the incredibly visionary exercise, may have been entertaining similar questions when it released a statement on the shocking array of coincidences, saying: “Recently, the Center for Health Security has received questions about whether that pandemic exercise predicted the current novel coronavirus outbreak in China. To be clear, the Center for Health Security and partners did not make a prediction during our tabletop exercise. For the scenario, we modeled a fictional coronavirus pandemic, but we explicitly stated that it was not a prediction.”Military World Games, Wuhan. As it turned out, on October 18, the very same day that Event 201 was being carried out in New York City, the Military World Games kicked off in Wuhan, China, which was reportedly ground zero for the outbreak of Covid-19.The 7th International Military Sports Council (CISM) Military World Games were hosted from Oct. 18 to 27, 2019 in Wuhan, capital city of central China’s Hubei Province. It was the first international military sporting competition to be held in China, with nearly 10000 athletes from over 100 countries competing in 27 sports.\n",
      "Following the outbreak of coronavirus in Wuhan, conspiracy theories popped up like mushrooms after a summer rain. Chinese newspapers began floating the idea that U.S. athletes competing in the games had unleashed the deadly virus while in Wuhan. The theories point to two things: the lackluster performance by the U.S. athletes, thus proving, according to some Chinese commentators, they were not sent to Wuhan for their physical prowess but rather for something more sinister. Second, their living quarters were close to the Huanan Seafood Market, where the first cluster of Covid-19 was detected on Dec. 31, 2019.So what is the connection to Bill Gates, who was certainly not participating in the Wuhan military games to shield more nefarious actions? On the surface, absolutely nothing. Yet for a philanthropist whose name is connected to nearly every major pharmaceutical company, and dozens of research groups, connections are bound to be made that may mean nothing. At the very least, however, they are worthy of attention.For example, how many people know that there is a patent for the coronavirus? It is owned by The Pirbright Institute, a biological research organization based in Surrey, England. The institute is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It’s important to note, however, that the coronavirus is the generic name for a group of related RNA viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans, these viruses cause respiratory tract infections that even include some cases of the common cold. Then there are the more lethal strains, like SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, for which The Pirbright Institute, one of many organizations looking to develop a vaccine against Covid-19, does not hold a patent.“The Institute was granted a patent in 2018 which covers the development of an attenuated (weakened) form of the coronavirus that could potentially be used as a vaccine to prevent respiratory diseases in birds, including IBV, and other animals,” a representative from the Pirbright Institute told USA TODAY.One more note on Wuhan. Less than one month after Event 201, and less than a month before the outbreak of Covid-19, Bill Gates appeared in the Netflix series ‘Explained’ with a documentary entitled, ‘The Next Pandemic.’ In it, the Microsoft co-founder warned that a pandemic could emerge from one of China’s many ‘wet markets,’ where shoppers can choose from a wide variety of live fish and animal products.In 2015, Gates also did a TED talk where he warned that the next catastrophe would not come from missiles, but rather microbes.So if Bill Gates seems to have the best interests of the world at heart, why is he so mistrusted?Why can’t we trust Bill?On March 13, Bill Gates announced he was stepping down from the board of Microsoft Corp., the company he co-founded in 1975, to devote more time to philanthropy.Since then, this technocrat in a wool sweater, who seems to be trying to channel the trust and tenderness of a Fred Rogers, regularly addresses prison planet from his mainstream media soapbox about how he is now devoted to making “vaccines in large quantities.” And, despite having neither scientific credentials nor an elected political post, Gates nevertheless has warned that mass gatherings “may not come back at all” without a vaccine.Apparently the time-honored biological function known as ‘herd immunity,’ which has worked fine for millennia against disease, is now considered out of fashion. Is that because it costs absolutely nothing, least of all in terms of our freedom and liberty? But I digress.Here is Gates lecturing in the Washington Post on April 1st: “The country’s leaders need to be clear: Shutdown anywhere means shutdown everywhere. Until the case numbers start to go down across America — which could take 10 weeks or more — no one can continue business as usual or relax the shutdown. Any confusion about this point will only extend the economic pain, raise the odds that the virus will return, and cause more deaths.”Needless to say, such non-professional advice is infuriating many Americans as opportunistic officials reveal their authoritarian impulses, unleashing a number of draconian lock-down orders, from prohibiting the mowing of lawns to banning swimming at the beach to snitching on family, friends and strangers for breaking with social-distancing decorum.So what do real doctors say about the coronavirus and the lockdown orders, which threaten to trigger a global depression? Many are totally dumbfounded by the decision. Writing in the Wall Street Journal, Dr. Eran Bendavid and Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, professors of medicine at Standford University expressed strong reservations over the lockdown, pointing to “deeply flawed” mortality projections rates for COVID-19.“Fear of Covid-19 is based on its high estimated case fatality rate—2% to 4% of people with confirmed Covid-19 have died, according to the World Health Organization and others,” Bendavid and Bhattacharya explained in their article, dated March 24. “So if 100 million Americans ultimately get the disease, two million to four million could die. We believe that estimate is deeply flawed. The true fatality rate is the portion of those infected who die, not the deaths from identified positive cases.”Not only does Bill Gates’ relentless push for a global vaccine against Covid-19 carry the scent of greed, especially when it is considered how heavily invested he is in its development, but the computer engineer turned ‘medical expert’ seems overly enthusiastic over vaccines that carry biometric surveillance technology.While many people would probably have little qualms about rolling up their sleeve for a vaccination that protects them from a deadly virus, many would certainly question the added-on feature of tracking technology that would give the powers-that-be total control over every person.Not only does Gates support the creation of a “national tracking system” to tag the infected, but Microsoft is among the founding members of ID2020, a San Francisco-based biometric company that recently announced it was undertaking a new project that involves the “exploration of multiple biometric identification technologies for infants” that is based on “infant immunization” and only uses the “most successful approaches”.Can it get creepier than that? Unfortunately, yes it can.Two weeks after Bill Gates left the board of Microsoft, the company received a patent for a ‘cryptocurrency system body activity data.’ Although the details on the technology are truly shocking the patent number also had conspiracy theorists in an uproar: WO2020060606. It didn’t take much for Internet sleuths, not to mention Bible enthusiasts, to say this stood for: ‘World Order 2020 666.’Of all the millions of patent numbers that could have been used, why this one? As is the case with customized license plate numbers, did Gates personally request such a configuration that was bound to trigger fear and suspicion – in the middle of a pandemic, no less?Although the cryptocurrency invention makes no specific mention of nanotechnology injected under the skin, possibly together with a vaccine, the opaque description doesn’t rule it out either: “The cryptocurrency system communicatively coupled to the device of the user may verify if the body activity data satisfies one or more conditions set by the cryptocurrency system, and award cryptocurrency to the user whose body activity data is verified”.Judging by this and other such activities on the part of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, it becomes easier to understand why so many people fear the very worst about their true goals. Whether that high level of distrust should translate into a federal investigation, that is a question best left to the reader to decide.Is It Time to Launch an Investigation Into the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for Possible ‘Crimes Against Humanity\n",

      "For three months, we’ve been urging our readers to pursue sensible nutritional strategies to boost immune function and protect against infections. Now a study carried out by Northwestern University has found that higher vitamin D levels result in lower mortality rates from covid-19 infections.Vitamin D deficiency, according to the study, was significantly linked to the development of severe symptoms and complications leading to death.\n",
      "The study, published in medRxiv, is entitled, “The Possible Role of Vitamin D in Suppressing Cytokine Storm and Associated Mortality in COVID-19 Patients.”The study used data from coronavirus patients across multiple nations, including the UK, the USA, China, France, Italy and South Korea. Those patients who had the lowest vitamin D levels had the highest risk of complications such as the “cytokine storm” immune reaction that leads to rapid death.\n",
      "“[W]e saw a significant correlation with vitamin D deficiency,” says study author Vadim Backman.The research paper concludes, “Our finding suggests that Vit. D may reduce COVID-19 severity by suppressing cytokine storm in COVID-19 patieThe paper is careful to note that vitamin D should not be considered a kind of miracle cure for covid-19 and that more research needs to be conducted to further explore the relationship.The paper was also covered by StudyFinds.org, which explains:All of the data used for this study was publicly available, and an in-depth analysis revealed a correlation between vitamin D levels and cytokine storm (a form of hyper-inflammation due to an overactive immune system). A relationship between vitamin D and mortality rates among COVID-19 patients was noted as well.So, the research team believe vitamin D is helpful against COVID-19 because it simultaneously boosts our existing immune systems while also preventing new immune responses from going over board.“Our analysis shows that it might be as high as cutting the mortality rate in half,” Backman says. “It will not prevent a patient from contracting the virus, but it may reduce complications and prevent death in those who are infected.”However, it is clear that vitamin D deficiency is harmful, and it can be easily addressed with appropriate supplementation. This might be another key to helping protect vulnerable populations, such as African-American and elderly patients, who have a prevalence of vitamin D deficiency.Why is no government leader recommend vitamin D or zinc?With research like this clearly showing a drastic reduction in mortality from a simple, low-cost and very safe supplement that’s widely available right now, it begs the question: Why isn’t anyone in government recommending nutrition as a way to protect public health while we attempt to reopen the economy?Even worse, why are governors restricting people from going to the beach where they generate vitamin D for free as they are absorbing healing sunlight? That’s the beauty of vitamin D: Your body makes it at no charge, but not if you’re locked down in your own home, which seems to be part of the big plan to cause mass suffering and death.President Trump is pushing hard for 300 million doses of a vaccine by the end of the year, but he completely fails to mention vitamin D and zinc. These solutions could be saving lives right now, and they don’t need months (or years) or testing, since they have a long track record of safe, effective use (and are incredibly affordable).The real answer, of course, is that Big Pharma doesn’t want people to stay healthy with nutrition. They’d rather see people sick and suffering, waiting for a vaccine or another high-priced prescription drug that barely even works (like remdesivir, which saves no lives at all).And since the drug companies run the White House, the media, Big Tech and medical schools, there’s virtually no one in any position of power that’s willing to risk the ire of the drug companies by recommending safe, simple, low-cost nutritional supplements that might make drugs and vaccines obsolete.\n",
      "The Big Pharma scheme, you see, demands that the American people stay locked down until there’s a vaccine, at which time the entire US economy will be shattered and beyond repair.Trump should order the government to manufacture vitamin D + zinc supplements and give them away to all Americans This is why I’ve called for the government to manufacture and give away key supplements that may help prevent coronavirus infections. For a fraction of the price of the multi-trillion-dollar bailouts that have already been paid, the federal government could provide free vitamin D, zinc and vitamin C for the entire population.Health care costs would plummet across the board, and Big Pharma would lose hundreds of billions of dollars as fewer people are diagnosed with a long list of diseases and chronic conditions that are prevented through nutrition. And that’s exactly why any plan to keep America healthy will be halted by those in power. A healthy nation doesn’t need Big Pharma, and Big Pharma provides the re-election campaign money that keeps corrupt lawmakers in power. The drug cartels also provide about 70% of the ad revenue to the corrupt mainstream media, which is why the media relentlessly attacks natural remedies while pushing toxic, high-profit prescription drugs and vaccines.So to keep the gravy train rolling, they have to keep the American people locked down and sick. That’s why knowledge about nutrition is also being censored by Twitter, YouTube, Facebook and Google, among other tech platforms.That’s partly why I’ve been banned everywhere: Because I’ve been promoting nutrition and disease prevention for two decades, costing the drug giants hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenues.You absolutely must watch this important mini-documentary to learn more about how Big Pharma is using the coronavirus pandemic to enslave the human race and trap people in a cycle of disease and harmful vaccinations:Vitamin D identified as the “survival nutrient” against covid-19… could cut mortality rate in HALF, say researchers\n",

      "The truth about novel coronavirus is starting to trickle its way out of the realm of independent science with new research pointing to strange anomalies in the virus’s genetic structure that suggest it’s more than likely a bioweapon. Published in the online journal bioRxiv, the study found that novel coronavirus contains “key structural proteins” from HIV. Entitled, “Uncanny similarity of unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV spike protein to HIV-1 gp120 and Gag,” the paper identifies four unique insertions in the virus’s spike glycoprotein that aren’t present in any other form of coronavirus, meaning this one is a whole different animal. The paper goes into further specifics about how these inserts do not appear to be natural, concluding that the engineering of novel coronavirus with these unusual gene sequences “is unlikely to be fortuitous in nature,” again pointing to its unnatural origin. Almost nobody knows about this study because the mainstream media is ignoring it and its implications. And independent media outlets like Zero Hedge that have dared to report on it are now being systematically censored from Twitter and other social media platforms for spreading “misinformation.” Be sure to watch the below Health Ranger report from Brighteon.com about the coronavirus situation, entitled “Coronavirus is BIOLOGICAL WEAPON system designed to destroy America:” Was the release of novel coronavirus an accident or intentional? Based on the information put forth by Zero Hedge that got the site banned from Twitter, it appears that novel coronavirus is, in fact, a manufactured bioweapon. The question that remains is whether or not it was accidentally or intentionally released. Dr. Peng Zhou, Ph.D., the scientist who Zero Hedge outed for working with deadly viruses at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, very well could have been involved with research on this particular virus that potentially went terribly wrong. Or, it’s possible that it was developed on purpose as a covert bioweapon to unleash havoc on the world. Keep in mind that the aforementioned paper has since been retracted, meaning someone got to the researchers who published it and pressured them to withdraw it, presumably because it contains too much truth. There’s obviously much more to the story than we’re all being told, and yet the corporate media continues to publish lies – or nothing at all – about the true origin of novel coronavirus. We’re all expected to just believe the narrative that bats and snakes at a seafood market caused this, case closed. “No doubt the authors of this particular paper have been sufficiently threatened to revise their conclusions, and an update of their original paper will soon be posted that effectively denounces everything they stated in the original paper,” Adams contends. “The criminal wing of the science establishment strikes again, of course, and this tactic of threatening scientists with loss of funding, being blacklisted or even physically threatened and killed is not unusual at all.” Time will tell if anything becomes of politically incorrect science like this that lets the cat out of the bag, so to speak.

      "Exceptional situations like the current Covid 19 pandemic unsettle and scare many people. Doubts and questions are often branded as \"conspiracy theory\". The \"Handelsblatt\" has now written: \"Bill Gates: The Man Who Predicted the Corona Pandemic\". But it ignored a not unimportant fact.Rumors already circulated in January that the world's second richest person, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, could have something to do with the outbreak of the new Sars-Cov-2 virus from the family of corona viruses and the resulting disease Covid-19 . It was pointed out that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation was involved in the pandemic simulation game \"Event 201\" on October 18, 2019 in New York. Shortly afterwards, the outbreak of the new virus in the Chinese city of Wuhan was reported, which has meanwhile global consequences.Uno plans to establish global coronavirus control foundation - Oslo.A number of established media quickly tried to refute this rumor about gates in so-called fact checks. It also referred to a message from the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security of the university of the same name, which was also involved in the business game, on January 24. It was called it: \"The scenario we have modeled a fictional coronavirus pandemic, but we have explicitly stated that this is not a prediction.\" After all went digital \"sandbox exercise\" of 65 million deaths worldwide from. This was not predicted for the actual corona pandemic, it was emphasized afterwards.Now , on March 19, the newspaper \"Handelsblatt\" published an article entitled \"Bill Gates: The Man Who Predicted the Corona Pandemic\". However, no reference is made to the business game. Instead, attention was drawn to a post, the gates in the medical journal \"New England Journal of Medicine\" (NEJM) published had. In the text of February 28, the billionaire specifically addressed the Covid 19 outbreak and asked if it could be the “pandemic of the century”.\n",
      "Covid-19 like \"Spanish flu\"?The \"Handelsblatt\" recalled: \"The man who wrote the article in the NEJM is not a medical doctor or virologist, he has no degree. And yet the experts are listening to Bill Gates. ”This is because Gates“ has acquired a reputation as the greatest benefactor among the billionaires of the world with its foundation, which specializes in health initiatives ”.The Microsoft founder referred to the 1918 influenza epidemic, known as the \"Spanish flu\", with millions of deaths worldwide. He says Covid-19 is a similar threat. \"I hope it's not that bad, but we should assume that it will be until we know something else.\" One of the reasons Gates explains is that the new virus is more contagious than the original Sars virus.Gates is particularly worried about the countries with low to medium national incomes, especially poor countries, given the global spread. Their health care system is “thinned out”, which means that the new coronavirus can spread quickly there. But industrialized countries have had the problem for a long time as a result of the neoliberal austerity and privatization policies that have been going on for decades. Gates does not comment on this.Deadly austerity programs.In 2014, the two health economists David Stuckler and Sanjay Basu showed in their book “ Killing austerity programs” what consequences these have for those affected worldwide. \"Our finding is that the real danger to the health of the general public does not lurk in recessions per se, but in the austerity programs with which they are often 'combated'.\" The authors have demonstrated this using the example of various countries. Your book can at least help you understand the different starting points, since not all states followed the deadly austerity measures.Home lessons. \"Curfews are the wrong way\" - Renowned virologist on the corona crisis.Back to Gates: In his article in the British specialist magazine, he calls for more spending on medical research and health systems, especially in the weaker countries. And: \"But we also need major systemic changes so that we can react more efficiently and effectively when the next epidemic occurs.\" The billionaire is particularly demanding that more money be invested in the research of new, safe and effective vaccines.But he also emphasizes that vaccines and virus-inhibiting substances “should not simply be sold to the highest bidder”. They should be \"available and affordable\" for all concerned. Such a distribution they \"the right strategy\" to curb the current spread of Covid-19 and prevent future pandemics.Everything just a coincidence?Hardly anyone will contradict Gates' noble goals. The problem is certainly that even as a result of the neoliberal austerity policies, super-rich people like him are now taking on tasks that states and governments actually have in international cooperation. The credibility of such calls is constantly being questioned.In its article, the Handelsblatt points out that Gates has invested a lot of money in promising biotech companies - for example in the German company Curevac. \"The Gates Foundation invested $ 52 million in the Tübingen company five years ago to support the development of vaccines against malaria.\" But the company is now involved in the search for a vaccine against the new corona virus. It is considered so promising that, according to reports, US President Donald Trump wanted to buy the Curevac results exclusively for the United States.When Sputniknews asked, a spokesman for the company said: “The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation holds shares in CureVac, we do not provide information about their amount. Mr. Gates has no direct influence on the company, but there are always votes with his foundation. \"Billionaire Gates will certainly not be upset if the Curevac research is successful and governments buy vaccines against the new virus from the Tübingen company. It is surely a coincidence that he is a partner in Curevac and that his foundation co-hosted a pandemic simulation game shortly before Covid-19 actually broke out. Likewise that according to the \"Handelsblatt\" he \"predicted\" the pandemic. But it looks strange and invites you to ask questions.Covid-19: Has Bill Gates Predicted the Current Corona Pandemic?\n",

      "As the “novel” coronavirus originated in Wuhan is spreading to ten countries, more and more people including international bio-weapon experts are questioning its link to the Wuhan P4 lab located about 20 miles from a seafood market where the first few cases of human infections were found.A reliable source, one of the Chinese kleptocrats, told Miles Guo today that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) will admit to the public of an “accidental” leak of lab-created virus from a P4 lab in Wuhan to put blames on “human errors”. But the official announcement is still being finalized. Initially, the Chinese communist’s propaganda machines were blaming the virus on wild animals like bats by showing many videos of people eating bats. In January 2018, a bio-safety level four (BSL-4) laboratory was built in the city of Wuhan, which focuses on the control of emerging diseases and stores purified SARS and other types of viruses. It is supposed to act as a WHO ‘reference laboratory’ linked to similar labs around the world. The remaining question is whether the Chinese Communist Party leaked the virus on purpose as a desperate attempt to stay in power. There is no final conclusion yet, but the Chinese Communist Party acted suspiciously before, during and after the first case of Wuhan pneumonia: Wang Qishan visited Wuhan secretly during the time of the first “sign” of the deadly virus. The Chinese top kleptocrats like Han Zheng did not respond to any early reports of the mysterious Wuhan pneumonia sent by the government of Hubei province. The Chinese government deliberately covered up and delayed the reporting and containment of the mysterious pneumonia. The Chinese kleptocrat Wang Qishan, the Vice President of China, told his friend confidently that the outbreak would end in February while the epidemic is spreading out of control. The Chinese government deliberately abandon the residents, patients and medical staff at the epicenter without providing food, medical supplies or protective gear. The Chinese top kleptocrats handle the outbreak with a nonchalant attitude. Instead of talking or acting in ways to show concerns, they were celebrating Chinese New Year as if nothing has happened. The Chinese government has not done a lot to reduce the spread of the disease except for sending military forces to prevent people from escaping their cities or villages on lockdown. The Chinese government allows the fear to spread nationally and internationally to create an almost doomsday-like scene. The Chinese government rejected aid, monitoring, donation or assistance from the WHO to keep the epidemic in a black box.Breaking news: China will admit coronavirus coming from its P4 lab\n",

      "On the evening of Saturday, April 18, 2020, the forty thousandth (40000) “presumed COVID 19 death,” according to new CDC guidelines occurred. Where death only affects the few, the misinformation, withheld or suppressed data, the lies, the propaganda and censorship are making things worse. Thus, we turn to the format of a loose intelligence briefing as the infectious nature of propaganda has to be resisted and it is so very hard to resist. On the morning of Sunday, April 19, 2020 a propaganda blitzkrieg began, using Trump administration surrogates, claiming the deaths are really “fake people” and “empty hospitals.” We might call this “pandemic denial,” made dangerous as the pandemic, as of mid-late April 2020 is clearly in control and those claiming otherwise are knowingly lying for reasons we will make clear. Major medical centers across the US are at an average of 80% of capacity. Some are higher, much higher. In some areas temporary hospitals are being used but more often non-COVID patients are being “turfed” to rural medical centers where their needs may not be properly addressed. As with any emergency, the first victim is truth. Social media lends itself toward sensationalism and can attract those with victimization fantasies. Thus, only information from known sources is accepted and nothing from mainstream or social media can be trusted. The situation in American hospitals, not all but more than the public would imagine, is grave. Currently, PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) is in good supply with the exception of N95 masks and that situation is rapidly improving. Availability of ventilators in the US is currently very good, thanks to individuals like Elon Musk, the governments of Russia and China and many charitable organizations that have gone to great efforts. By “very good” we are speaking of supplies as predictive modeling indicates. One of the problems, however, is that the predictive models are predicated on assumptions not in evidence and are failing. This critical failure, and the cloak of secrecy around it, has given rise to the lunacy and subterfuge we are seeing in Washington. Part of that failure is at hospital level. To clarify, the issue is getting patents off ventilators. Nearly half of those on ventilators now are at or above 10 days and face a poor outcome. Claims that half may die are low. Most or all will die unless a late stage treatment protocol is developed in time. This is a life and death race and we are losing. Moreover, many patients who are never intubated but stay on cannula for oxygen, as we are told was the case with Boris Johnson, seem to recover then quickly succumb for no apparent reason. Johnson likely received Remdesivir, which has been denied other NHS patients. If so, the political fallout for Johnson, whose policies left the NHS grossly unprepared for the COVID 19 pandemic, will and should be catastrophic. The biggest morbidity factors are the following: Age (60 plus) Obesity. Smoking. Diabetes. Any other cardiopulmonary issues. The glaring question of irregular morbidity figures must be addressed. This is what we have learned: The healthcare systems of Italy and Spain were very much “not as represented.” Claims that the hospitals of Northern Italy, in particular, are among the “best in the world” is patently false. Were it not for Russian and Chinese aid, both Italy and Spain would have collapsed. Standards of care considered “normal” in Britain, France, Belgium, Spain and Italy rate at or below the worst in the US. That said, with massive medical infrastructure, the US was blindsided as well. Twenty percent of COVID 19 victims are healthcare professionals. Past that, vital support personnel for health care are primarily African American or Hispanic.This has given rise to issues of specific genetic vulnerabilities which are likely at this point overemphasized. Households with healthcare and support workers most often have one or more adults working away from home, often in areas of very high exposure.\n",
      "Past this we look at Iran, hard hit early on. If figures are to be believed, Iran peaked on March 29, 2020 and is showing a steady decline in new patients barring a second wave. Iran’s testing program has been more aggressive than most and if these figures are reliable, they offer some hope to nations, unlike the United States, that took the threat seriously.The material offered here is an intelligence briefing on a vital situation. The US government is keeping secret, even from state governors, the real situation with the COVID 19 pandemic, as a first wave, ending many lockdowns, by May 1, 2020 is planned. There is nothing worse than an election year in the United States, nothing worse except, maybe, an election year with a nation fully engaged in not just a pandemic but economic collapse as well. Never has the very real threat of extremism and totalitarianism been this close for the United States. We will be addressing this issue, the failure of governance but also the “elephant in the room,” how the lockdowns themselves are a panacea. Our models are failing, based on mixed data on acquired immunity.  We have had several reports this week that reinfection rates are high, particularly from South Korea. By the first week of February, the US had reached one of two scenarios, that could have only been mitigated by a quick vaccine, not possible, and assumptions on immunity that were not evidence based: Where a 10 lockdown would have applied on February 1, a two-month lockdown from mid-March to mid-May is likely to lead to waves of reinfection, through September.  Lockdown beyond that would do nothing and economic factors dictate opening up, taking the extinction level hit, to an unimaged level.\n",
      "This scenario advocates a May 1 end to lockdown, if continued reliable reinfection reports come in, which is likely to give us a “wash through” lasting until February 2021. Option 2 is most likely and may well be inexorable, a “wash through” combined with waves of reinfection.  New treatment protocols, and there few showing promise, would be the priority.  Generally, Hydroxychloroquine/Chloroquine is facing a dim future.  Side effects are devastating, and effectiveness has, thus far, been in only moderate cases and anecdotal. Convalescent serum is at an experimental stage and weeks from deployment. Initial tests show it to be useful in a percentage of cases with the following caveat, patients thus far either improve quickly or die of a reaction to the serum. This information is being withheld. We have promising antivirals, but these have only been used in non-defining test situations that, out of humanitarian concerns, do not have a double-blind. We are hopeful. Saying we have reached an ‘end of the world as we know it’ has both good and bad connotations.  Large military forces are no longer in the cards for the major powers.  It has been proven how easy it is to take a ship at sea down. There are so many ways to target infections to diminish military capability, there is now a weapon that makes any state a major player again, and the US is entirely to blame with their massive biological weapon research program.  You see, the US allowed the program to filter into the universities for ‘cover” as numerous treaties are being violated.  Every president since and including Clinton has a hand in this. Bush 41 tried to stop this and this and other reasons were why his presidency was ended, a story that will never be told.  Bush learned early about the planning of 9/11 and watched Clinton increasingly lose control of the reins as right wing extremist elements in Washington partnered with rogue elements in the Pentagon, CIA and the criminal elites of the former Soviet Union, soon to make up the core of the Kosher Nostra crime syndicate. Trump’s handling of this issue, if one is to assume his blunder was unintended, is the single biggest failure of governance in American history. While covering his tracks, working with organized crime to foster internal rebellion, wrongly targeting China and continually diminishing the presidency, a wave of damage that may eventually be more costly than the pandemic itself has been fomented. Oil will never be the same.  Fracking will never be profitable, current pipelines and refineries under construction are now useless as are those built in recent years, many at incredible cost to the environment. Russia’s moves into the Arctic are now likely to be curtailed. A good example will be Norway.  Their GDP for the next 48 months, even without a permanent market contraction, will be down by 15% with exports down 40% or a bit more. They will move from a social welfare state with a very high standard of living to a debtor nation in less than 5 years. This is a best-case scenario for the wealthiest of nations. Saudi Arabia is entering uncharted waters.  Clearly, Saudi Arabia and the UAE will end their issues with Iran. From Press TV: “A Saudi whistleblower has said that the number of Saudi royals infected with the coronavirus (COVID-19) has “exceedingly surpassed” figures previously revealed by a New York Times report. The Saudi al-Ahd al-Jadid Twitter account made the revelations on Friday, more than a week after the NYT report said as many as 150 Saudi royals had contracted the virus. The report at the time said that over 500 beds were being prepared at the elite King Faisal Specialist Hospital that treats members of the Saudi family. On Friday, however, al-Ahd al-Jadid, which is known for whistleblowing on high-profile cases within the Saudi court, revealed that the Saudi hospital reserved for the royals in the Red Sea port city of Jeddah had been overwhelmed with coronavirus cases. “The Jeddah specialist hospital, which is reserved for Saudi royals, is no longer capable of accepting new cases,” the Twitter account said. “Therefore, two hotels have been reserved to be fully used for accommodating and curing infected royals,” it added, naming one of the hotels as being the “Movenpick Hotel”. As of 1400 GMT on Friday, more than 7142 confirmed coronavirus cases were reported in the kingdom, with 87 deaths, according to a Reuters tally. Another Saudi whistleblower, Mujtahid, however, has cast doubt on official figures, arguing that the situation throughout the kingdom is much more critical. The reports of the COVID-19 disease spreading among royals come as the Saudi family is embroiled in a bitter power struggle between Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and his potential rivals, according to reports.” Nations like Iraq have been, thus far, exceptionally effective in limiting the spread of the pandemic. Their last case was on April 16, 2020 and thus far register only 82 deaths with over 500 active patients. Turkey is reporting a possible downturn, as of April 14, with new cases peaking a few days earlier at around 4500 new cases a day. Turkey, however, has nearly 80000 active patients and has been accused of significant underreporting. Russia’s COVID 19 surge began in April but cases are a small fraction of what the US is seeing with a mortality rate, based on official reports, half of that in the US.\n",
      "Conclusion. COVID 19, a disease that many experts weren’t expecting for a hundred thousand years, is a highly modified version of the Wuhan Horseshoe Bat Virus. It is not plausible that COVID 19 developed without a gene-splicing laboratory. The odds against such a disease developing naturally are astronomical yet we are continually informed of the opposite.In order to prepare this, front line medical personnel were interviewed, even interrogated to an extent, within parameters of required tenets of patient privacy laws. The truth, the horror of the truth, is worse than the dramatic twitter video. We are asking too much of far too few and this should never be allowed to happen again.We have turned medical personnel/first responders into “cannon fodder.”The Geopolitical Consequences of COVID-19: Over the Cliff\n",

      "China is conducting a clinical trial of 24000 mg/day of intravenous vitamin C to treat patients with coronavirus and severe respiratory complications. Participants will receive IV vitamin C for 7 days straight at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. Honor and thanks are due to Zhiyong Peng, MD, for making this happen. He is chief physician and professor at the hospital, which is close to ground zero for coronavirus. This important study was filed and announced yesterday and details may be confirmed.At Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan, China, 24000 mg of vitamin C will be administered to coronavirus patients, intravenously, each day for 7 days.To fight a dangerous virus for which there is no existing medical treatment, you must rely on your own immune system. It is well established, in every nutrition textbook ever written, that you need vitamin C to make your immune system work well, or to even work at all. Inadequate vitamin C intake is a worldwide problem that can be immediately and economically fixed. With even modest amounts of supplemental vitamin C, deaths will decrease. In one study, a mere 200 mg of vitamin C/day resulted in an 80% decrease in deaths among severely ill, hospitalized respiratory disease patients. Another recent study used this same low 200 mg dose for infants and children under five years of age, with severe pneumonia. The authors concluded that \"Vitamin C is effective in reducing duration of severe pneumonia in children less than five years of age. Oxygen saturation was improved in less than one day.\n",
      "A lack of vitamin C has been long known, literally for decades, to increase susceptibility to viruses. It is one thing to be sick from a virus and another thing entirely to die from a viral-instigated disease. The greatest danger with coronavirus is escalation to pneumonia. For this, much higher doses of vitamin C are indicated, preferably by IV.How to administer high-dose intravenous vitamin C in hospital, Chinese language edition, is now posted for free access. This information is now being publicized all over Asia. Just because it is not on the American news channels doesn't mean it's not happening. It is. This is real news.

      "As part of an upcoming presentation with GenSix.com, which streams on May 15-16th, I’ve been working to organization information that describes the “trifecta” of death science weapons which are now aimed at humanity. What I’m calling the “death science trifecta” consists of the coronavirus (biological weapons), 5G towers (electromagnetic weapons) and vaccines (chemical weapons). In combination, they are designed to enslave and then exterminate most human beings living today.That’s why there’s no real talk of restoring human freedom, or promoting pro-human free speech or even allowing anyone to advocate nutrition that can save lives. The globalists have zero interest in saving humanity… they are working to exterminate billions of human beings. And bioweapons, 5G and vaccines are the trifecta of mass death and tyranny that they’re using to accomplish their goal.I’ve put this into a must-see infographic shown below. It’s no accident the graphic is organized like the all-seeing eye and pyramid on the back of the US dollar. This is the structure of power over humanity that has been invoked by anti-human globalists for centuries.Take a look at the graphic here, and share everywhere, along with a warning. If humanity doesn’t rise up against our oppressors, we will be exterminated.To hear my full lecture on the death science trifecta, register at GenSix.com for the upcoming conference on May 15-16th. I’m presenting a nearly three-hour lecture on all this, detailing the real threats against humanity and how a small number of informed human beings may survive the extermination attempt.As you can see from the infographic above, depopulation is the end game of all this. Big Tech, Big Pharma and Big Science are all colluding to obliterate the human population on our planet. They are in, fact, preparing Earth for a post-human era.Here’s a preview snippet of what the lecture features:Globalists have decided they don’t need humans any longer, and their final act will be the global financial “reset” looting of all assets, combined with the global deployment of a vaccine euthanasia “kill switch” to cause billions of deaths. This is why they are now using armed government assault teams to raid and shut down anyone who promotes colloidal silver, vitamin C or chlorine dioxide, in order to eliminate any possibility of a nutrient or natural substance that might help protect the public from infections. They need to keep the path clear for vaccines to be the only “savior” of humanity. They can’t allow anything else to work first, you see. Vaccines must be the only option offered to the world.That’s the only way they can achieve widespread compliance with the euthanasia kill shots. They have to label them “vaccines” and tell people if they don’t take the shot, they won’t be allowed to participate in society. Big Tech is all part of this war on humanity, of course, as they are blacklisting all individuals or websites that dare to promote immune boosting strategies that might help protect humanity from a worsening pandemic.In essence, Big Tech, Big Pharma and Big Science have all become direct enemies of humanity, and they are engaged in a full-blown war on humanity, invoking (at least) three key weapons to destroy the human race: Biological weapons, electromagnetic weapons and chemical weapons.In truth, they’re also using pollution weapons (stratospheric aerosol injections /chemtrails), info weapons (engineered media disinformation) and genetic weapons (transgenetic weaponization of vaccine ingredients to alter the genetic code of vaccine recipients) too. At the same time, you may have noticed that the food supply is being deliberately destroyed in order to cause widespread famine and desperation. FEMA camps will offer soup kitchens and food bank “rescue” packages for the public, but as soon as the coronavirus vaccine is available, you’ll be required to show your “vaccine papers” to receive a food rescue package.Food scarcity, in other words, is being weaponized to force mandatory vaccines onto the public. When they are hungry enough, they will gladly line up to be injected with anything in exchange for a few meals. (And the globalists know this.) A mass awakening has begun… but will it emerge in time?Humanity is now on the brink. But there is also mass awakening taking place at this very moment, as billions of people around the world are coming to realize they are literally being enslaved with “house arrest” orders forced upon them by ignorant, incompetent, immoral “leaders” who refuse to recommend the nutritional solutions that can protect public health and help us all get back to normal living (things like zinc, vitamin D, vitamin C, elderberry extract and so on).Perhaps it will take the temporary experience of global enslavement to finally awaken humanity to the truth: You are a slave, Neo. You were born into a prison, a prison for your mind. And if you want to free your mind, you will need to reject the toxic chemicals, medicines, disinformation and technologies of the globalists. That means no 5G, no vaccines, no pharmaceuticals and no more living on processed junk food that makes you weak and dumbed down.Smash your iPhone. Put down the antidepressants. Turn off the brainwashing cable news. Stop eating garbage, nutrient-depleted processed food.Start filling your body with nutrition while energizing your mind with real, uncensored truth.Must-see infographic: The “Death Science” Depopulation Trifecta … Biological weapons, vaccines and 5G, all aimed at humanity\n",

      "With every tragedy that befalls mankind few political leaders can resist the temptation to enhance the powers of the security state while attacking civil liberties. The response to the coronavirus pandemic has proven to be no exception.Many people are asking, as the Covid lockdown keeps many businesses shuttered: will the economy ever be the same again? No small consideration considering the arbitrary nature of the lockdown, which seems to focus its wrath on small businesses while allowing the major corporations to survive. But there are other serious considerations, like how the media and politicians will hide behind political correctness and virtue signaling to conceal their ulterior motives.\n",
      "One story that nicely encapsulates that agenda is by the BBC, which carried the totally objective headline: ‘Coronavirus: Arrests over ‘disgusting’ racist Covid-19 stickers.’ It is a very simple story that speaks volumes about where we are heading as a civilization. Plot spoiler: to hell in a handbag.The brief article tells the story of two young men, identities unknown, who were arrested for applying stickers in public places. But not just any old stickers. These ones carried the phrases, ‘Open border, virus disorder,’ and ‘Pubs closed, borders open.’ The accused, however, said to be connected to a “far-right” group, were not charged with the relatively minor offense of defacing public property, but rather on “suspicion of racially aggravated public order offences,” whatever those may happen to be.The message is clear: any suggestion that open borders may not be the best idea, even at the peak of a global pandemic, is the wild ranting of a foaming-at-the-mouth xenophobe, as opposed to maybe just a germophobe, and should be immediately vilified and rejected out of hand. In other words, yet more identity politics, enshrined in Cultural Marxist ideology, sets the agenda.Indeed, the severe brevity of the article made it look more like a cheap communist propaganda poster than any work of journalism. The reader is treated to a quote from one Alex Gwynne, who seems to be resident, but that is never disclosed: “Using this pandemic to spread racism and hatred is unacceptable.” Thank you, Alex.Next up is Ben Miskell, a local councilor, who is quoted as saying: “These sorts of things are meant to just divide us … and capitalise on something awful that is happening in Britain for some really sinister aim.”Like perhaps containing the spread of a pandemic that has forced the lockdown of businesses and communities around the world? As to be expected, the article never once attempted to provide some insight into the deep fear and frustration that is gnawing away at so many people in Britain, and elsewhere, as families fear for an uncertain future. While the media obsesses over the coronavirus, the British are forced to watch as thousands of new arrivals enter their country each month. Yet not a peep from the media as to the logic behind such programs amid a pandemic. It is those sorts of deceitful liberal tactics, which discard real concerns over open borders as racist and chauvinistic that will help bring the lockdown pot to a boil.\n",
      "Meanwhile, with borders in the Western becoming practically a synonym for racism, the authorities have taken to the skies to make sure the local herd is complying with social-distancing measures. And reportedly with the assistance of China. All in the name of “protecting lives,” of course.Chinese company Da Jiang Innovations, the world’s largest drone manufacturer, has donated their aerial vehicles to law enforcement agencies in 22 U.S. states in their effort to regulate social distancing rules. Yet, in 2017, the Department of Homeland Security warned that DJI was “selectively targeting government and privately owned entities…to expand its ability to collect and exploit sensitive U.S. data.” This led to the Department of the Interior grounding its fleet of some 800 DJI drones over security fears. Yet when it comes to monitoring Americans, in both public and private settings, not even the sky is the limit.“If these drones save one life, it is clearly worth the activity and the information that the drones are sending,” Chris Bollwage, mayor of Elizabeth, N.J. told MSNBC.Perhaps the operators of those drones have a working relationship with New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who revealed his true colors when he told New Yorkers to squeal on family and friends who break the social-distancing order.“Sending that photo in is going to help make sure that people are kept apart, and that’s going to stop the disease from spreading. And that’s going to save lives,” he said.As proof that humanity has not gone completely to the dogs, the special hotline to accept the photographs was flooded with derogatory pictures and Hitler memes, most of which are too indecent to show, here.Even political protests are no longer happening in a ‘civilized’ manner, at least in Israel, where a demonstration against Benjamin Netanyahu saw participants respecting the 2-meters-apart rule, which made the ‘protest’ resemble some sort of open-air modern art exhibit as opposed to a challenge to the powers-that-be. By necessity, a protest demands that the participants act as a single united force, a throng, if you will.Want to say a pray in a house of worship asking the Almighty to see you through this miserable storm, which appears to have only just begun? Well, that too will prove problematic since in many U.S. states worshipers are no longer permitted to congregate under a single roof, which is strange because liquor stores, gun shops and abortion clinics, not to mention all of the major grocery stores are doing a thriving business despite the inherent risks.What is happening is obvious. Leaders, either by design or otherwise, are taking advantage of the current emergency to ram through draconian measures in the name of “protecting the people.” In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. And with the Western world already softened up with years of political correctness, virtue signaling and the tyrannical nanny state, virile ‘toxic masculinity’ has gone missing in action when it is needed the most. The coronavirus is not the disease that is killing Western civilization; social-distancing and lockdown measures should have been enforced many decades ago when the Cultural Marxists from the Frankfurt School first set foot ashore. That was the moment Western society, set upon itself by a number of divisive and destructive movements, began to crumble to the point when the next flu season may very well consign it to the ash heap of history.COVID-19 Provides Media and Politicians Ground Cover for Destroying Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness\n",

      "The National Institutes of Health has given millions of dollars to scientists studying coronaviruses. That funding didn't cause the COVID-19 pandemic.Right-wing media and conspiracy theorists have seized on a series of grants awarded over the course of six years to study coronaviruses to undermine Dr. Anthony Fauci, the immunologist who’s been at the helm of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984. The narrative moved to the spotlight at the White House when, during a press conference on April 17, a reporter with Newsmax asked President Donald Trump about the grants, totaling $3.7 million since 2014.The Daily Mail, a British tabloid known for publishing unreliable stories, first reported the $3.7 million figure on April 11. The paper wrote a story on the funding, parts of which went to the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China. Although the article stated that there’s no evidence the novel coronavirus leaked from the lab, it implied a correlation between the grants and the pandemic: \"The revelation that the Wuhan Institute was experimenting on bats from the area already known to be the source of COVID-19 — and doing so with American money — has sparked further fears that the lab, and not the market, is the original outbreak source.\"Those questions have had real effects. Politico reported on April 27 that the National Institutes of Health would be revoking grants given to New York–based nonprofit organization EcoHealth Alliance in 2019, including funds for 2020 that the nonprofit now has to return.But in reality, the grants appear to have nothing to do with the coronavirus pandemic. In fact, they were awarded after a different kind of coronavirus — SARS — spread across the world in 2003. The NIH also didn’t give the funds directly to the Wuhan Institute, instead awarding them to EcoHealth Alliance, which invests in health research globally. The money helped support research that led to 20 research papers on coronaviruses published over the six years, according to the NIH. It’s not clear whether Fauci was personally involved in the grants in any way.Aside from the Wuhan Institute, those funds also went to research facilities in Shanghai, Beijing, and Singapore. The grants were meant to “support research that aims to understand what factors allow coronaviruses, including close relatives to SARS, to evolve and jump into the human population and cause disease (called a spillover event),” an NIH spokesperson told BuzzFeed News.“Most emerging human viruses come from wildlife, and these represent a significant threat to public health and biosecurity in the US and globally, as demonstrated by the SARS epidemic of 2002–03, and the current COVID-19 pandemic,” the spokesperson said. “The project includes studying viral diversity in animal (bats) reservoirs, surveying people that live in high-risk communities for evidence of bat-coronavirus infection, and conducting laboratory experiments to analyze and predict which newly discovered viruses pose the greatest threat to human health.”The grant also wasn’t the first awarded to EcoHealth Alliance. The NIH has been funding infectious disease research projects through the nonprofit since 2005.\n",
      "But the Daily Mail failed to note that context, as did the Newsmax reporter, who on April 17 asked Trump: \"There was also another report [saying] that the NIH under the Obama administration in 2015 gave that lab $3.7 million in a grant. Why would the US give a grant like that to China?”Newsmax reporter Emerald Robinson did not return a request for comment.For Joan Donovan, the director of the Technology and Social Change Project at Harvard's Shorenstein Center, the attacks and conspiracies are part of a larger narrative undermining Fauci and his work. “If you don’t trust the scientist, you don’t trust the science,” Donovan said.And the right-wing media and conspiratorial YouTube channels have used the grants to stoke that distrust.On April 26, Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani called for an investigation of the grant on a New York morning radio show. Falsely and without evidence, the former mayor of New York implied the virus was created as a biological weapon, blaming Fauci and the administration of President Barack Obama.“China for the last 10 to 12 years has been carrying on these experiments, including in this Wuhan laboratory, with animals, and actually making this virus more dangerous,” Giuliani said on the show. “You could say that’s for scientific purposes, or you could say that’s for the purpose of weaponizing them.”“'Paid for the Damn Virus That’s Killing Us': Giuliani Rips Fauci Over Grants to Wuhan Laboratory,” said a Washington Examiner headline on April 26, gathering over 150000 Facebook likes, shares, and comments.“Anthony Fauci Should Explain '$3.7 Million to the Wuhan Laboratory'” read a headline in the Washington Times on April 27, which received over 165000 Facebook likes, shares, and comments.Rep. Matt Gaetz and Newsweek may have also perpetuated the falsely shaded narrative, but the most popular piece of content about the grants came from the Next News Network, a YouTube channel known for circulating baseless claims, including a fabricated story about President Bill Clinton sexually assaulting a teenager. Hosted by commentator and conspiracy theorist Gary Franchi, the channel has over a million subscribers and surpassed a billion views in December, according to Forbes.On April 19, the Next News Network posted a video about the grants, which has received over 2.3 million views. In it, osteopath Rashid Buttar drew a direct line between the grant, Fauci, and the pandemic. According to YouTube, the video did not violate the social media company's policies.“Is Fauci directly responsible for this pandemic?” Franchi asked Buttar in the clip.“I’m going to say this: I’ve seen some petitions going around.\" Buttar responded. “I think he’s a criminal. He’s going against the law. He’s going against the government.”Franchi told BuzzFeed News he was asking Buttar \"to clarify his belief that Dr. Fauci’s work with coronaviruses has led to the pandemic.”He added: “The video as a whole revolves around President Trump responding to a reporter that he is investigating the widely reported 3.7 million dollars sent to the Wuhan Lab in 2015 by the NIH to continue coronavirus research after a moratorium was placed on such research in the United States and Dr. Fauci’s involvement with the funding of that research.”In addition to spreading conspiracy theories about the pandemic, Buttar has a history of action taken against him by medical authorities. In 2010, the North Carolina medical board reprimanded him for, among other complaints, three cancer patients who sought treatment from him and paid for treatment that had “no known value for the treatment of cancer.”“Buttar has spent years selling skin drops at $150 a bottle as a treatment for diseases ranging from autism to cancer,” WCNC reported at the time.In 2013, the FDA sent Buttar a warning letter for promoting and distributing unapproved medical products on his websites and Buttar did not respond to a request for comment on his statements about Dr. Fauci.\"The medical board and FDA have a responsibility to make sure doctors don't push too close to the edge,\" he said in an emailed statement to BuzzFeed News. \"The regulatory bodies serve an important function and are needed to safeguard the public.\"Past Coronavirus Research Grants Are Being Used To Smear Anthony Fauci\n",

      "At an emergency meeting in Beijing held last Friday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping spoke about the need to contain the coronavirus and set up a system to prevent similar epidemics in the future.A national system to control biosecurity risks must be put in place “to protect the people’s health,” Xi said, because lab safety is a “national security” issue.Xi didn’t actually admit that the coronavirus now devastating large swaths of China had escaped from one of the country’s bioresearch labs. But the very next day, evidence emerged suggesting that this is exactly what happened, as the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology released a new directive titled: “Instructions on strengthening biosecurity management in microbiology labs that handle advanced viruses like the novel coronavirus.”Read that again. It sure sounds like China has a problem keeping dangerous pathogens in test tubes where they belong, doesn’t it? And just how many “microbiology labs” are there in China that handle “advanced viruses like the novel coronavirus”?It turns out that in all of China, there is only one. And this one is located in the Chinese city of Wuhan that just happens to be … the epicenter of the epidemic.That’s right. China’s only Level 4 microbiology lab that is equipped to handle deadly coronaviruses, called the National Biosafety Laboratory, is part of the Wuhan Institute of Virology.What’s more, the People’s Liberation Army’s top expert in biological warfare, a Maj. Gen. Chen Wei, was dispatched to Wuhan at the end of January to help with the effort to contain the outbreak.According to the PLA Daily, Chen has been researching coronaviruses since the SARS outbreak of 2003, as well as Ebola and anthrax. This would not be her first trip to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, either, since it is one of only two bioweapons research labs in all of China.Does that suggest to you that the novel coronavirus, now known as SARS-CoV-2, may have escaped from that very lab, and that Chen’s job is to try to put the genie back in the bottle, as it were? It does to me.Add to this China’s history of similar incidents. Even the deadly SARS virus has escaped — twice — from the Beijing lab where it was (and probably is) being used in experiments. Both “man-made” epidemics were quickly contained, but neither would have happened at all if proper safety precautions had been taken.\n",
      "And then there is this little-known fact: Some Chinese researchers are in the habit of selling their laboratory animals to street vendors after they have finished experimenting on them.You heard me right.Instead of properly disposing of infected animals by cremation, as the law requires, they sell them on the side to make a little extra cash. Or, in some cases, a lot of extra cash. One Beijing researcher, now in jail, made a million dollars selling his monkeys and rats on the live animal market, where they eventually wound up in someone’s stomach.Also fueling suspicions about SARS-CoV-2’s origins is the series of increasingly lame excuses offered by the Chinese authorities as people began to sicken and die.They first blamed a seafood market not far from the Institute of Virology, even though the first documented cases of Covid-19 (the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2) involved people who had never set foot there. Then they pointed to snakes, bats and even a cute little scaly anteater called a pangolin as the source of the virus.\n",
      "I don’t buy any of this. It turns out that snakes don’t carry coronaviruses and that bats aren’t sold at a seafood market. Neither, for that matter, are pangolins, an endangered species valued for their scales as much as for their meat.The evidence points to SARS-CoV-2 research being carried out at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The virus may have been carried out of the lab by an infected worker or crossed over into humans when they unknowingly dined on a lab animal. Whatever the vector, Beijing authorities are now clearly scrambling to correct the serious problems with the way their labs handle deadly pathogens.China has unleashed a plague on its own people. It’s too early to say how many in China and other countries will ultimately die for the failures of their country’s state-run microbiology labs, but the human cost will be high.But not to worry. Xi has assured us that he is controlling biosecurity risks “to protect the people’s health.” PLA bioweapons experts are in charge.I doubt the Chinese people will find that very reassuring. Neither should we.Steven W. Mosher is the president of the Population Research Institute and the author of “Bully of Asia: Why China’s ‘Dream’ Is the New Threat to World Order.”Don’t buy China’s story: The coronavirus may have leaked from a lab\n",

      "The outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19)Is much too convenient for the Socialist Leftists who would do anything they can to get President Trump out of office. The disease itself originated in Wuhan the capitol of Hubel Province, China in early December 2019 and quickly spread throughout the world in a matter of weeks. The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of the influenza strain that was already a problem in most areas of the world.Many mutated versions of the virus that makes up the non coronavirus influenza has killed more people than COVID-19 thus far and was considered by many experts to be much worse than COVID-19 just a few weeks ago.That was the consensus, until the corrupt World Health Organization labeled COVID-19 a pandemic and much more likely to kill people than the current flu effecting the world.The timing of the COVID-19 outbreak and the negative effect on the world economy is just too convenient to ignore, coming just ahead of the 2020 primary elections.The one thing President Trump has done for the US that cannot be denied by the Socialist Left is build and maintain a fabulous economy and make the US energy independent.An accomplishment that hasn’t been done in many decades.Yet, the number one thing COVID-19 is doing is crashing the stock market, shutting down public events, schools, and having an overall disastrous effect on the economy.Many theorize, COVID-19 is a manufactured germ designed to bring on a worldwide recession, especially here in the US, thus destroying the number one accomplishment of the president.The Nazi nucleus based NWO Socialist movement financed by George Soros, his billionaire buddies and managed by Barack Obama, very well could have brought on this disaster as their nuclear option in getting President Trump out of office.Soros, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland in 2017 vowed to take down President Trump in every way possible. One of his ideas mentioned included crashing the US economy before the 2020 elections.Soros has investments in Wuxi Pharma Tech who has a laboratory in Wuhan.It was obvious from the beginning of this election year that no Democrat running was capable of beating President Trump. Since telling the truth isn’t an attribute the Deep State wants to see in a Democrat candidate, they want Bernie Sanders out to make way for their chosen candidate Joe Biden. Who, by the way is as Deep State as they come.Unfortunately, Biden is not mentally capable of being President as his mental state seems to be deteriorating with each passing day.As it is, he doesn’t even know what city he is speaking in most of the time, what position he is running for, or even know his own wife standing next to him.With this in mind, it isn’t going to be Biden who will be President because he is incapable of doing the job, the person he chooses as his Vice President will be the individual who is actually President.In a few months after getting elected President, if he does, Biden will resign.COVID-19: A Manufactured Virus In A Soros-Owned Lab To Crash The Economy?\n",

      "Clinical trials using high dose vitamin C therapy in China ignored by Western media. New York hospitals now using vitamin C therapy to treat coronavirus patients. Not a day passes without some hyped up media story of how big-pharma is racing to the rescue of humanity with its search for a coronavirus vaccine. There are over 40 companies now searching for a vaccine. Collectively they are spending huge sums of money supported by lavish amounts of tax payer cash. Estimates of how soon a vaccine can be produced vary wildly but most estimates agree that it is unlikely to happen this year. It goes without saying that the first to market with a usable vaccine stands to make billions of dollars.The mainstream media, scientific and political establishments are completely under the spell of big pharma. Governments reassure the public that they’re doing everything in their power to protect them with a variety of measures. These range from mass lock downs and trillion dollar bailouts for big business to limited amounts of helicopter money for the citizens of wealthier countries.Regardless of where you live if you have to go to hospital with symptoms of the coronavirus the key question facing you is: will you be able to leave walking out front door or will you end up being wheeled out the basement back door?The mainstream media in cahoots with governments and the medical establishment are suppressing any news regarding the use of a cheap, safe and easy to produce treatment for coronavirus patients. Maybe its because this treatment is being used in Chinese hospitals to save lives. Let’s face it there has been no let up in Cold War 2.0 during the current pandemic.\n",
      "Dr. Andrew W. Saul, Editor in chief of the Orthomolecular Medicine News Service, sums up the Western big pharma approach nicely when he says:Medical orthodoxy obsessively focuses on searching for a vaccine and/or drug for coronavirus COVID-19). While they are looking for what would be fabulously profitable approaches, we have with vitamin C an existing, plausible, clinically demonstrated method to treat what coronavirus patients die from: severe acute respiratory syndrome, or pneumonia.”On 17 March a group of Chinese physicians held a video conference to discuss the use of high dose intravenous vitamin C for patients with moderate to severe cases of corona virus. The keynote speaker at this meeting was Dr. Enqian Mao, chief of the emergency medicine Department of Ruiijin hospital in Shanghai.Dr Mao is also a senior member of the expert team at the Shanghai Public health Centre, where all coronavirus patients have been treated from the Shanghai area. Dr Mao was also a co-author of the medical protocol for the treatment of coronavirus that has been adopted by the Shanghai Medical Association and the government of Shanghai. This medical protocol also advocates the use of high-dose intravenous vitamin C for the treatment of mild, moderate and severe cases of the coronavirus.Over the last decade Dr Mao has been using high-dose intravenous vitamin C (IVC) to treat patients with a variety of acute medical conditions ranging from pancreatitis and sepsis to surgical wound healing. When the coronavirus epidemic first broke out he and several other colleagues thought that high-dose intravenous C could be a potential treatment for patients presenting with the coronavirus. Their recommendation for the use of high-dose intravenous vitamin C as a treatment was adopted by the Shanghai expert team.Dr. Richard Cheng, an American-Chinese doctor currently based in Shanghai has given a report of this meeting. He notes that:“Dr. Mao stated that his group treated ~50 cases of moderate to severe cases of Covid-19 infection with high dose IVC. The IVC dosing was in the range of 10000 mg – 20000 mg a day for 7-10 days, with 10000 mg for moderate cases and 20000 for more severe cases, determined by pulmonary status (mostly the oxygenation index) and coagulation status. All patients who received IVC improved and there was no mortality. Compared to the average of a 30-day hospital stay for all Covid-19 patients, those patients who received high dose IVC had a hospital stay about 3-5 days shorter than the overall patients. Dr. Mao discussed one severe case in particular who was deteriorating rapidly. He gave a bolus of 50000 mg IVC over a period of 4 hours. The patient’s pulmonary (oxygenation index) status stabilized and improved as the critical care team watched in real time. There were no side effects reported from any of the cases treated with high dose IVC. ”Dr Cheng also reported that he had a separate meeting with Dr. Sheng Wang, Professor of critical medicine of Shanghai’s 10th Hospital, Tongji University College of medicine. At this meeting Professor Weng said that there were several important lessons to be learned from Shanghai’s experience treating patients with the coronavirus. The most important lesson was:“Early and high-dose IVC is quite helpful in helping Covid-19 patients. The data is still being finalized and the formal papers will be submitted for publication as soon as they are complete.”Professor Wang also stated that coronavirus patients displayed a high rate of hyper-coagulability, i.e. an abnormally increased tendency toward blood clotting, which is best treated with heparin.He also stated that it was vitally important for front line medical professionals to, ‘wear protective clothing at the earliest opportunity for intubation and other emergency rescue measures.’ The American health authorities should take notice of this considering that pictures of nurses in New York wearing black plastic refuse sacks have been appearing on social media.Richard Chang has also noted that Professors Mao and Weng have stated that high-dose intravenous vitamin C is being used as a treatment for coronavirus patients in other hospitals around China.Not surprisingly, reports of this cheap, safe treatment, that has been pioneered in China, have been being completely ignored by Western governments and the medical establishments that are beholden to the big pharma approach to the current pandemic.Thankfully, there are doctors in the West who are not blinded by the close minded approach pursued by their governments and so called medical experts. Apparently, doctors at several hospitals in New York, which is the epicentre of the coronavirus epidemic in America, have started to use the pioneering treatments coming out of China.Dr. Andrew G. Weber, a pulmonologist and critical-care specialist affiliated with two Northwell Health facilities on Long Island, has said that coronavirus patients admitted to intensive care immediately receive 1500 mg of intravenous vitamin C. This dosage is then repeated 3-4 times a day.According to Dr. Weber this treatment regime is based upon the experimental use of high-dose vitamin C in Shanghai’s hospitals. He told the New York Post:“The patients who received vitamin C did significantly better than those who did not get vitamin C. It helps a tremendous amount, but it is not highlighted because it’s not a sexy drug.”Apparently, high-dose intravenous vitamin C is been used in hospitals across New York. Sadly, its use appears to be patchy and is dependent upon the whims of individual doctors rather than being part of any systematic medical protocol.As the global death toll soars higher we can only hope that more and more doctors will follow in the footsteps of their Chinese colleagues and have the courage to use a safe and cheap treatment that is totally at odds with the big pharma approach currently followed by the World Health Organisation and most governments. The current approach used by many Western Governments has been slow, clumsy and ill informed putting the interests of big business above saving the lives of ordinary people.WESTERN MEDIA TALKS UP BIG PHARMA’S SEARCH FOR CORONAVIRUS VACCINE WHILE IGNORING USE OF HIGH DOES VITAMIN C TO SAVE LIVES IN CHINA\n",

      "Maximum-security biolab is part of plan to build network of BSL-4 facilities across China.Editors’ note, January 2020: Many stories have promoted an unverified theory that the Wuhan lab discussed in this article played a role in the coronavirus outbreak that began in December 2019. Nature knows of no evidence that this is true; scientists believe the most likely source of the coronavirus to be an animal market.A laboratory in Wuhan is on the cusp of being cleared to work with the world’s most dangerous pathogens. The move is part of a plan to build between five and seven biosafety level-4 (BSL-4) labs across the Chinese mainland by 2025, and has generated much excitement, as well as some concerns.Some scientists outside China worry about pathogens escaping, and the addition of a biological dimension to geopolitical tensions between China and other nations. But Chinese microbiologists are celebrating their entrance to the elite cadre empowered to wrestle with the world’s greatest biological threats.“It will offer more opportunities for Chinese researchers, and our contribution on the BSL‑4-level pathogens will benefit the world,” says George Gao, director of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology in Beijing. There are already two BSL-4 labs in Taiwan, but the National Bio-safety Laboratory, Wuhan, would be the first on the Chinese mainland.The lab was certified as meeting the standards and criteria of BSL-4 by the China National Accreditation Service for Conformity Assessment (CNAS) in January. The CNAS examined the lab’s infrastructure, equipment and management, says a CNAS representative, paving the way for the Ministry of Health to give its approval. A representative from the ministry says it will move slowly and cautiously; if the assessment goes smoothly, it could approve the laboratory by the end of June.\n",
      "BSL-4 is the highest level of biocontainment: its criteria include filtering air and treating water and waste before they leave the laboratory, and stipulating that researchers change clothes and shower before and after using lab facilities. Such labs are often controversial. The first BSL-4 lab in Japan was built in 1981, but operated with lower-risk pathogens until 2015, when safety concerns were finally overcome.The expansion of BSL-4-lab networks in the United States and Europe over the past 15 years — with more than a dozen now in operation or under construction in each region — also met with resistance, including questions about the need for so many facilities.The Wuhan lab cost 300 million yuan (US$44 million), and to allay safety concerns it was built far above the flood plain and with the capacity to withstand a magnitude-7 earthquake, although the area has no history of strong earthquakes. It will focus on the control of emerging diseases, store purified viruses and act as a World Health Organization ‘reference laboratory’ linked to similar labs around the world. “It will be a key node in the global biosafety-lab network,” says lab director Yuan Zhiming.The Chinese Academy of Sciences approved the construction of a BSL-4 laboratory in 2003, and the epidemic of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) around the same time lent the project momentum. The lab was designed and constructed with French assistance as part of a 2004 cooperative agreement on the prevention and control of emerging infectious diseases. But the complexity of the project, China’s lack of experience, difficulty in maintaining funding and long government approval procedures meant that construction wasn’t finished until the end of 2014.The lab’s first project will be to study the BSL-3 pathogen that causes Crimean–Congo haemorrhagic fever: a deadly tick-borne virus that affects livestock across the world, including in northwest China, and that can jump to people.Future plans include studying the pathogen that causes SARS, which also doesn’t require a BSL-4 lab, before moving on to Ebola and the West African Lassa virus, which do. Some one million Chinese people work in Africa; the country needs to be ready for any eventuality, says Yuan. “Viruses don’t know borders.”\n",
      "Gao travelled to Sierra Leone during the recent Ebola outbreak, allowing his team to report the speed with which the virus mutated into new strains1. The Wuhan lab will give his group a chance to study how such viruses cause disease, and to develop treatments based on antibodies and small molecules, he says.The opportunities for international collaboration, meanwhile, will aid the genetic analysis and epidemiology of emergent diseases. “The world is facing more new emerging viruses, and we need more contribution from China,” says Gao. In particular, the emergence of zoonotic viruses — those that jump to humans from animals, such as SARS or Ebola — is a concern, says Bruno Lina, director of the VirPath virology lab in Lyon, France.Many staff from the Wuhan lab have been training at a BSL-4 lab in Lyon, which some scientists find reassuring. And the facility has already carried out a test-run using a low-risk virus.But worries surround the Chinese lab, too. The SARS virus has escaped from high-level containment facilities in Beijing multiple times, notes Richard Ebright, a molecular biologist at Rutgers University in Piscataway, New Jersey. Tim Trevan, founder of CHROME Biosafety and Biosecurity Consulting in Damascus, Maryland, says that an open culture is important to keeping BSL-4 labs safe, and he questions how easy this will be in China, where society emphasizes hierarchy. “Diversity of viewpoint, flat structures where everyone feels free to speak up and openness of information are important,” he says.Yuan says that he has worked to address this issue with staff. “We tell them the most important thing is that they report what they have or haven’t done,” he says. And the lab’s inter­national collaborations will increase openness. “Transparency is the basis of the lab,” he adds.The plan to expand into a network heightens such concerns. One BSL-4 lab in Harbin is already awaiting accreditation; the next two are expected to be in Beijing and Kunming, the latter focused on using monkey models to study disease.Lina says that China’s size justifies this scale, and that the opportunity to combine BSL-4 research with an abundance of research monkeys — Chinese researchers face less red tape than those in the West when it comes to research on primates — could be powerful. “If you want to test vaccines or antivirals, you need a non-human primate model,” says Lina.But Ebright is not convinced of the need for more than one BSL-4 lab in mainland China. He suspects that the expansion there is a reaction to the networks in the United States and Europe, which he says are also unwarranted. He adds that governments will assume that such excess capacity is for the potential development of bioweapons.“These facilities are inherently dual use,” he says. The prospect of ramping up opportunities to inject monkeys with pathogens also worries, rather than excites, him: “They can run, they can scratch, they can bite.”Trevan says China’s investment in a BSL-4 lab may, above all, be a way to prove to the world that the nation is competitive. “It is a big status symbol in biology,” he says, “whether it’s a need or not.”Inside the Chinese lab poised to study world's most dangerous pathogens\n",

And now that we know the guy works for Bill Gates and Big Pharma, the cat is pretty much out of the bag as to his true intentions – but are enough people paying attention?While feigning expertise in the area of virology, Fauci continues to use his platform to push a vaccine on the public that doesn’t even yet exist. Fauci is also vehemently opposed to all other potential treatment options, including inexpensive remedies that already exist and are being used elsewhere in the world with notable success.Fauci would seem to have a vested interest in seeing a Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine not only come to fruition but be the only medical treatment option available to Americans, even though success against the pandemic is already being seen with hydroxychloroquine, for instance, a malaria drug that costs just a few cents per dose.Fauci is so determined to get a Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine launched and spread across the country as quickly as possible that he’s actually now threatening to never let anyone out of their houses ever again unless they agree to get jabbed in accordance with his desires.“When we get back to normal, we will go back to the point where we can function as a society,” Fauci recently stated.But … [i]f you want to get back to pre-coronavirus, that might not ever happen in the sense that the threat is there. But I believe that with the therapies that will be coming online, and the fact that I feel confident that over a period of time we will get a good vaccine, that we will never have to get back to where we are right now.”Be sure to listen below to The Health Ranger Report as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, talks about how we need a national zinc campaign to raise awareness about how this natural mineral can help to stop the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) and end the lockdowns:Fauci is on the Leadership Council of the Gates Foundation’s “Decade of Vaccines” Global Vaccine Action Plan As it turns out, Fauci quietly sits on the Leadership Council of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s Global Vaccine Action Plan, which is currently reaching the finality of its so-called “Decade of Vaccines” initiative that began in 2010. This fully explains why he’s gone all-in for a future Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine, and why he’s signaled that Americans will continue to be held hostage until they agree to get it.Like Gates, Fauci stands to make millions from the release of a Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine, which seems to have been the agenda all along. He probably wasn’t expecting President Trump to ever make any mention of hydroxychloroquine, nor did he anticipate anything other than full compliance from the American people, who’ve been scared to death by this social engineering experiment, also known as 9/11 2.0.But Fauci’s cover has been blown, and everyone who’s paying attention can now see him for the rat he is.

The Russians, for example, have weaponized fentanyl,” he said. But in any event, his comments about it being a potential bioweapon are not the first. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), thinks so too, and for that he is being mocked by the very same mainstream media that lied about the “Trump-Russia collusion” hoax for nearly three years.Specifically, Cotton suggested that the virus originated in China’s only BioLevel 4 research facility — which just happens to be in Wuhan City, the epicenter of the outbreak. And furthermore, Cotton has never said there is 100 percent proof the virus is a bioweapon.Failing to ask this question is the real conspiracy. “We don’t have evidence that this disease originated there,” he said during a recent interview on Fox News, the New York Times reported, “but because of China’s duplicity and dishonesty from the beginning, we need to at least ask the question to see what the evidence says, and China right now is not giving evidence on that question at all.”Mind you, Cotton is a Harvard-educated lawyer and U.S. Army infantry officer with combat experience. He’s not a kook, he’s not a conspiracy theorist, and he’s not some wild-eyed lunatic. The Times jeered: Mr. Cotton later walked back the idea that the coronavirus was a Chinese bioweapon run amok. But it is the sort of tale that resonates with an expanding chorus of voices in Washington who see China as a growing Soviet-level threat to the United States, echoing the anti-Communist thinking of the Cold War era. Right-wing media outlets fan the anger.This, from a newspaper that, again, ‘fanned’ the BS hoax that Moscow and Donald Trump “colluded to steal the election from Hillary Clinton” — for two-plus years. And it was the same paper that repeatedly told readers former special counsel Robert Mueller ‘had proof’ of that hoax — when at the end of his probe, his report said specifically that there was “no evidence” to support the claim.What’s really interesting here is that “mainstream media” outlets like the Times, CNN, The Washington Post, USA Today and others make wild claims about President Trump, and members of his administration, based on less empirical evidence. At least in the case of Cotton and Limbaugh, there is enough circumstantial evidence to warrant suspicions and ask the question: Did the novel coronavirus (as in, this is the first time its been seen) originate from the only lab in China capable of dealing with/handling this type of biohazard? The people who dismiss the question out of hand are the real conspirators.Rush Limbaugh makes obvious point that Wuhan coronavirus might have been a Chinese bioweapon that escaped from the lab\n",

      "The true agenda of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the current White House health advisor offering guidance on the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis, couldn’t be clearer. And let’s just say that this agenda isn’t exactly a good one.The Obama regime leftover, who bragged a few years back that he’s worked in five different White House administrations, doesn’t want people to use hydroxychloroquine to treat the virus. Instead, he wants them to wait for a new “blockbuster” coronavirus vaccine, because that’s what will generate the biggest profits for the pharmaceutical industry.Fauci didn’t actually say this last part, of course, but he didn’t have to. By telling Americans not to look at hydroxychloroquine as a “knockout drug,” but to instead view some theoretical vaccine that doesn’t even exist yet as the “ultimate game changer,” Fauci has exposed himself as the deep state swamp creature that he truly is.“We still need to do the definitive studies to determine whether any intervention, not just this one, is truly safe and effective,” Fauci, who also directs the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), stated to Fox News. “But when you don’t have that information, it’s understandable why people might want to take something anyway even with the slightest hint of being effective.”This sounds like the same nonsense spewed by political hacks in prohibition states who are always calling for “more research” into the safety and effectiveness of cannabis, for instance, in order to “permit” their residents to use it. And the worst part is that there is solid evidence to show that hydroxychloroquine does, in fact, work for coronavirus patients. An international survey of some 6227 doctors in 30 different countries determined that hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine is currently rated as the “most effective therapy” overall when it comes to treating the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), at least when it comes to pharmaceutical interventions.Listen below to The Health Ranger Report as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, talks about how zinc is another effective natural remedy for coronaviruses:Fauci knew Trump would face this coronavirus crisis because it was planned in advance.How we know without a doubt that Fauci is a lying scumbag who’s shilling for Big Pharma is the fact that he spoke about this coronavirus crisis back in 2017, openly admitting that President Trump would be facing a “surprise outbreak” during his presidential term.Somehow, Fauci knew in advance that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) would become a major global pandemic, and is now trying to stop people from using something that works, and instead wait for Bill Gates or whatever other vaccine interests are busily working on them to release vaccines that will supposedly provide a “cure” against this novel virus.Keep in mind that chloroquine tablets currently run about $.04 a dose, or about $1 per course. This is insanely inexpensive, and could easily provide blanket coverage for every person in the world. Meanwhile, a course of remdesivir, a drug that Fauci has personally invested his own money to support trials for, costs upwards of $1000 per course.In other words, Fauci isn’t concerned with helping others. He’s concerned with helping himself and other shareholders who are obviously hoping to profit heavily from the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis due to all of the new “therapeutics” they’re expecting to be unveiled in the coming months.“I think we see who Dr. Fauci is in bed with and it’s not the American people,” wrote one Infowars commenter.“Fauci is nothing more than a modern-day Joseph Mengele,” wrote another. “Experimenting on humans, touting and collaborating with eugenics fanatics, denying empirically effective and inexpensive treatments, Fauci is the 21st century Angel of Death.”Trump’s advisors are pushing coronavirus treatments based on PROFITS, not what works… millions may die to appease Big Pharma’s greed\n",

      "The Coronavirus outbreak in China now dominates worldwide news media outlets. Spiro Skouras released a video yesterday (Jan. 25, 2020) reporting on a 5 hour simulation that was conducted in October of 2019: Event 201. It was hosted by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in partnership with the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The simulation is eerily similar to what is happening right now with the Coronavirus outbreak. Will world health authorities now take action as is predicted in this simulation, and try to control the narrative of the outbreak by cutting off access to the Internet, or forcing social media companies to only allow the information they want the public to receive? Health Impact News is part of the independent alternative media, and sites like ours may soon be blocked from reporting on this emerging worldwide health crisis if this simulation is accurately predicting just how these events are about to unfold. The mainstream media watch-dogs have labeled Health Impact News as “Fake” news, even when we report on vaccine injuries and deaths using the government’s own data. See: In this report we take an inside look at Event 201, which took place in NYC on October 18 2019. Event 201 is a high-level pandemic exercise hosted by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in partnership with the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. This is extremely fascinating because this pandemic simulation exercise of coronavirus took place about 6 weeks before the first illness from the coronavirus was actually reported in Wuhan China! That is one hell of a coincidence if you believe in that sort of thing. Another fascinating connection, is the fact that not only did the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation participate in and help set up the pandemic simulation of a coronavirus outbreak, but they just so happen to fund the group who owns the patent to the deadly coronavirus and are already working on a vaccine to solve the current crisis. Again an incredible coincidence. In this report you will see footage from inside the event as the members of the emergency epidemic board in this simulation, which consists of representatives from major banks, the UN, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Johnson and Johnson, logistical powerhouses, the media as well as officials from China and America’s CDC just to name a few. This simulation also includes news reports that were fabricated just for this exercise, please keep that in mind because they are eerily similar to reports we are currently seeing regarding this real world coronavirus outbreak.

      "During a recent episode of the Thomas Paine Podcast, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. blew the lid on Dr. Anthony Fauci’s extensive legacy of fraud and coverups throughout his lengthy medical career in the federal government.Kennedy explained that Fauci has been a problematic character all throughout his more than 50-year tenure in public health, during which he operated as a workplace tyrant and ruined the careers of countless physicians and researchers who, unlike himself, were upstanding and honorable individuals.Fauci has been with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) since 1984 – can you say deep state? – and he’s known among those on the inside as the guy who “poisoned an entire generation of Americans,” according to Kennedy.In at least one instance, Fauci targeted a whistleblower who was trying to expose the fact that America’s blood supply is tainted with deadly disease strains. Fauci ruined the career of this physician and proceeded to cover up his crucial research on the subject.Kennedy also warned during the program that Fauci has attacked many other good guys who’ve tried to actually serve the public rather than shill for Big Pharma, Bill Gates, the mainstream media and other deep state assets and mouthpieces of deception and lies.The entire Thomas Paine Podcast episode, which is a little more than two-and-a-half hours long, is available at this link.Also, be sure to check out the following episode of The Health Ranger Report in which Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, talks about how globalists like Anthony Fauci are using the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis to test how much tyranny Americans are willing to accept:Anthony Fauci owns “many, many” patents on vaccines, warns Kennedy.Fauci is also guilty of abusing his post for financial gain in the form of obtaining lucrative vaccine patents. Doctors and researchers underneath him who developed breakthrough technologies have been fired so that Fauci could assume ownership of their work in order to enrich himself.“Tony Fauci has many, many vaccine patents,” Kennedy contends, noting that Fauci now owns a patent on a special protein sheet made from HIV that helps to more efficiently deliver vaccine material throughout the body. Fauci didn’t develop this protein sheet himself, of course, but rather stole it from someone else who was relieved from duty after creating it.“Tony Fauci fired [this person] and he somehow ended up owning that patent,” Kennedy says. “And that patent is now being used by some of these companies … to make vaccines for the coronavirus … that company has a 50/50 split with Tony Fauci’s agency … so Fauci’s agency will collect half the royalties on that vaccine and there’s no limit for how much the agency can collect.”In other words, this is nothing but a business for people like Fauci, who are profiting off of pandemics like the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) while claiming to be “regulating” the drug and vaccine industries that respond to them on behalf of the American people.\n",
      "“This isn’t a captured industry; it’s a subsidiary of the pharmaceutical industry,” Kennedy further warns about how the NIAID, the CDC, and other supposed federal agencies are really just corporations in disguise that work on behalf of Big Pharma to generate massive profits on the backs of sick and dying people.You’ll want to listen to the full podcast in its entirety, or at least the second hour-and-a-half of it featuring Robert F. Kennedy Jr., because it’s a real eye-opener. A second source for listening to the podcast, in case the first one doesn’t work, is available at this link.Robert F.

      "The new fifth generation (5G) cellular system that is being installed in major American cities such as Dallas, Atlanta, Waco, Texas, and Sacramento [1, 3] will intensify the microwave radiation health risks for everyone living in those cities.Eleven More Cities Targeted for 5G Deployment this Year.The new 5G cell systems that Verizon and AT&T are planning to install in other cities in 2018 [1, 3] will use shorter length microwaves than the existing 4G (fourth generation) systems. New generation cell phones will be able to communicate with either 5G or 4G microwave towers to optimize connectivity. Copper phone lines will be replaced with 5G rooftop antennas on homes and businesses. These antennas will communicate with 5G cell towers and with the wireless equipment in homes and offices to provide phone and broadband services.5G will be the foundation for the “smart cities” of the future.The Safety of 5G Has Not Been Tested.The microwave frequencies that are being used in this new generation 5G system are in the 1-millimeter wave length.The long-term health risks of these short microwaves have not been adequately tested and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and telecom companies are simply presuming that they are safe based on 1996 research.New Research Reveals Harmful Effects of Cellular Systems. Research on microwave frequency radiation conducted since 1996 shows that the existing 3G and 4G cellular systems are causing serious harm to human health.The 5G systems will increase the level of harm to the level where illness and death can no longer be denied.Harmful Effects are Cumulative.We now know that the development of cancer, heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer’s and numerous other diseases and disabling symptoms are linked to the cumulative effects of microwave radiation.Cellular systems are pushing microwave radiation into our bodies and brains 24 hours a day regardless of whether we use a cell phone or even own one. A Million or More New 5G Towers will be Erected in American Cities. The 5G towers will be spaced approximately 500 feet apart and will be highly visible eyesores.The “small cell” transmitters will be mounted on top of electric utility poles, municipal buildings, schools, and in city parks, on top of street signs, bus shelters, and anywhere else telecom companies wish.n low lying areas they might need to erect new towers that are taller than electric utility poles to accomplish their objectives. Refrigerator size electrical boxes will be attached to each transmission tower. If you happen to be in an area with underground electric service, then they will erect new towers that use the underground electrical lines.If you live or work in a densely populated area where electrical poles are very close to buildings, then you might have a 5G cell tower located a few feet from your place of employment or your bedroom. It is estimated that the daily microwave exposure generated by the 5G system will be equivalent to living inside a microwave oven and turning it up to high and baking yourself for 19 minutes a day.Telecom Companies Hold the Upper Hand on 5G Tower Placement. FCC regulations [11] make it illegal for government entities to try to delay or stop cell tower installation on the basis of health risks.Telecom companies can sue cities and states that attempt to use health concerns to impede their cell tower building plans.\n",

Can We Stop It?The remainder of this article provides detailed information about the health risks of 5G and explains why the public and government entities cannot stop the rapid build-out of the 5G system despite the massive health risks.It will link you to efforts in your state where telecom companies are seeking to enact legislation that will strip away all rights to object to cell tower placement on any basis.My previous articles on microwave radiation dangers will provide background information to those who are not familiar with this topic.

RRT, which is a trusted and leading UK group dedicated to education about wireless radiation health effects, has been receiving emails and phone calls from parents, school children and teachers asking RRT to respond to the article.The letter was written by RRT’s Chairwoman, Eileen O’Connor, and the group’s US based advisor, Susan Foster, and responds to the unsubstantiated and false claims by First News of the absolute safety of 5G. The letter provides ample scientific evidence of proven harms by wireless radiation and addresses how Big Telecom is defrauding the public.“The RRT believes that it is one thing to comfort children with respect to the lockdown and the corona virus,” said Ms. O’Conner, “but not at the cost of the truth about the very real harms from these dangerous exposures.”Since 5G infrastructure is based primarily on 4G, and on pulsed and modulated radio and microwave frequencies that have been proven harmful in thousands of studies, harms that have been confirmed by courts around the world, there is no doubt that 5G is harmful as well.“Children need to be told the truth: cell phones and cell towers emit radiation,” commented Ms. Foster. “It is ludicrous and shameful to tell children that a great deal of research has been done to prove 5G safe when decades of science on the biological effects of electromagnetic radiation have proven it harmful.”RFK, Jr., Dafna Tachover and CHD are calling for the protection of those who have already been harmed by wireless technology radiation, including many children, and for the prevention of further and imminent harm by halting 5G deployment.5G deployment is exponentially increasing our exposure to this harmful radiation and technology. Of special concern is the installation of cell phones antennas in close proximity to people’s homes and children’s bedrooms. As a result, growing numbers of countries and municipalities around the world have banned the deployment of 5G.Children’s Health Defense joined this effort as it is aligned with the organization’s mission to protect children from environmental toxins. 5G and wireless radiation constitute toxins which are significantly involved in the increase of sickness in children. Sadly, in the UK, a 15 y/o girl, Jenny Fry committed suicide after becoming sick from wireless and as a result of the mistreatment she has experienced because of her sickness.RFK, Jr., Dafna Tachover and CHD are calling for the protection of those who have already been harmed by wireless technology radiation including many children, and for the prevention of further and imminent harm by halting 5G deployment.RFK, Jr. Joins EM Radiation Research Trust in Calling Upon UK Prime Minister to Halt 5G Deployment\n",

      "On the evening of Saturday, April 18, 2020, the forty thousandth (40000) “presumed COVID 19 death,” according to new CDC guidelines occurred.Where death only affects the few, the misinformation, withheld or suppressed data, the lies, the propaganda and censorship are making things worse.Thus, we turn to the format of a loose intelligence briefing as the infectious nature of propaganda has to be resisted and it is so very hard to resist.On the morning of Sunday, April 19, 2020 a propaganda blitzkrieg began, using Trump administration surrogates, claiming the deaths are really “fake people” and “empty hospitals.”We might call this “pandemic denial,” made dangerous as the pandemic, as of mid-late April 2020 is clearly in control and those claiming otherwise are knowingly lying for reasons we will make clear.Major medical centers across the US are at an average of 80% of capacity. Some are higher, much higher. In some areas temporary hospitals are being used but more often non-COVID patients are being “turfed” to rural medical centers where their needs may not be properly addressed.As with any emergency, the first victim is truth. Social media lends itself toward sensationalism and can attract those with victimization fantasies. Thus, only information from known sources is accepted and nothing from mainstream or social media can be trusted.The situation in American hospitals, not all but more than the public would imagine, is grave. Currently, PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) is in good supply with the exception of N95 masks and that situation is rapidly improving.Availability of ventilators in the US is currently very good, thanks to individuals like Elon Musk, the governments of Russia and China and many charitable organizations that have gone to great efforts.By “very good” we are speaking of supplies as predictive modeling indicates. One of the problems, however, is that the predictive models are predicated on assumptions not in evidence and are failing. This critical failure, and the cloak of secrecy around it, has given rise to the lunacy and subterfuge we are seeing in Washington.Part of that failure is at hospital level.To clarify, the issue is getting patents off ventilators. Nearly half of those on ventilators now are at or above 10 days and face a poor outcome. Claims that half may die are low. Most or all will die unless a late stage treatment protocol is developed in time.This is a life and death race and we are losing.Moreover, many patients who are never intubated but stay on cannula for oxygen, as we are told was the case with Boris Johnson, seem to recover then quickly succumb for no apparent reason.Johnson likely received Remdesivir, which has been denied other NHS patients. If so, the political fallout for Johnson, whose policies left the NHS grossly unprepared for the COVID 19 pandemic, will and should be catastrophic.The biggest morbidity factors are the following:Age (60 plus).Obesity. Smoking. Diabetes. Any other cardiopulmonary issues. The glaring question of irregular morbidity figures must be addressed. This is what we have learned:The healthcare systems of Italy and Spain were very much “not as represented.” Claims that the hospitals of Northern Italy, in particular, are among the “best in the world” is patently false. Were it not for Russian and Chinese aid, both Italy and Spain would have collapsed. Standards of care considered “normal” in Britain, France, Belgium, Spain and Italy rate at or below the worst in the US.That said, with massive medical infrastructure, the US was blindsided as well. Twenty percent of COVID 19 victims are healthcare professionals. Past that, vital support personnel for health care are primarily African American or Hispanic.This has given rise to issues of specific genetic vulnerabilities which are likely at this point overemphasized. Households with healthcare and support workers most often have one or more adults working away from home, often in areas of very high exposure.Past this we look at Iran, hard hit early on. If figures are to be believed, Iran peaked on March 29, 2020 and is showing a steady decline in new patients barring a second wave. Iran’s testing program has been more aggressive than most and if these figures are reliable, they offer some hope to nations, unlike the United States, that took the threat seriously.The material offered here is an intelligence briefing on a vital situation. The US government is keeping secret, even from state governors, the real situation with the COVID 19 pandemic, as a first wave, ending many lockdowns, by May 1, 2020 is planned.There is nothing worse than an election year in the United States, nothing worse except, maybe, an election year with a nation fully engaged in not just a pandemic but economic collapse as well.Never has the very real threat of extremism and totalitarianism been this close for the United States. We will be addressing this issue, the failure of governance but also the “elephant in the room,” how the lockdowns themselves are a panacea.Our models are failing, based on mixed data on acquired immunity.  We have had several reports this week that reinfection rates are high, particularly from South Korea.By the first week of February, the US had reached one of two scenarios, that could have only been mitigated by a quick vaccine, not possible, and assumptions on immunity that were not evidence based:Where a 10 lockdown would have applied on February 1, a two-month lockdown from mid-March to mid-May is likely to lead to waves of reinfection, through September.  Lockdown beyond that would do nothing and economic factors dictate opening up, taking the extinction level hit, to an unimaged level.\n",
      "This scenario advocates a May 1 end to lockdown, if continued reliable reinfection reports come in, which is likely to give us a “wash through” lasting until February 2021.Option 2 is most likely and may well be inexorable, a “wash through” combined with waves of reinfection.  New treatment protocols, and there few showing promise, would be the priority.  Generally, Hydroxychloroquine/Chloroquine is facing a dim future.  Side effects are devastating, and effectiveness has, thus far, been in only moderate cases and anecdotal.Convalescent serum is at an experimental stage and weeks from deployment. Initial tests show it to be useful in a percentage of cases with the following caveat, patients thus far either improve quickly or die of a reaction to the serum.This information is being withheld.We have promising antivirals, but these have only been used in non-defining test situations that, out of humanitarian concerns, do not have a double-blind.We are hopeful.Saying we have reached an ‘end of the world as we know it’ has both good and bad connotations.  Large military forces are no longer in the cards for the major powers.  It has been proven how easy it is to take a ship at sea down.There are so many ways to target infections to diminish military capability, there is now a weapon that makes any state a major player again, and the US is entirely to blame with their massive biological weapon research program.  You see, the US allowed the program to filter into the universities for ‘cover” as numerous treaties are being violated.  Every president since and including Clinton has a hand in this.Bush 41 tried to stop this and this and other reasons were why his presidency was ended, a story that will never be told.  Bush learned early about the planning of 9/11 and watched Clinton increasingly lose control of the reins as right wing extremist elements in Washington partnered with rogue elements in the Pentagon, CIA and the criminal elites of the former Soviet Union, soon to make up the core of the Kosher Nostra crime syndicate.Trump’s handling of this issue, if one is to assume his blunder was unintended, is the single biggest failure of governance in American history.While covering his tracks, working with organized crime to foster internal rebellion, wrongly targeting China and continually diminishing the presidency, a wave of damage that may eventually be more costly than the pandemic itself has been fomented.Oil will never be the same.  Fracking will never be profitable, current pipelines and refineries under construction are now useless as are those built in recent years, many at incredible cost to the environment.Russia’s moves into the Arctic are now likely to be curtailed.A good example will be Norway.  Their GDP for the next 48 months, even without a permanent market contraction, will be down by 15% with exports down 40% or a bit more.They will move from a social welfare state with a very high standard of living to a debtor nation in less than 5 years.This is a best-case scenario for the wealthiest of nations.Saudi Arabia is entering uncharted waters.  Clearly, Saudi Arabia and the UAE will end their issues with Iran. From Press TV:“A Saudi whistleblower has said that the number of Saudi royals infected with the coronavirus (COVID-19) has “exceedingly surpassed” figures previously revealed by a New York Times report.The Saudi al-Ahd al-Jadid Twitter account made the revelations on Friday, more than a week after the NYT report said as many as 150 Saudi royals had contracted the virus.The report at the time said that over 500 beds were being prepared at the elite King Faisal Specialist Hospital that treats members of the Saudi family.On Friday, however, al-Ahd al-Jadid, which is known for whistleblowing on high-profile cases within the Saudi court, revealed that the Saudi hospital reserved for the royals in the Red Sea port city of Jeddah had been overwhelmed with coronavirus cases.“The Jeddah specialist hospital, which is reserved for Saudi royals, is no longer capable of accepting new cases,” the Twitter account said.“Therefore, two hotels have been reserved to be fully used for accommodating and curing infected royals,” it added, naming one of the hotels as being the “Movenpick Hotel”.As of 1400 GMT on Friday, more than 7142 confirmed coronavirus cases were reported in the kingdom, with 87 deaths, according to a Reuters tally.Another Saudi whistleblower, Mujtahid, however, has cast doubt on official figures, arguing that the situation throughout the kingdom is much more critical.The reports of the COVID-19 disease spreading among royals come as the Saudi family is embroiled in a bitter power struggle between Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and his potential rivals, according to reports.”Nations like Iraq have been, thus far, exceptionally effective in limiting the spread of the pandemic. Their last case was on April 16, 2020 and thus far register only 82 deaths with over 500 active patients.Turkey is reporting a possible downturn, as of April 14, with new cases peaking a few days earlier at around 4500 new cases a day. Turkey, however, has nearly 80000 active patients and has been accused of significant underreporting.Russia’s COVID 19 surge began in April but cases are a small fraction of what the US is seeing with a mortality rate, based on official reports, half of that in the US.Conclusion. COVID 19, a disease that many experts weren’t expecting for a hundred thousand years, is a highly modified version of the Wuhan Horseshoe Bat Virus. It is not plausible that COVID 19 developed without a gene-splicing laboratory. The odds against such a disease developing naturally are astronomical yet we are continually informed of the opposite.In order to prepare this, front line medical personnel were interviewed, even interrogated to an extent, within parameters of required tenets of patient privacy laws. The truth, the horror of the truth, is worse than the dramatic twitter video. We are asking too much of far too few and this should never be allowed to happen again.We have turned medical personnel/first responders into “cannon fodder.”The Geopolitical Consequences of COVID-19: Over the Cliff\n",

      "Those who have read Naomi Klein’s seminal book The Shock Doctrine will remember how the ‘short sharp shock’ (primarily economic) was the tool fashioned by the Chicago School of Economics in order to create regime change in countries that resisted US hegemonic power grabs in the 1980s and 1990s.This neocolonial heist was administered to a number of South American countries, in the Middle East and also in Eastern Europe, where, in 1989, Poland’s Solidarity movement was undermined by the Chicago School’s Jeffrey Sachs posing as a libertarian anti-communist bringer of gifts from the West.A poisoned chalice, as it turned out, as Sachs infiltrated the hugely popular worker-led new political movement known as The Third Way and landed Poland with a draconian IMF loan whose repayment terms wrecked the country’s industrial base.A very similar scenario was repeated in Greece whose people are still struggling at the hands of the same treatment meated-out by The European Commission, the IMF and the European Central Bank, collectively known as The Troika.\n",
      "Now ‘The Shock Doctrine’ is back with us again – with a vengeance. But this time it’s not just a national shock prescription, but a global one, executed on the concocted premise of a dangerous virus which is purported to have escaped from a laboratory in Wuhan, China, at the turn of the year.\n",
      "The first move of this latest attempted grand heist has been to get around half the population locked-down in their own homes and induced into a state of fear paralysis. A formula that is activated by the ‘instructed’ mainstream media spreading a panic-warning of said virus spooking its way into all avenues of life and causing some form of untreatable sickness.The effectiveness of this fear-based indoctrination programme has been remarkable. A recent national opinion poll conducted in the UK suggests that more than 60% of the British public – believing what they are hearing and consequently suffering the Covid fear symptoms – do not want the lockdown measures to be lifted or even eased. This might be explained by the fact that the BBC – a masterful spreader of political disinformation – is regarded by many in the UK as ‘god’, followed closely by the Queen, on whose estate the Pirbright Institute is housed, a Coronavirus patent is officially registered and a Covid-19 vaccine is being developed.The tactics currently being deployed rely upon deliberate deception, preplanned social engineering and applied behavioural psychology being trained on great swathes of the world population via a completely compliant media which works hand in hand with a corporate/banker/political cabal whose sights are set on nothing less than totalitarian control of all avenues of human society as well as of the human brain.As long as actions taken in relation to the grand Covid scam can continue to be sold as a genuine attempt to protect citizens, rather than screw them, the lockdown can be largely kept in place, enabling the implementation of a rapid desecration of the fundamental constitutional rights of citizens living in what are claimed to be ‘democratic’ countries.But as soon as a critical mass see through the veil and cease to buy the lie, the tables will be turned; an event likely to lead to a showdown between a steadily emerging recognition of truth and a rapidly fracturing ‘fortress lie’. Our job at this moment of time is to catalyse this process.Notwithstanding the fact that any and all preventable premature deaths carry with them a real sense of loss, the outrageous absurdity of pretending that the release of a virus recognised to be a strain of common flu, should constitute a valid reason for wrecking billions of people’s lives and income sources, from one end of the world to the other, has got to be revealed for what it is: an act of preplanned genocide.Enough time has passed and enough evidence accrued to know that the death toll ascribed to Covid-19 – as farcically imprecise as the statistics are – is less than the average loss of life brought about by the standard annual winter flu cycle in Northern hemisphere countries – and just a fraction of the deaths resulting from cancer, heart disease and the other major sicknesses to which modern man typically succumbs.So instead of pouring over oceans of epidemiological evidence as though training to acquire a PhD in virology, we need to turn to face the enemy and take direct action to halt the advance of the lie machine. Studying the small details of exactly what forms the constituent parts of this particular strain of sickness, is a deviation we cannot afford to indulge in. Let specialist doctors get on with this; but let the rest of us jump to our feet and slam closed the oak door that protects our most fundamental freedoms from being eviscerated right in front of our eyes.Doctors, recognising that they are being deeply misled about the nature of this so called ‘pandemic’ must refuse to go along with the lies. They should form their own informal committees in which to share their knowledge and help those in need using best practices and common sense. Thousands are in danger of breaking the Hippocratic Oath by following directives that defy logic and rational thought.\n",
      "Within the legal profession, let all those who retain some human judgement demand that an immediate emergency injunction be tabled in the high court of law in their country; leading to a court order being issued against all attempts to change national constitutions and other legal acts ‘on the hoof’ without any proper debate or opportunity for those under attack to put their case and defend their lawful rights.Let all those who work in communications and media recognise that they carry a moral and ethical responsibility to do more than simply pass on a purely superficial repetition of what it is they are on hand to report. All too often journalists today act like robots – without ever exploring and reporting on the deeper issues that lie behind significant news events. Editors are equally culpable, if not more so. Both tend to land-up as hired hands to billionaires and bought-out governments.May such individuals now wake-up to the realisation that they have a duty to inform the general public of whether those whose statements they report are acting in the interests or in abuse of the health and welfare of the greater public they are supposed to serve.Journalists of all descriptions have a vital role to perform at this time. If acting responsibly means getting kicked-out of one’s job – so be it – one will at least regain a blessedly clear conscience and win the opportunity to club together with other members of the resistance, to form real and much needed new avenues of independent communication, thereby conveying words of enlightenment rather than being complicit in the further dumbing-down of fellow human beings.\n",

      "A former American counter-terrorism specialist and military intelligence officer of the CIA has said that the “Coronavirus did not occur naturally through mutation but rather was produced in a laboratory, possibly as a biological warfare agent.”Since the novel coronavirus outbreak began in China last December, it has infected more than 90000 people globally and killed more than 3000. The majority of cases and deaths remain in mainland China.The death toll from the coronavirus in Iran, which has one of the highest numbers outside China, stood at 107, Health Ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur said Thursday.“Several reports suggest that there are components of the virus that are related to HIV that could not have occurred naturally. If it is correct that the virus had either been developed or even produced to be weaponized it would further suggest that its escape from the Wuhan Institute of Virology Lab and into the animal and human population could have been accidental. Technicians who work in such environments are aware that “leaks” from laboratories occur frequently,” Philip Giraldi wrote in an article published by the Strategic Culture Foundation on Thursday.“There is, of course and inevitably, another theory. There has been some speculation that as the Trump Administration has been constantly raising the issue of growing Chinese global competitiveness as a direct threat to American national security and economic dominance, it might be possible that Washington has created and unleashed the virus in a bid to bring Beijing’s growing economy and military might down a few notches. It is, to be sure, hard to believe that even the Trump White House would do something so reckless, but there are precedents for that type of behavior,” he said.“In 2005-9 the American and Israeli governments secretly developed a computer virus called Stuxnet, which was intended to damage the control and operating systems of Iranian computers being used in that country’s nuclear research program. Admittedly Stuxnet was intended to damage computers, not to infect or kill human beings, but concerns that it would propagate and move to infect computers outside Iran proved to be accurate as it spread to thousands of PCs outside Iran, in countries as far flung as China, Germany, Kazakhstan and Indonesia,” he added.“If one even considers it possible that the United States had a hand in creating the coronavirus at what remains of its once extensive biological weapons research center in Ft Detrick Maryland, it is very likely that Israel was a partner in the project. Helping to develop the virus would also explain how Israeli scientists have been able to claim success at creating a vaccine so quickly, possibly because the virus and a treatment for it were developed simultaneously,” he noted.Coronavirus was produced in a laboratory: Former CIA intel officer\n",

      "\n",
      "Now let's back up a bit. Why would anyone think that vitamin C might be effective in treating this terrible virus? Vitamin C is an essential nutrient, and we all need it, but most people get plenty of vitamin C in their normal diet. As I've written before, taking vitamin C supplements is unnecessary but probably harmless, although megadoses carry the risk of kidney stones.The modern craze with vitamin C started with Linus Pauling, a brilliant chemist and a Nobel Prize winner. Late in his career, he wrote a book promoting vitamin C as a miracle cure for many illnesses, including the common cold (which is caused by a virus). He had very little good evidence for this belief, but his promotion of vitamin C led to hundreds of studies testing his hypothesis. The bottom line: vitamin C doesn't work at preventing or curing the common cold. (See Paul Offit's book if you want more details on this and many other \"miracle\" cures.)\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, someone might object: haven't some of those vitamin C studies (as in this review paper) shown a benefit against the common cold? Well yes, but when you run hundreds of studies of a treatment that doesn't work, this is what happens: negative studies are hard to get published, but positive studies are easier. Run enough studies, and a few of them, merely by chance, will show a small positive effect. That's what we've seen with vitamin C.Today, though, everyone is looking for a cure for COVID-19, and not surprisingly, many people (even some doctors) are claiming vitamin C is the answer. I've seen Twitter users explain, very confidently, that you just need to take 12000 mg of vitamin C and you'll get better. This website comes right out and states that high-dose vitamin C will cure coronavirus, based on a widely-shared video from a doctor in China. (I won't provide the link because it has already done enough damage.)\n",

      "It's almost impossible to disprove a claim that a treatment works. For example, I could claim that ginger snap cookies help to prevent coronavirus infection. That's right! Ginger snaps, made with real ginger, which seems to have magical curative properties. If you object, I could demand that you prove me wrong–but the onus is on me, as the one making the claim, to first provide some genuine evidence. We haven't seen anything like that for vitamin C.\n",
      "\n",
      "We need well-controlled experiments to know with any confidence that a treatment works. Some doctors at Wuhan University have started a trial of vitamin C to see if it has any benefits for COVID-19, but results won't be available for many months. I'm skeptical, but at least they're approaching the question the right way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dozens of studies of new treatments for COVID-19 are being launched right now, with remarkable speed due to the urgency of the pandemic.The WHO has just launched trials of the 4 most promising existing drugs (which don't include vitamin C, I should add). To obtain a believable, positive result, we need to see evidence that a carefully administered treatment provides a significant benefit over what we're doing now–which is little more than supportive care, unfortunately.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, we'll have to wait and hope that one of the plausible efforts currently under way will yield an effective treatment.

      "Chinese scientists believe the deadly coronavirus may have started life in a research facility just 300 yards from the Wuhan fish market.\n",
      "A new bombshell paper from the Beijing-sponsored South China University of Technology says that the Wuhan Center for Disease Control (WHCDC) could have spawned the contagion in Hubei province. 'The possible origins of 2019-nCoV coronavirus,' penned by scholars Botao Xiao and Lei Xiao claims the WHCDC kept disease-ridden animals in laboratories, including 605 bats.  It also mentions that bats - which are linked to coronavirus - once attacked a researcher and 'blood of bat was on his skin.' The report says: 'Genome sequences from patients were 96% or 89% identical to the Bat CoV ZC45 coronavirus originally found in Rhinolophus affinis (intermediate horseshoe bat).'  It describes how the only native bats are found around 600 miles away from the Wuhan seafood market and that the probability of bats flying from Yunnan and Zhejiang provinces was minimal. In addition there is little to suggest the local populace eat the bats as evidenced by testimonies of 31 residents and 28 visitors. Instead the authors point to research being carried out withing a few hundred yards at the WHCDC. One of the researchers at the WHCDC described quarantining himself for two weeks after a bat's blood got on his skin, according to the report. That same man also quarantined himself after a bat urinated on him. And he also mentions discovering a live tick from a bat - parasites known for their ability to pass infections through a host animal's lood. 'The WHCDC was also adjacent to the Union Hospital (Figure 1, bottom) where the first group of doctors were infected during this epidemic.' The report says. 'It is plausible that the virus leaked around and some of them contaminated the initial patients in this epidemic, though solid proofs are needed in future study.' And as well as the WHCDC, the report suggests that the Wuhan Institute of Virology could also have leaked the virus, as has previously been reported by MailOnline. 'This laboratory reported that the Chinese horseshoe bats were natural reservoirs for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) which caused the 2002-3 pandemic,' the report says. 'The principle investigator participated in a project which generated a chimeric virus using the SARS-CoV reverse genetics system, and reported the potential for human emergence 10. A direct speculation was that SARS-CoV or its derivative might leak from the laboratory.' The report concludes that 'the killer coronavirus probably originated from a laboratory in Wuhan.' It comes as the outbreak has infected more than 69000 people globally, with 1665 deaths in China - most of these in the central province of Hubei. Did coronavirus originate in Chinese government laboratory? Scientists believe killer disease may have begun in research facility 300 yards from Wuhan wet fish market\n",

      "With over 11000 deaths and more than 100000 cases of Covid-19, Italy is currently a country which feels under siege. But this is no impediment to the think tank racket twisting an offer of support for its propaganda purposes.Here's what happened. The weekend before last, Vladimir Putin called Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. During the conversation, Conte asked for help, in fighting coronavirus, according to the Kremlin readout which hasn't been contradicted by Italian officials.Let's be clear from the outset, there was undoubtably a strong PR, as well as practical, element to Russia's assistance. However, there were also advantages to Rome from this approach, as the move may have helped to concentrate a few minds among its traditional allies.Moscow sent teams of \"doctors, protective gear and medical equipment\" to the stricken country. The detail included 100 military virologists and epidemiologists, along with eight medical teams, according to Russian news outlets. Most importantly, it delivered 600 ventilators.A significant amount given Italy apparently had only about 5000 of the devices. Indeed, a few days after the Putin/Conte call, the New York Times was writing about Italy's \"ventilator crisis.\"There's usually nothing like a bit of Russian influence to jolt EU and NATO elites into action. As mentioned above, no doubt this was also part of Conte's reasoning. That said, it's also worth mentioning that some other Europeans states have tried to help the Italians. Germany and France, in particular, took patients and sent supplies, despite dealing with outbreaks of their own. Yet, many in Italy feel they haven't done enough.Putin was also surely thinking ahead to a post-coronavirus crisis time when Italians will remember who stood by them in their hour of need. Especially given Italy is now the third most powerful country in a European Union which has Russia under sanctions.Indeed as the Diplomatic Editor of BBC’s newsnight, Mark Urban, noted “Russia and China have sent help to Italy. You might argue it’s not huge in scale and given for political reasons. But when Italians remember this crisis and wonder what the US did for them at this hour of need…” Urban is a vocal Russia critic and hardly a Kremlin patsy.A few days after the aid landed, a campaign began on Twitter to discredit the Russian initiative. The first I saw of it was a tweet from Oliver Carroll, of London’s Independent newspaper, who presumably speaks Italian (I don’t, so I am relying on his translation).“Some Italians are expressing unease about Putin's Covid-19 emergency aid,” he wrote. “Acc(ording) to La Stampa, 80 percent of supplies (are) “useless,\" (and) sources worry about high-ranking military officers now in (the) country. Russian soldiers (are) free to roam (in) Italy a few steps away from NATO,” the paper stated.La Stampa says China sent masks (and) ventilators; (but) Russia sent irrelevant equipment used for bacteriological and chemical outbreaks,” Carroll added. “(There is a) belief that Russia … (is) not helping us only for great goodness of its people... now beginning to circulate in broad sectors, military and political.”\n",
      "The newspaper's report seemingly relied on the testimony of an anonymous source, who did not give their name. Thus, we have to take the author's word for it.However, the same day, Italy’s Ambassador to Moscow had a rather different point-of-view. “Pasquale Terracciano thanked Russia for its assistance in the fight against novel coronavirus, adding that the humanitarian aid to his country included about 600 medical ventilators,” reported the TASS news agency. It then quoted Terracciano as saying \"it is very important that all this medical equipment includes 600 ventilators, which are critically important at this stage of the epidemic.\"\n",
      "Meanwhile, the President of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, openly dismissed La Stampa’s report. \"I say thanks to the Russians who sent us doctors and other people who can help with disinfection,\" he told an online press conference. Lombardy is the Italian region most affect by the Covid-19 crisis.“The Russian Federation has sent face masks, ventilators and medical staff and teams to disinfect public buildings and our cities,” Italian Foreign Minister Di Maio said. “They have helped in their own way in an act of solidarity.”As you can see, those entitled to speak for Italy seem to be pretty grateful for Moscow's aid. Nevertheless, predictably, 'Atlanticists' weren't happy. Despite the fact that Trump's America has been about as useful to Europe in this emergency as a wetsuit in the desert. Eto Buziashvili of NATO's Atlantic Council adjunct wrote on Twitter that \"80% of the Covid-19 supplies supplies that Russia has sent to Italy are useless,\" citing La Stampa. Her Twitter biography, by the way, claims she's an expert in 'disinformation.'Next up was Olga Tokariuk, who writes for Atlantic Council as well as a Kiev-based news site, Hromadske, which is bankrolled by the local US embassy. \"According to La Stampa sources in the Italian military, 80% of items they [the Russians] brought are useless,\" she tweeted. This was shared over 600 times.\"Italy recently reported that 80% of Russian aid against #Covid_19 is useless,\" wrote Dionis Cenusa. He also pens articles for, you guessed it, the Atlantic Council. His intervention was retweeted by more than 400 accounts. Also, note that he says \"Italy recently reported,\" not La Stampa.I decided to ask Cenusa a perfectly reasonable question. \"[Do] you think \"Italy\" is an anonymous commenter to a single newspaper, and that person (assuming they even exist) has more right to speak for Italy (even though they won't even give their name) than the ambassador to Moscow or the President of Lombardy. Yes? For real?\"Rather than answer, his response was to block me. Which speaks volumes for how the think tank disinformation racket works.One of Atlantic Council's more high profile lobbyists, Michael Weiss, also joined in. The 'fellow' noted how \"80% of Russian coronavirus aid to Italy is useless, apparently.\"What's most interesting here the fact that so many of the people pushing the disinformation are connected to the pro-NATO pressure group. Not to mention the fact that they used almost the same form of words. Was this coordination, or coincidence?Circling back to the original La Stampa piece, it seemed logical to check whether the reporter had any think tank links himself. Not surprisingly, it turns out Jacopo Iacoboni has also written for the Atlantic Council. He most notably assisted Alina Polyakova with a 2017 report dubbed 'The Kremlin's Trojan Horses.' This hit job smeared numerous Italian public figures — such as politician's Beppe Grillo and Matteo Salvini — as effectively operating as proxies for Moscow.\n",
      "Polyakova has since been appointed to run CEPA, a lobby firm, masquerading as a think tank. It's raison d'être to promote NATO's role in Eastern Europe. To this end, it's funded by American and British weapons manufacturers which have profited from the US-led alliance's expansion. It turns out Iacoboni's anti-Russia credentials are quite well known. Indeed, they have even been endorsed by the Intregity Initiative. In case you have forgotten, this was a British government funded undercover \"information wars\" effort which didn't stay secret for very long.The Integrity Initiative included him in its list of people in particular countries its organizers felt they could use to run anti-Russian coverage. This is not to imply Iacoboni knew he was he being considered by the British for such operations, but it does mean they regarded him as reliably anti-Russian. Which tells its own tale.The La Stampa story, based on anonymous sources, which may or may not be legitimate, was a curious intervention at a time when Italy is on its knees. It's quite instructive that the think tank crowd, most notably those from Atlantic Council who rarely show any interest in Italian affairs, jumped on it. As is the author's own association with the pro-NATO institution.

      "Bill Gates Vaccines are strategic philanthropy that feeds his many vaccine-related businesses (including Microsoft’s ambition to control a global vaccination ID enterprise) and gives him dictatorial control of global health policy.Gates’ obsession with vaccines seems to be fueled by a conviction to save the world with technology.Promising his share of $450 million of $1.2 billion to eradicate Polio, Gates took control of India’s National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI) which mandated up to 50 doses (Table 1) of polio vaccines through overlapping immunization programs to children before the age of five. Indian doctors blame the Gates campaign for a devastating non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP) epidemic that paralyzed 490000 children beyond expected rates between 2000 and 2017. In 2017, the Indian government dialed back Gates’ vaccine regimen and asked Gates and his vaccine policies to leave India. NPAFP rates dropped precipitously.In 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) reluctantly admitted that the global explosion in polio is predominantly vaccine strain. The most frightening epidemics in Congo, Afghanistan, and the Philippines, are all linked to vaccines. In fact, by 2018, 70% of global polio cases were vaccine strain.South African newspapers complained, “We are guinea pigs for the drug makers.” Nelson Mandela’s former Senior Economist, Professor Patrick Bond, describes Gates’ philanthropic practices as “ruthless and immoral.” During Gates’ 2002 MenAfriVac campaign in Sub-Saharan Africa, Gates’ operatives forcibly vaccinated thousands of African children against meningitis. Approximately 50 of the 500 children vaccinated developed paralysis.Robert F Kennedy Jr. Exposes Bill Gates’ Vaccine Agenda In Scathing Report\n",

      "Today we are going to fact check the fact checkers regarding many online reports that Bill Gates wants to implant microchips in people using vaccines to fight the coronavirus.In this report we are going to focus on two articles that were published which claim to be the arbiters of truth, in these confusing times.So, is the claim that Bill Gates wants to inject you with a vaccine that contains a microchip to track who has and has not been vaccinated true? Watch the report below and decide for yourself! The vaccine \"microchip\" theory is what I would call a \"red herring\" or engineered strawman.  Whenever a REAL conspiracy is at play, it never fails that someone somewhere injects a counter-theory that goes beyond anything supported by evidence.  Much like the \"hologram planes\" on 9/11 theory, or the \"virus hoax\" theory which claims that all deaths are actually staged with \"crisis actors\".   I believe these theories are floated into the alternative media by design, and that they are meant to make the movement look ridiculous and irrational while distracting from the very legitimate and provable elitist agenda, such as the push to institute 24/7 tracking of every citizen through biometrics and so-called \"immunity passports\".  This threat is openly admitted, easily evidenced and very real, but instead we end up debating ludicrous notions that the entire pandemic is a stage play.  Or, we are presented with mindless minutia focusing on the semantics of Bill Gates tracking us with a microchip instead of Bill Gates tracking us with our own biometric attributes as he has consistently said he wants to do.  The goal here is to muddy the waters and divert people away from the core debate - Is it acceptable for the government or the elitist establishment to build a surveillance state and medical tryanny around us in the name of \"flattening the curve\"?  And the answer is no, it is not, and it should not be tolerated.\n",

      "Fear is being spread around us by the establishment through the mass media (MSM). Common sense is gone and mass hysteria is the new normal. A virus, COVID-19, is used to control the lives of people, and it's also a tool of suppression against the population.I am not going to claim whether there is a virus or not, whether it’s as dangerous as they say, or where it originated, be it in a laboratory or bio-weapon or a real virus. I only see that it has brought fear and, already in some EU countries, terror among the population.Easter 2020; where EU governments forbid us to see our beloved ones, where EU governments forbid us to travel, where most of us lose their income because they forbid us to work and take our bread without compensation. Where they tell us to wait until there is a vaccination from Bill Gates and his sponsors, the criminal gang of the Rockefellers (sponsors of the John Hopkins University). They are controlling our lives, our children's lives. If there is a virus, we can protect the elderly and sick but not destroy whole nations and people. I laughed about conspiracy thinkers in the past, but a lot of it is now reality and “new normal” as they call it. It’s 1984, and we didn’t do a thing to stop it, maybe it was too overwhelming.EU Statement.The EU is mistreating, according to the law, the elderly and sick. You can't forbid people from seeing their old mothers and fathers, or even holding a funeral for them, that is really criminal. Ursula Von der Leyen, head of the EU, also expects that: \"elderly people in care homes cannot be visited as long as there is no vaccine. I know that's difficult, but it's about human lives”, she said. “We have to be disciplined and be very patient\". \"We will have to live with the virus for months, probably until next year.\" So many elderly and sick will die without saying goodbye to their beloved ones for almost a year? How cruel. Also, she dictates that we are not allowed to book a trip or holiday, meaning we have to wait for vaccinations and forcibly be vaccinated, also a violation of human rights and freedom. This is especially so when scientists say that younger people are not dying, and weren’t we told ten or twenty years ago that the best way to catch a cold so that we get a better immune system? All of that is thrown out, and according to the EU (German- and French-dominated), our lives will never be the same after COVID-19, how frightening! China is partly back to normal, so why drive people to suicide or hunt them like criminals? Because it’s not about the virus anymore, but about power.\n",
      "The New Normal.Ready for the one and a half meter society? \"We will have to look for the new normal in the one and a half meter society,\" Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the Netherlands, the head of the EU, and Bundespresident Steinmeier of Germany declared, independent from each other, but on the same time on their national TV stations. “We are still in the middle of the corona crisis, although the number of new deaths and registered infections is leveling off”. “We can get a normal summer out of our minds, because measures will remain in force even after April 28\", they declared as well, meaning lockdown until at least September, or if and when there is a vaccination. Is this democracy? These are the signs of a totalitarian EU body which wants to control the lives of people from birth to death, where they control even our deaths, without proper funerals and loved ones. These are statements not to be made by so-called “democratic” countries, their rhetoric is an Orwellian message to us, the “free” citizens of Europe.Eurobonds.A solidarity fund to ensure that the poorest countries in the EU, like Italy, Spain and Greece -- the countries who, by the way, have been hit the hardest by the COVID-19 crisis and have their countries full of migrants and migrant workers toiling for the rich German supermarkets --pay low interest on their bonds has been taken off the table. Ironically, the richest countries, the Netherlands and Germany, voted against it, while France is silent on this matter. How dare they speak about solidarity, it’s people who are dying, not the Italian government, the people in the streets of Naples, Sicily, and small towns in southern Italy are not dying from COVID-19 but from hunger and suicide. They ask us, the citizens of the EU, to show solidarity, but we can’t because the EU is not for us since it only show ssolidarity with money for themselves and not for us. We are heading towards the suppression and loss of our freedom, a virus was needed and we gave up all our human rights, but this whole process started already in 2015 during the illegal wars in the Middle East.COVID-19 Is Used As A Tool Of Fear And Terror By The EU\n",

      "The controversial Ethiopian politician and Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, claimed in a press conference in early March that the fatality rate for the coronavirus was many multiples that of the fatality rate of the common flu.This egregiously false premise has led to the greatest panic in world history.The Director General of the WHO spoke on March 3, 2020 and shared this related to the coronavirus:While many people globally have built up immunity to seasonal flu strains, COVID-19 is a new virus to which no one has immunity. That means more people are susceptible to infection, and some will suffer severe disease.Globally, about 3.4% of reported COVID-19 cases have died. By comparison, seasonal flu generally kills far fewer than 1% of those infected.This statement led to the greatest panic in world history as the media all over the world shared and repeated that the coronavirus was many, many times more deadly than the common flu.The problem is his statement is false.  It was not accurate! The Gateway Pundit reported yesterday, that the coronavirus fatality rate reported by the media was completely inaccurate and the actual rate is less than the current seasonal flu – the media was lying again. The false reporting of the coronavirus fatality rate of 3.4% in the media started with the statements made by the WHO in early March.Here’s a summary of the analysis from yesterday proving the Director General’s statement was very misleading and materially false: The fatality rate of the coronavirus was based on current data available of known positive cases and known deaths.Oftentimes estimates have to be made because data is just not yet available. The Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, used the fatality rate of coronavirus with known numbers and used this as his prediction of eventual mortality rate.  This was a faulty assumption.  Estimates usually involve obtaining information that is available and making estimates on what is not. We cannot tell the future but we can make educated guesses based on information available. This is what has been done with the coronavirus because this type of virus has apparently never been seen before.Sometimes estimates are reasonable and sometimes they are wrong, and even way off.The point is that whenever estimates are made of large unknown values they are always wrong because no one can tell the future. Sometimes estimates end up close and sometimes they are not and sometimes they are way off.The current “estimate” for the coronavirus fatality rate according to the WHO is about 3.4%.\n",
      "The estimate used most often is from the WHO based on the Director General’s comments.  The WHO estimates the mortality rate of the coronavirus to be around 3.4%:The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated the mortality rate from Covid-19 is about 3.4%. That is higher than seasonal flu and is cause for concern – but even if it is correct, more than 96% of people who become infected with the coronavirus will recover.The same rate for this year’s seasonal flu is 10% if you use known cases and known deaths (but the media tells you it’s .1%).As The Gateway Pundit reported earlier, according to CDC numbers, in the US in the 2019-2020 flu season, there were 222552 confirmed cases of the flu from testing and an estimated 36 million flu cases in the United States. There were 22000 estimated deaths from the flu (via the CDC).Note that the number of deaths and confirmed cases (through testing) of the flu in the US are based on actual data. The number of individuals who contracted the flu is an estimate. There is no way to know who had the flu in the US because many cases are not severe and people do not have a test done to confirm they had the flu. They believe their symptoms are minor and go on with their normal lives thinking they had a cold or something similar. Because of this, the CDC estimates and they estimated 36 million people had the flu in this past flu season.The rate of the number of individuals who died from the flu to the number of individuals who were estimated to have had the flu is .1% (22552 / 36 million). This is an estimate and the amount used above by the Director General of the WHO.However, the rate of individuals who died from the flu to the number of individuals who were confirmed to have had the flu is around 10% (22000/ 222552). This is based on actual data similar to the rate for the coronavirus above.Actual results for the coronavirus are lower than the flu.Based on the above numbers, the actual fatality rate for those who were confirmed to have had the coronavirus is 3.4%.The actual mortality rates for those who were confirmed to have had the flu are around 10%.The actual data shows that the mortality rate for those who had the flu (10%) is almost twice as high than for those with the coronavirus (3.8%).Current estimates between the flu and the coronavirus are not comparing ‘apples to apples’.The fatality rate that is commonly referred to in the media for the coronavirus is 3.4% from the WHO. This number is based on confirmed cases of people with the coronavirus.The flu fatality rate provided by the CDC of .1% includes an estimate of individuals who had the flu (36000000).  This rate includes an estimate of all people with the flu, most who were not tested for the flu.The fatality rate for the coronavirus does not include those who had the coronavirus but were not confirmed. This is why the flu fatality rate is .1% and the coronavirus fatality rate is 3.4%!The two rates are like comparing apples to oranges. By doing so the coronavirus fatality rate is way overstated when compared to the flu and the WHO and the media has created a worldwide crisis and panic by reporting these rates simultaneously!The coronavirus is not more fatal than the flu based on current data available. It is much less fatal than the flu based on current data.Those most at risk from the coronavirus are the elderly and sick (similar to the flu).\n",
      "Similar to the flu, those most at risk of dying from the coronavirus are the elderly and the sick. The average age for those who died from the coronavirus in Italy is 81 years old. This is consistent around the world. There have been no known fatalities for any children 10 and under.The sick are also at a higher risk similar to the flu. Current data shows that if you have no pre-existing conditions, your fatality rate if you contract the coronavirus is .9% (and what proportion of these cases are the elderly).In summary, President Trump was right when he said the WHO’s coronavirus fatality rate was much too high.Evidence proves the coronavirus is not as deadly as what was reported by the WHO and is continually repeated in the media.In fact, current data shows it is not as deadly as the flu. The elderly and the sick should be concerned and  protected. Everyone else has little to worry about.\n",

      "China was the perfect playground for a lab-created virus to break containment. Sequencing of the virus shows that it was a manipulated strain, pieced together with virulent properties from SARS, MERS, and HIV. It doesn’t matter what the authorities say about its origin, whether it came from bats or the illegal animal markets in China; all the confusion and pandemonium began in China and has set the stage for authoritarians and sociopaths to deceive and take advantage of people throughout the world. China has at least a hundred million people in some form of lock down and Chinese citizens and healthcare workers are being censored or persecuted for speaking out about what’s happening.The virus has become a tool, an opportunity for authoritarians to seek control\n",
      "Before Chinese authorities declared an outbreak, the country was experiencing widespread upheaval, with revolutionaries challenging the communist authorities in the city streets. The Chinese government needed a reason to clear the streets, to take complete control over the people with fear and force. China was fertile ground for an outbreak, for an oppressive government to take over, to round people up, but we’re all told to blame the virus.Heavily-polluted Chinese cities provide the perfect cover for the coronavirus narrative. Physicists from the University of California, Berkeley, calculated that 1.6 million people in China die each year from heart, lung and stroke problems caused by China’s heavily polluted air. This level of pollution has set the stage for wide scale weakness of heart, lung, and immune system health. China is fertile ground for an outbreak, as viruses can readily take advantage of immune-compromised populations. But we’re told to just blame the viru.Wuhan, the city where the outbreak was first declared, had previously unleashed 5G wireless technology one month before people began falling sick with “flu-like” illnesses. Wuhan, on its way to becoming a “smart city,” was one of the first cities to test out its new grid of millimeter wave microwave radiation. 5G has been banned in some cities because it can cause “flu-like” illnesses and has been documented as a source of chromosomal breaks in DNA, oxidative damage to cells, and much more. Wuhan was fertile ground for respiratory viruses to take advantage of the population, because many unknowing people were having their innate immune cells oxidized by an influx of wireless radiation. But we’re told to just blame the virus.\n",
      "How long will the pandemonium of this virus continue and will the panic equally apply to other viruses in the future?How long will the pandemonium continue? Does anyone care that diagnostic tests are worthless for accurately defining coronavirus cases? Does anyone realize how easily case numbers can be inflated, driving hysteria through the news and into a community? Does anyone care that milder cases can be left out of the data, raising the death rate?How many people die annually from complications with the flu, pneumonia and sepsis? How many people around the world are suffering from vaccine-derived polio? What about typhus and hepatitis spreading in California? Why do children suffer from acute flaccid myelitis and RSV? In the future, will every fever and respiratory virus be treated with such authoritarian force and hysteria? Why are we supposed to fear this virus, more than all the others? It’s all about control.\n",
      "The World Health Organization, praising China for its pandemic response, has inadvertently pressured governments around the world to take advantage of the pandemonium, to exert force and control. In America, the news media has broadcast nonstop fear, coaxing the federal government to respond in “heroic” fashion.\n",
      "Trying to keep the markets from plummeting, the Trump administration has enacted the strictest quarantine measures in American history; it’s all a charade of protection because the immune-compromised American population are sitting ducks anyway. The Trump Administration is falling in line and giving the CDC over $8 billion to come up with a vaccine and to pump out new antiviral drugs that will inevitably resemble dangerous and ineffective Tamiflu. By the time the vaccine comes around, the number of coronavirus cases will inevitably have trickled down, like all historical incidences of infectious disease, but the vaccine will be heralded for saving humanity (like polio vaccines were).As the media tells us all to be afraid of a virus, governments and pharmaceutical companies are taking this as a great opportunity, an opportunity to control people, mentally and physically, and to exploit our faith, as everyone looks to them for the answers. The world need not fear a new novel coronavirus. The world should be wary of the loss of liberty and mobility that may result from this pandemonium: mandatory vaccine laws enacted by a fully-funded WHO and a paramilitary CDC. We should fear the invention of National IDs, driver’s licenses and/or passports that require everyone to submit to vaccines. We should be repulsed by the potential for roadside checkpoints and airports that could require vaccine administration and further testing of people’s body fluids. We should be wary that authoritarians will put cities and public events on lock down or how the military could be used to round people up or quarantine individuals over a fever. Because of the hysteria and pandemonium, we are slowly losing the freedom to congregate and the ability to travel abroad.These extreme measures will further convince people that the virus is dangerous, that we all need to secure order, but this authoritarian approach and its effects do not confirm that the virus is the problem or that those in charge are of goodwill.

These are indicative of biological weapons, chemical weapons and electromagnetic weapons, all formed and deployed against humanity in order to achieve the global depopulation that people like Bill Gates so desperately seek to achieve.Here’s an overview of the sections of my talk:The beliefs of the globalists: What they are trying to achieve through depopulation. (Hint: Planet Earth is being prepared for a post-human era.).How we are already in a biological war launched by globalists to destroy human freedom and exterminate most of the human population. The coronavirus attack wave is just the first of many to come.The three weapons of extermination: Bioweapons, vaccines and 5G – How they synergistically function to both enslave and exterminate the human race through electromagnetic weapons, chemical weapons and biological weapons, all without resorting to nuclear weapons that would pollute the planet for all life forms.The three layers of collapse: Debt (finance), Health and Cognition – how the collapse is being engineered at these three levels to attack the body, the mind and the spirit.How the information war against humanity is being waged with censorship of natural cures, independent journalism and pro-human information, where online information gatekeepers are actively pursuing an anti-human, anti-life agenda that ends with the mass extermination of most humans living today.Also in the presentation:How to survive the culling of the human race:Nutritional strategies to protect yourself from 5G exposure (and save your brain).Strategic relocation to evade the high population density targets such as US cities. How to make yourself resilient against the planned, engineered food supply collapse.How to preserve your wealth and assets to survive a global debt reset.

Event 201 is a high-level pandemic exercise hosted by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in partnership with the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. This is extremely fascinating because this pandemic simulation exercise of coronavirus took place about 6 weeks before the first illness from the coronavirus was actually reported in Wuhan, China. That is one hell of a coincidence if you believe in that sort of thing. Another fascinating connection is the fact that not only did the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation participate in and help set up the pandemic simulation of a coronavirus outbreak, but they just so happen to fund the group who owns the patent to the deadly coronavirus and are already working on a vaccine to solve the current crisis.

      "This April 16th, Dr. Luc Montagnier became a household name around the world. This occurred as the controversial virologist decided to publicly state his support for the theory that Covid-19 is indeed a laboratory-generated creation and not a naturally occurring effect of viral evolution.Referring to a study published at the Kusama School of Biology in New Dehli on January 31st, Montagnier (the 2008 Nobel Prize winner for his 1983 discovery of the HIV virus) made the point that the specific occurrence of HIV RNA viral segments spliced surgically within the COVID-19 genome could not have originated naturally and he described it in the following words:“We have carefully analyzed the description of the genome of this RNA virus. We weren’t the first, a group of Indian researchers tried to publish a study showing that the complete genome of this virus that has within the sequences of another virus: that of HIV.”While the Indian team was induced to retract their publication under immense pressure from the mainstream medical establishment (which never bothered to seriously refute the content of the study’s research but rather used the “random-mutation-makes-anything-possible” argument), Montagnier stated “scientific truth always emerges”.Not China: Montagnier Misdiagnoses the Culprit.Montagnier’s political ignorance became all too clear when he was asked who the culprit could possibly be.By asserting his belief that China’s BSL4 lab in Wuhan was the source, Montagnier has fallen into a trap set by Anglo-American Intelligence circles which have been promoting a military confrontation between the USA and China for a very long time.Now even though Montagnier denies that China released this virus with malicious intent (unlike many fanatical droves of neoconservatives currently itching for war), the “Wuhan Lab origin” hypothesis completely ignores the reality of the Pentagon’s globally extended 25 bioweapons laboratories which have openly created novel coronaviruses including varieties that arose in bats as journalist Whitney Webb’s remarkable February 2020 paper demonstrated.\n",
      "Even though a 2014-2017 temporary ban on “dual-use” funding was imposed onto America’s bioweapons research, nothing prevented this work from occurring internationally or even covertly within the 11 military labs on American soil itself and tied to the same Fort Detrick that was shut down in July 2019 under suspicious circumstances. As I pointed out in my previous paper The Project for a New American Century, 9/11 and Bioweapons, over $50 billion has been spent on bioweapons research since 2001 which the Project for a New American Century manifesto claimed would play a major role in the arsenal of 21st century warfare stating: “advanced forms of biological warfare that can “target” specific genotypes may transform biological warfare from the realm of terror to a politically useful tool”.Luc Montagnier’s Wave Therapy: Quackery or Brilliance?The most powerful aspect of Montagnier’s April 16th intervention into world politics in my view is not really found in his support for the laboratory-origins theory, but rather in the scientist’s often overlooked proposition for an international crash program in something called electromagnetic wave therapy. Rather than investing in vaccines, Montagnier has explained that it were much wiser for nations of the world to launch a crash project into a very different approach to viral treatments than is currently common in polite society saying:“I think we can make interference waves which are behind the RNA sequences that can eliminate those sequences with waves and consequently stop the pandemic”.Before brushing this off as “quackery” as so many are wont to do, one should keep in mind that President Trump himself has indicated his interest in Montagnier’s approach in his April 23rd briefing telling reporters:“Supposing we hit the body with a tremendous … whether it’s ultraviolet or just very powerful light. And I think you said that hasn’t been checked, but you are going to test it… And then I said supposing you brought the light inside the body, which you can do either through the skin or in some other way. And I think you said you are going to test it.”While Trump has been vilely attacked as “unscientific” for these utterances, it is only due to the vast ignorance of Montagnier’s incredible discoveries into the electromagnetic properties of life that such mockery can go unchallenged. Montagnier’s innovations into “bleaching therapy” which Trump referenced in the same speech are also much more complex than mainstream detractors assume and has nothing to do with simply “injecting”disinfectants into the blood stream. These therapies are highly interconnected with the electromagnetic waves emitted by certain types of bacteria which Montagnier has discovered to be the most likely driving mechanism to many of the diseases both chronic and acute plaguing humanity. More will be said on that below.What is Optical Biophysics and What did Montagnier Discover?Optical biophysics is the study of the electromagnetic properties of the physics of life. This means paying attention to the light emissions and absorption frequencies from cells, DNA, and molecules of organic matter, how these interface with water (making up over 75% of a human body) and moderated by the nested array of magnetic fields located on the quantum level and stretching up to the galactic level.Not to discount the bio-chemical nature of life which is hegemonic in the health science realm, the optical biophysician asks: which of these is PRIMARY in growth, replication, and division of labor of individual cells or entire species of organisms? Is it the chemical attributes of living matter or the electromagnetic properties?\n",
      "Let me explain the paradox a bit more.There are approximately 40 trillion highly differentiated cells in the average human body, each performing very specific functions and requiring an immense field of coherence and intercommunication. Every second approximately 10 million of those cells die, to be replaced by 10 million new cells being born. Many of those cells are made up of bacteria, and much of the DNA and RNA within those cells is made up of viruses (mostly dormant), but which can be activated/deactivated by a variety of methods both chemical and electromagnetic.Here’s the big question:HOW might this complex system be maintained by chemical processes alone- either over the course of a day, month or an entire lifetime?The simple physics of motion of enzymes which carry information in the body from one location to another simply doesn’t come close to accounting for the information coordination required among all parts. This is where Montagnier’s research comes in.After winning the 2008 Nobel Prize, Dr. Montagnier published a revolutionary yet heretical 2010 paper called “DNA Waves and Water” which took the medical community by storm. In this paper, Montagnier demonstrated how low frequency electromagnetic radiation within the radio wave part of the spectrum was emitted from bacterial and viral DNA and how said light was able to both organize water and transmit information! The results of his experiments were showcased wonderfully in this 8 min  video:Using a photo-amplifying device invented by Dr. Jacques Benveniste in the 1980s to capture the ultra low light emissions from cells, Montagnier filtered out all particles of bacterial DNA from a tube of water and discovered that the post-filtered solutions containing no material particles continued to emit ultra low frequency waves! This became more fascinating when Montagnier showed that under specific conditions of a 7 Hz background field (the same as the Schumann resonance which naturally occurs between the earth’s surface and the ionosphere), the non-emitting tube of water that had never received organic material could be induced to emit frequencies when placed in close proximity with the emitting tube! Even more interesting is that when base proteins, nucleotides and polymers (building blocks of DNA) were put into the pure water, near perfect clones of the original DNA were formed!Dr. Montagnier and his team hypothesized that the only way for this to happen was if the DNA’s blueprint was somehow imprinted into the very structure of water itself resulting in a form of “water memory” that had earlier been pioneered by Jacques Benveniste, the results of which are showcased in this incredible 2014 documentary “Water Memory”.Just as Benveniste suffered one of the most ugly witch hunts in modern times (led in large measure by Nature Magazine in 1988), Montagnier’s Nobel prize did not protect him from a similar fate as an international slander campaign has followed him over the past 10 years of his life. Nearly 40 Nobel prize winners have signed a petition denouncing Montagnier for his heresy and the great scientist was forced to even flee Europe to escape what he described as a culture of “intellectual terror”. In response to this slander, Montagnier stated to LaCroix magazine:  “I’m used to attacks from these academics who are just retired bureaucrats, closed off from all innovation. I have the scientific proofs of what I say”.Describing the greatest challenges to advancing this research, Montagnier stated:“We have chosen to work with the private sector because no funds could come from public institutions. The Benveniste case has made it so that anyone who takes an interest in the memory of water is considered… I mean it smells of sulphur. It’s Hell.”Casting Montagnier’s Research in a New Light.In a 2011 interview, Dr. Montagnier recapitulated the consequences of his discoveries:“The existence of a harmonic signal emanating from DNA can help to resolve long-standing questions about cell development, for example how the embryo is able to make its manifold transformations, as if guided by an external field. If DNA can communicate its essential information to water by radio frequency, then non-material structures will exist within the watery environment of the living organism, some of them hiding disease signals and others involved in the healthy development of the organism.”With these insights in mind, Montagnier has discovered that many of the frequencies of EM emissions from a wide variety of microbial DNA is also found in the blood plasmas of patients suffering from influenza A, Hepatitis C, and even many neurological diseases not commonly thought of as bacteria-influenced such as Parkinsons, Multiple Sclerosis, Rheumathoid Arthritis and Alzheimers. In recent years, Montagnier’s teams even found certain signals in the blood plasmas of people with autism and several varieties of cancers!Over a dozen French doctors have taken Montagnier’s ideas seriously enough to prescribe antibiotics to treat autism over the course of six years and in opposition to conventional theories, have found that amidst 240 patients treated, 4 out of 5 saw their symptoms either dramatically regress or disappear completely!\n",
      "These results imply again that certain hard-to-detect species of light emitting microbes are closer to the cause of these ills than the modern pharmaceutical industry would like to admit.A New Domain of Thinking: Why Big Pharma Should Be Afraid.As the filmed 2014 experiment demonstrated, Montagnier went even further to demonstrate that the frequencies of wave emissions within a filtrate located in a French laboratory can be recorded and emailed to another laboratory in Italy where that same harmonic recording was infused into tubes of non-emitting water causing the Italian tubes to slowly begin emitting signals! These DNA frequencies were then able to structure the Italian water tubes from the parent source a thousand miles away resulting in a 98% exact DNA replica!Standing as we are, on the cusp of so many exciting breakthroughs in medical science, we should ask: what could these results mean for the multi-billion dollar pharmaceutical industrial complex which relies on keeping the world locked into a practice of chemical drugs and vaccines?Speaking to this point, Montagnier stated:“The day that we admit that signals can have tangible effects, we will use them. From that moment on we will be able to treat patients with waves. Therefore it’s a new domain of medicine that people fear of course. Especially the pharmaceutical industry… one day we will be able to treat cancers using frequency waves.”\n",
      "Montagnier’s friend and collaborator Marc Henry a professor of Chemistry and Quantum Mechanics at the University of Strasbourg stated:“If we treat with frequencies and not with medicines it becomes extremely cost effective regarding the amount of money spent. We spend a lot of money to find the frequencies, but once they have been found, it costs nothing to treat.”Whether produced in a lab as Montagnier asserts or having appeared naturally as Nature Magazine asserts, the fact remains that the current coronavirus pandemic has accelerated a collapse of the world financial system and forced the leaders of the world to discuss the reality of a needed new paradigm and new world economic order. Whether that new system will be driven by Pharmaceutical cartels, and sociopathic bankers running global health policy for a technocratic elite of social engineers or whether it will be driven by nation states shaping the terms of that new system around human needs, remains to be seen.\n",
      "If nation states manage to stay in the driver’s seat of this new system, then it will have to be driven by certain fundamental principles of healthcare for all, science practice reform and broader political/economic reform whereby the sacredness of human life is placed above all considerations of monetary profit. In this light, such crash programs into long term projects in space science, asteroid defense, and Lunar/Mars development will be as necessary in the astrophysical domain as crash programs in fusion energy will be in the atomic domain. Uniting both worlds, is the domain of life sciences that intersects the electromagnetic properties of atoms, cells and DNA with the large scale electromagnetic properties of the Earth, Sun and galaxy as a whole.Big Pharma Beware: Dr. Montagnier Shines New Light on COVID-19 and The Future of Medicine\n",

      "The virus is the “softening up” attack, and it will be followed by even more aggressive attacks that attempt to destroy America. Those attacks may include financial assaults, military invasions, nuclear weapons and a second wave of more aggressive biological weapons.JR Nyquist is a remarkable historian and expert in geopolitics and the history of communism. He understands how China and Russia are both seeking to exterminate the United States of America so they can expand their own world domination plans to include North America.The coronavirus release was no accident, and it wasn’t some wild virus from bats. It’s an engineered weapon that was designed and deployed to attack America, destroy Trump, crash the US economy, eviscerate the population and pave the way for a full-strength assault on America.If your psyche can handle it, listen to this interview. It gets even more powerful in the last 15 minutes.

      "“There are times in history when sudden events—natural disasters, economic collapses, pandemics, wars, famines—change everything. They change politics, they change economics and they change public opinion in drastic ways. Many social movement analysts call these “trigger events.” During a trigger event, things that were previously unimaginable quickly become reality, as the social and political map is remade. Coronavirus is a historic trigger event—and it needs a Movement to Respond.” Paul Engler,The frightening COVID-19 pandemic, slowly but surely infecting millions, fueling an economic and political meltdown and metastasizing in the midst of a global Climate Emergency, has pushed a critical mass of us all to the brink.Words can barely convey our waking nightmare, or fully expose the cabal of monsters and the degenerate “business-as-usual” practices that have brought on this disaster. Like a horror movie rerun, every night I wake up.How did we ever let this happen? What can we do to protect ourselves and others? Can we rise to the occasion and organize a massive Grassroots Rising, head off disaster, and take advantage of this tragic “trigger moment”?Can we deal with the degenerative practices that have unleashed this mega-crisis and bring to heel the perpetrators, the greedy elite who created and/or abetted this catastrophe?As an international chorus of climate, environmental and political leaders warned this week, it’s now or never “to harness our fears, build hope and drive action to respond to the human health, economic, climate and biodiversity crisis with solutions that build resilient societies on the longer term.”Protect yourself and others. Take control of your health. Force governments to provide necessary resources.We must protect ourselves and others, especially the most vulnerable. Solidarity and common sense dictate that we change what up until now has been considered “normal” behavior.In North America, and all over the world, we need to maintain and step up the social hygiene, distancing and quarantine procedures that are absolutely necessary to reduce infections, to “flatten the curve” of a disease 10 times more lethal and three times more infective than recent flu epidemics.But to flatten the curve we need to demand that our governments put money in the hands of workers and their families (and small businesses) so that they can afford to stay home for months, or for as long as it takes.We must provide emergency funds and resources to hospitals, healthcare workers, and clinics so they can test, separate, isolate and treat those infected and exposed to the Coronavirus. Constant hand-washing and spatial distancing are absolutely necessary, even if we’re healthy, with strict spatial isolation if we’ve been exposed to those carrying the virus. Stay away from elderly people and those with fragile health.My extended family and our activist staff and networks have suspended face-to-face contact and are using email, text messages, shared photos and Zoom calls to stay in touch.Beyond spatial distancing we all need to strengthen our immune systems and preserve our physical and mental health for the challenges that lie ahead. Even though we’ve all heard it before, now is the time for action. Now is the time, as natural health leader Dr. Joseph Mercola tells us, to “Take control of your health.”\n",
      "Here’s some of what we all need to do, today and every day.Cook at home. Learn new recipes. Stop going out to restaurants until the pandemic is over. Buy local and organic whenever possible. Eliminate factory-farmed meat and animal products, GMOs and all the other nutritionally deficient and poisonous products of industrial agriculture from your diet. Purchase, prepare, and consume as many fresh and healthy, nutritionally-dense foods as possible. This means lots of organic fruits and vegetables, including fermented foods. Cut down on sugar and sugary deserts and reduce your alcohol consumption. Start growing you own sprouts indoors and get ready to plant an organic garden this spring if you have a patio or outdoor space. Consume whole organic grains and healthy carbs, not processed food. If you eat meat and animal products, search out organic, grass-fed, and pasture-raised products. But of course not everyone has access to, or can afford to buy healthy food. Ethics and solidarity require us to help others in our community gain access to organic and healthy foods. Support mutual aid projects such as food hubs, food banks, and food delivery projects in your local community.Take this opportunity to stop smoking tobacco. Coronavirus death rates are substantially higher for smokers. If you smoke pot, stop sharing joints—or better yet switch to homemade edibles. Supplement your diet with vitamins and nutritional supplements, such as Vitamin C and D to strengthen your body’s immune system and disease-fighting capabilities.Start getting regular exercise, outdoors if at all possible, but indoors if necessary. My daily regimen includes yoga stretches, light calisthenics and an hour or more of walking outdoors. Walking and/or exercising for an hour will calm you down as well boost the microphages in your body that kill pathogens.Get seven to eight hours of sleep every night. If you wake up in the middle of the night like I do, don’t take sleeping pills, search out natural sleep supplements with no side effects. For 3 a.m. insomnia, I take a four or five spray shots in my throat of Dr. Mercola’s Melatonin and put two tiny pills (30c) under my tongue of a homeopathic remedy called Nux Vomica. You can find these over-the-counter sleep supporters in your local co-op or natural food store, or else online.Try to reduce mental stress, which increases the inflammation that weakens your body’s defense mechanisms. Think positive. Remind yourself that this disaster can change politics, economics and public opinion in drastic ways. If we can unite our networks for healthy food and natural health, and create synergy with those all over the world organizing for a just transition to a green economy, we can not only overcome this pandemic, but we can solve the even more catastrophic threat posed by our Climate Emergency.  Even in this time of social distancing, people all over the world are starting to collectively resist and get organized. Search out the positive news of rebellion and mutual aid online and you’ll see that people are slowly but surely building up a compassionate and sane response to the pandemic and mobilizing to turn back racist, xenophobic and elitist government policies such as bailing out the wealthy “one percent,” instead of the rest of us, the “99 percent.” Stop spending so much time reading or watching the commercial mass media, which is filled with corporate propaganda and doom and gloom, and tune in instead to the positive information you can find in the alternative media. Go to the websites of Organic Consumers Association or Regeneration International, news sites like Common Dreams and natural health sites like Mercola. Watch the news everyday on Democracy Now!If you want a positive roadmap showing how we can reverse global warming and mobilize a critical mass to implement an organic and regenerative Green New Deal, you can read my new book: “Grassroots Rising: A Call to Action on Climate, Farming, Food, and a Green New Deal.” (The audio version is available here).  Now is the time to strengthen friendships and build up a stronger movement for radical change. If we’re going to survive the current crisis, avoid catastrophic climate change, and build the kind of world we all want and need, we need to exponentially increase solidarity and trust among heretofore separate communities and activist networks isolated in their separate silos. Please step up communications with your friends and fellow activists over the phone and the Internet and accentuate the positive. Sign up for our newsletter and stay in touch. The upside of this terrible catastrophe is that it is creating the objective and subjective conditions for a global Grassroots Rising and Regeneration Revolution.Let’s talk about the real roots of this pandemic. Here’s what Jane Goodall recently said about the pandemic crisis:“All over the world we’ve been destroying the places where animals live in order to get materials to build our homes, our cities and to make our own lives more comfortable. And as a result, we’ve brought the climate crisis on ourselves. Many species of animals and plants have become extinct. And our too-close relationship with wild animals in the markets, or when we use them for entertainment, has unleashed the terror and misery of new viruses.”The coronavirus pandemic, like the climate crisis, is not an accident, nor an act of God. Both of these existential threats have arisen out of a U.S. and global food, farming, energy, resource extraction, economic, militaristic “national security” and trading system that is degenerative, unethical, inequitable and as we see now, self-destructive.As Vandana Shiva points out:“New diseases are being created because a globalized industrialized, inefficient food and agriculture model is invading the ecological habitat of other species and manipulating animals and plants with no respect for their integrity and their health . . . The health emergency that the coronavirus is waking us up to is connected to the emergency of extinction and disappearance of species, and it is connected to the climate emergency. All emergencies are rooted in a mechanistic, militaristic anthropocentric world view of humans as separate from, and superior to other beings whom we can own, manipulate and control. It is also rooted in an economic model based on the illusion of limitless growth and limitless greed .”Unless we can stop large corporations and desperate people from destroying the habitats of wild animals, such as bats, pangolins, and civets . . . unless we can shut down the animal factories where pigs, poultry and other hapless creatures are crammed together in filthy disease-ridden environments, stuffed with genetically engineered animal feeds and dosed with drugs guaranteed to spread antibiotic resistance and virulent pathogens . . . unless we can alleviate the poverty that forces people to cut down their forests and hunt and consume and bring to market wild creatures . . . unless we as conscious global citizens can stop buying and consuming the inhumane and dangerous factory-farmed foods and products made from forest-killing commodities such as industrial palm oil and GMO soybeans . . .  unless we can stop multinational corporations from clearcutting tropical rainforests, plowing up grasslands and savannas and destroying wetlands and marine ecosystems, and instead reforest, regenerate and restore damaged ecosystems . . . unless we can break down the walls of the factory farms and get 50 billion confined farm animals back out on the land grazing and foraging in a holistic and regenerative fashion that sequesters carbon and reduces rural poverty . . . unless we can carry out a global food, farming, land-use, energy and political regeneration, we will have more emerging viruses and diseases, an out-of-control climate emergency and the endless wars, poverty and conflict that arise out of our militarized “profit at any cost” economic system.In Sonia Shan’s recent article in The Nation magazine she quotes epidemiologist Larry Brilliant, who once said, “Outbreaks are inevitable, but pandemics are optional.”But, as Shan points out:“pandemics only remain optional if we have the will to disrupt our politics as readily as we disrupt nature and wildlife. In the end, there is no real mystery about the animal source of pandemics. It’s not some spiky scaled pangolin or furry flying bat. It’s populations of warm-blooded primates: The true animal source is us.”The myth of ‘national security’ and the global military-industrial complex: disturbing information.The whole notion of “national security” (i.e. “my army or my nuclear weapons or my biological weapons are more potent than yours”) is exposed as insanity when pandemics such as the coronavirus, or looming catastrophes such as runaway global warming (which will require global cooperation to stop greenhouse gas emissions and draw down excess greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and sequester them in our soils, plants and forests), rise up and pose existential threats to us all.It’s not clear yet whether COVID-19 was weaponized in one of the world’s numerous, and secretive, chemical and biological warfare laboratories (such as the ones in Fort Detrick, Maryland, or the one in Wuhan, China) and then was accidentally or deliberately released, or whether its toxic potency was accelerated by “normal” genetic mutations as it passed from bats and pangolins through humans.But there are disturbing facts about coronavirus, biowarfare and lax security in the world’s growing network of chemical and biological warfare labs that the commercial mass media and world governments aren’t telling us about.Francis Boyle, a legal expert on chemical and biological weapons, who authored the U.S. Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989—passed unanimously by both houses of Congress and signed into law—and which bans offensive chemical and biological weapons and research, has stated that he believes the COVID-19 virus was weaponized and then accidentally released.Boyle suspects COVID-19 is a weaponized pathogen that escaped from Wuhan City’s Biosafety Level 4 facility, which was specifically set up to research coronaviruses and SARS. According to Boyle, the COVID-19 virus is a chimera. It includes SARS, an already weaponized coronavirus, along with HIV genetic material and possibly flu virus. It also has “gain of function properties” that allow it to spread a greater distance than normal.Last year (February 27, 2019) the Washington Post published a disturbing article entitled “The U.S. is funding dangerous experiments it doesn’t want you to know about.”The newsletter WanttoKnow.info summarizes and comments upon the implications of the Washington Post article (which is now behind a paywall):“In 2014, U.S. officials imposed a moratorium on experiments to enhance some of the world’s most lethal viruses by making them transmissible by air, responding to widespread concerns that a lab accident could spark a global pandemic. Apparently, the government has decided the research should now move ahead. In the past year, the U.S. government quietly greenlighted funding for two groups of researchers . . . to conduct transmission-enhancing experiments on the bird flu virus. Neither the approval nor the deliberations or judgments that supported it were announced publicly. This lack of transparency is unacceptable. Making decisions to approve potentially dangerous research in secret betrays the government’s responsibility to inform and involve the public when approving endeavors . . . that could put health and lives at risk. Hundreds of researchers . . . publicly opposed these experiments when they were first announced. In response to these concerns, the government issued a framework in 2017  for special review of ‘enhanced’ pathogens that could become capable of causing a pandemic. The framework . . . requires that experts in public-health preparedness and response, biosafety, ethics and law, among others, evaluate the work, but it is unclear from the public record if that happened. This secrecy means we don’t know how these requirements were applied, if at all, to the experiments now funded by the government.”\n",
      "On August 5, 2019, the New York Times reported that the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) had closed down (since reopened) the most important chemical and biological warfare laboratory in the U.S. at Fort Detrick, Maryland, for biosecurity lapses, “problems with disposal of dangerous materials.” Shortly thereafter, the Guardian UK newspaper linked to a video in which the CDC Director, Robert Redfield seemed to admit at a Congressional hearing that “some cases”  i.e. deaths from the coronavirus, had been discovered in the U.S. before being identified in Wuhan—no doubt due to the previously documented inability of the U.S. to test and verify differences compared with the flu.Watch this video interview with an experienced U.S. virologist, Judy Mikovits, who previously worked at Fort Detrick on weaponizing , and you’ll see why we desperately need to stop the madness, before it’s too late.I could go on and on with other disturbing “coincidences.” Hopefully COVID-19 was not weaponized in a CBW lab such as Fort Detrick or Wuhan, or at worst it was an accidental release due to a biosecurity lapse, rather than an act of war, as the Chinese, Russians and Iranians are now claiming in response to Trumps’s belligerent characterization of COVID-19 as the “Chinese Virus.”The point is that we need to stop weaponizing viruses and other pathogens in our so-called “defensive” chemical and biological weapons laboratories across the world, as international treaties dictate. We need to drop all U.S.- imposed economic sanctions across the world immediately, including those hampering current anti- COVID-19 measures in Russia, Cuba, Iran, Venezuela, Syria, North Korea and other nations.We are all in this together. We need to stop bullying and threatening one another. We need to stop spending trillions of dollars on bombs and missiles and chemical and biological warfare programs and cooperate on waging war against the real monsters that are staring us in the face: COVID-19 and the global Climate Emergency.The year 2020 will hopefully be remembered by our children and grandchildren as the transformational time when the global grassroots finally awakened to the existential threat of a Climate Emergency and the coronavirus pandemic, and forced our governments to cooperate and take decisive action.Hopefully, 2020 will be recorded in the history books as a time when we mobilized, as never before, to overcome a national and global emergency, and launched a long-overdue political and social revolution, a U.S. and global Green New Deal.Hopefully the future generations will be inspired by the unprecedented public education, grassroots lobbying, marketplace pressure, civil protest, mutual aid and farmer, energy, community and land-use innovation that will now be unfolding, galvanizing radical political and system change on a wartime scale, with a massive transfer of public and private investment from degenerative to regenerative practices.If not, future generations will look back on 2020 as the beginning of the end.We have an opportunity. As Paul Engler points out:“Trigger events can create confusion and unease. But they also present tremendous opportunities for people who have a plan and know how to use the moment to push forward their agendas. These agendas can be reactionary, as when conservatives and fascists pass harsh austerity measures and spread xenophobia—the type of activity documented in Naomi Klein’s ‘The Shock Doctrine. Yet, this type of response need not prevail. With a counter-agenda rooted in a commitment to democracy and a deep sense of collective empathy, communities can flourish, even amid a crisis.”Planet Coronavirus: Survival, Resistance and Regeneration\n",

      "First of all, the naysayers are too late. Vitamin C is already being used to prevent and treat COVID-19 in China and in Korea. And it is working.Here is a verified official statement from China's Xi'an Jiaotong University Second Hospital:\"On the afternoon of February 20, 2020, another 4 patients with severe coronavirus pneumonia recovered from the C10 West Ward of Tongji Hospital. In the past 8 patients have been discharged from hospital. . . [H]igh-dose vitamin C achieved good results in clinical applications. We believe that for patients with severe neonatal pneumonia, and for critically ill patients, vitamin C treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after admission. Numerous studies have shown that the dose of vitamin C has a lot to do with the effect of treatment. High-dose vitamin C can not only improve antiviral levels, but more importantly, can prevent and treat acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress (ARDS).\"Here is a report from Korea:\"At my hospital in Daegu, South Korea, all inpatients and all staff members have been using vitamin C orally since last week. Some people this week had a mild fever, headaches and coughs, and those who had symptoms got 30000 mg intravenous vitamin C. Some people got better after about two days, and most had symptoms go away after one injection.\"There are at least three high-dose intravenous vitamin C studies underway in China. Literally by the truckload, tons of vitamin C has been sent into Wuhan.Here is a report from a physician in China:\"We need to broadcast a message worldwide very quickly: Vitamin C (small or large dose) does no harm to people and is the one of the few, if not the only, agent that has a chance to prevent us from getting, and can treat, COVID-19 infection. When can we, medical doctors and scientists, put patients' lives first?\" (Richard Z. Cheng, MD, PhD, International Vitamin C China Epidemic Medical Support Team Leader).News media attacks on vitamin C are centered on false allegations of dangers with megadoses. This tactic lets the media ignore the truth that even LOW doses of vitamin C reduce symptoms and death rates. Do not let the media spin this issue. Advocates of vitamin C are medical doctors, not spin doctors. They are experienced, credentialed clinicians who have read the science, a small sample of which follows.Even small supplemental amounts of vitamin C can keep severely ill patients from dying.Infants with viral pneumonia treated with vitamin C had reduced mortality.17000 mg/day vitamin C given intravenously shortened intensive care unit stay by 44%.200 mg of vitamin C reduced duration of severe pneumonia in children. Oxygen saturation was improved in less than one day.The Orthomolecular Medicine News Service, and its editorial board of nearly four dozen physicians, academics and health professionals (listed below) feel it is necessary to report on what the advertiser-supported, corporate-controlled commercial media refuses to acknowledge: even small amounts of vitamin C dramatically decrease severity of symptoms, and increase survival rates, among severely ill viral patients. Large doses work better. Intravenous large doses work better still. OMNS has been relentlessly reporting on this for weeksNews Media Attacks Vitamin C Treatment of COVID-19 Coronavirus\n",

      "Professor Luc Montagnier, independent researcher and 2008 Nobel Prize winner for medicine for his discovery of HIV, was a guest of André Bercoff on Thursday 30 April, at Sud Radio.provoked a controversy a few weeks ago by expressing his doubts about the origin of the coronavirus.Now an independent researcher, the 2008 Nobel Prize in Medicine defended his point of view that the Coronavirus is man made in an interview by André Bercoff. For him, the most likely hypothesis is that the virus accidentally escaped from a laboratory in Wuhan.The first infected weren’t in the market.Luc Montagnier, a researcher specializing in viruses for “a very long time”, was sometimes questioned, but above all he was distinguished by the fact that he was a member of the panel of experts who discovered HIV. In the midst of the pandemic, the professor inevitably became interested in Covid-19 very quickly: “It is interesting to know its origins, because we can derive new therapeutic tests from it and know what will happen to this epidemic in the future,” he explains.\n",
      "The official version of the appearance of the coronavirus says that the coronavirus started at the fish market in Wuhan, where animals carrying the virus were bought and eaten, recalls Luc Montagnier. “This is a theory that does not correspond exactly to the reality of the facts,” he questions. “The first infected people were not in the market, they were more likely to be near the nearby laboratory,” the professor emphasizes.Experiments for over ten years\n",
      "In these laboratories, Chinese scientists “have been working for more than ten years on coronaviruses transmitted by animals, especially bats,” reports Professor Montagnier, who regularly reviews published reports. The experiments, which began after the SARS epidemic in Asia in 2003, were carried out by the Chinese scientists. “Bats are considered healthy carriers and therefore carry many viruses,” he explains. According to his hypothesis, “some of these researchers have tried to identify factors that could make these bats dangerous to humans. They started with a very similar model, but it was neither contagious nor pathogenic for humans because it had no receptor,” the professor suspects.Luc Montagnier, hopes that one day “scientists will say so themselves. But at the moment “we are in such a climate; there are so many dead that nobody wants to carry this very heavy burden”, he admits. Another questionable problem is that one of these laboratories “is financed by the United States, and for quite a lot of money”. “It is also a factor that explains why nobody wants to bring the truth to light,” regrets Luc Montagnier.Montagnier also discussed the presence of those HIV segments that are present in the novel coronavirus. He admits although similar segments might be present in other viruses, what remains highly suspicious is that all of these segments are all present in a small section of the coronavirus. Additionaly as the virus is mutating it seems to be mutating in those areas where the HIV segments were added.  According to him, the altered elements of this virus are eliminated as it spreads: “Nature does not accept any molecular tinkering, it will eliminate these unnatural changes and even if nothing is done, things will get better, but unfortunately after many deaths.”Luc Montagnier Insists That the Virus Came out of a Lab in Follow-Up Interview\n",

      "Canada closed its borders to all foreign nationals, except US citizens, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau urged people to stay at home to help stem the spread of the new coronavirus.“We will be denying entry into Canada to people who are not Canadian citizens or permanent residents,” Trudeau told reporters at a news conference outside his home, where he is under self-quarantine after his wife tested positive for the virus.He said Americans were exempted from the border ban. Trudeau also said he will restrict international flights to four Canadian airports from March 18th. Domestic flights will not be affected.Russia will ban the entry of foreign nationals and stateless people from March 18th to May 1st in response to the coronavirus outbreak, the government said. The ban will not apply to diplomatic representatives, airplane crew members and some other categories of people, it said.French President Emmanuel Macron has announced strict reductions in movement starting from midday on March 17th, for at least 15 days, saying “we are at war.”In a televised address to the nation, Macron said people should stay at home and only go out for essential activities. He said that anyone flouting the restrictions would be punished.France will deploy 100000 police to enforce a lockdown, and fixed checkpoints will be set up across the country.“Stay at home,” Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said, adding that fines of up to 135 euros would be handed out to those who do not respect the new restrictions, which are centered on avoiding all but essential social contact.Entry into the European Union’s Schengen zone will also be closed from March 17th, the French president said.US President Donald Trump issued new guidelines to help fight the coronavirus, including a recommendation that people avoid social gatherings of more than 10 people, discretionary travel, and going to bars, restaurants and food courts.At a White House news briefing, Trump said the new guidelines from his coronavirus task force applied for 15 days and were meant to slow the spread of the virus.\n",
      "In an answer to a question about the US economy, the Republican president said the country “may be” heading towards recession amid the pandemic, which he called an “invisible enemy”.Ireland expects its number of coronavirus cases to increase to around 15000 by the end of the month from 169 currently, Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said, predicting it would be dealing with the pandemic for many months.“We would expect that by the end of the month there would be maybe 15000 people who would have tested positive for Covid-19, most of those will not need treatment but a proportion will need to be hospitalised and we need to make sure that it doesn’t happen at the same time,” Vardkar told a news conference.China appears to have flattened the curve, and 20 out of 21 registered cases of coronavirus were people who came from abroad. Wuhan will require all overseas returnees to undergo quarantine.Lockdowns in most of the European countries have begun, with Spain expected to have a very sharp rise in infected in the next several days.Meanwhile, in Germany, the contestants in Big Brother entered the house on February 6th and haven’t been told of the international pandemic and the lockdowns.The show’s producers, for the TV channel Sat.1, defended the decision not to update the housemates on the crisis going on in the outside world, telling the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung that the information blackout would only be lifted in certain circumstances, such as a family member’s illness. They also pointed to “special hygiene measures” taken to protect residents themselves from infection, though did not explain what those measures entailed.But after uproar on social media, Sat.1 changed its position – and announced a live special episode, due to air before the regular slot at 7pm on the evening of March 17th, in which the housemates will be told of the growing crisis. They will be given the opportunity to ask questions about the state of the nation, as well as receive video messages from their relatives.Big Brother Brazil’s cast are also completely unaware of coronavirus – since they entered the house on January 21st, producers have refused to update them on the outside world.Big Brother Canada’s contestants are in a similar situation, as they entered the house on March 4th.One clip, from Canada, shows the contestants discussing the sudden absence of a live audience for evictions from the house: when the first member left, just five days in, the crowd was audible from within the house, but by March 14th, when the second was evicted, the silence was noticeable.With every passing day, the entire coronavirus crisis is looking more and more like some freaky TV series that involves most of the countries around the world. While some political leaders call the ongoing developments a “war” against the invisible enemy, the real numbers and developments on the ground clearly demonstrate that the threat is drastically exaggerated and intentionally fueled by media and governments.There are several phenomena caused by attempts of various forces and influence groups to exploit the coronavirus narrative:Financial circles and governments are using the coronavirus crisis in order to achieve own financial and political goals, as well as to cover crissi developments in the global economy (the Saudi offensive on the oil market is another sign of the crisis);The outbreak is exploited by the Washington establishment and its allies to increase pressure on the opponents of the US-dominated global order. China became the first target of the attack. Now, similar developments could be observed in Russia. Large Russian cities and even government bodies (like the foreign ministry) are being targeted by waves of fake news and artificial hysteria. Anti-government, Western-backed forces operating inside Russia will likely work to exploit the coronavirus narrative to destabilize the situation in the country;\n",
      "The virus outbreak became a useful pretext for a further regionalization of the world that breaks into seprated economic political clusters. The myth about the ‘European unity’ as well as the ‘Euro-Atlantic’ one is destroyed. All states are fighting the crisis almost alone. Only so-called “bad guys” like China, Venezuela or Cuba are offering their help to other states;Governments are strengthening surveillance and security measures limiting freedoms of citizens;Global corporations are exploiting the crisis to shape their business processes and pushing forward the concept of distance working (from home). So, they would be able to reduce costs and say goodbye to their already limited social obligations;Experts and analysts note that the increasing economic and social tensions are increasing chances of open military conflicts. One of the possible hot points is the Middle East, where the US-Iranian conflict is on the rise.There are no doubts that the crisis will end.

      "Having been permanently banned from Twitter for sharing the publicly-available details of the man who ran the show as far a bat-soup virology in Wuhan’s super-secret bio-lab – which is now a common talking point and rapidly shifting from conspiracy theory to conspiracy fact – we thought a reminder of how we got here was in order.(Article by Tyler Durden republished from ZeroHedge.com).Scott Burke,  CEO of crypto-related firm Groundhog, unleashed what we feel may be the most complete timelines of facts to help understand the controversial links between COVID-19 and HIV, and COVID-19 and Wuhan Institute of Virology.Want to go down a (strictly fact-based) rabbit hole?Here is the full slightly-edited-for-formatting twitter thread. A disclaimer: I am not a virologist. This is me synthesizing what we have learned since the outbreak began and reviewing public scientific papers. I believe each of the following statements is a solid fact, backed up by a citation. I also want to say that I understand some people are worried about blame being cast for this outbreak. Obviously we are all in this together, and my intention here is not to cast blame. These links overwhelmingly compel further scrutiny, but are not conclusive.I do think however that information is being downplayed and suppressed by some scientists and media outlets and it’s our duty to find out the facts about this virus, do what we can to mitigate the outbreak, and prevent it from happening again.Ready.So there’s original SARS, which is a type of coronavirus. SARS infects cells through the ACE2 receptor in hosts.The S spike protein plays a key role in how the virus infects cells. Each of the little spikes that surround the coronavirus is a spike protein (or S protein). That’s what gives the coronavirus it’s name – it’s “crown” of these spikes.The S protein binds to the targeted cell through the ACE2 receptor, and boom, your cell is infected and becomes a virus replication factory.After the first SARS outbreak, there was a “land rush” to find other coronaviruses. A collection of SARS-*like* coronaviruses was isolated in several horseshoe bat species over 10 years ago, called SARS-like CoVs, or SL-CoVs. Not SARS exactly, but coronaviruses similar to SARS.In 2007, a team of researchers based in Wuhan, in conjunction with an Australian laboratory, conducted a study with SARS, a SARS-like coronavirus, and HIV-1.The researchers noted that if small changes were made to the S protein, it broke how SARS-CoV worked – it could no longer go in via ACE2. So they inferred the S protein was critical to the SARS attack vector. They also predicted based on the S-ACE2 binding structure, that SARS-like CoVs were not able to use this same attack method (ACE2 mediation).They decided to create a pseudovirus where they essentially put a SARS-like CoV in a HIV envelope. It worked.Using an HIV envelope, they replaced the RBD (receptor binding domain) of SL-CoV with that of SARS-CoV, and used it to successfully infect bats through ACE2 mediation.12 years goes by.A SARS-like CoV begins sweeping the globe that is far more infectious than previous outbreaks.Ground Zero for this outbreak (not first human patient, but first spreading event) is considered to be Wuhan Seafood Market.Wuhan Seafood Market is 20 miles from the National Biosafety Laboratory at Wuhan Institute of Virology.Amidst the outbreak, a team of Indian bioinformatics specialists at Delhi University released a paper pre-print. COVID-19 has a unique sequence about 1378 nucleotide base pairs long that is not found in related coronaviruses. They claimed to identify genetic similarities in this unique material between COVID-19 and HIV-1. Specifically, they isolated 4 short genetic sequences in key protein structures (the receptor binding domain, or RBD).Two of the sequences were perfect matches (albeit, short), and two of the sequences were matched but each with an additional string of non-matching material appearing in the middle of the sequence.The paper was criticized and numerous attempts have been made to debunk it. After the criticism, the authors voluntarily withdrew it, intending to revise it based on comments made about their technical approach and conclusions.One key debunking attempt claims this:The same sequences are found in a variant called BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013, which had been found “in the wild” in bats.This is an attempt to prove that it was not engineered, but mutated naturally in the wild.But there’s a problem.This strain was only known by and studied at the Wuhan Virology Institute, and although they claim it was discovered in 2013, it wasn’t published or shared with the scientific community until immediately after the Indian paper, on January 27, 2020.The RatG13 strain publication and the HIV research paper from 2008 share an author.I discovered this on my own by comparing the two papers and then quickly realized this scientist’s contact information was the information that ZeroHedge was suspended from Twitter for sharing.Their article identifies this author in question including some contact information from the Wuhan Virology Institute web site.You can read the public comments and discussion of the original paper here:There is a line of inquiry about how the sequences are remarkably stable in between the “bat” CoV and the nCoV, where in nature they would likely have mutated in between their shared evolution. Also a call for greater scientific evidence that the strain was collected in the wild.Here is the only point in this thread where I will offer my opinion rather than a list of facts: In light of all the previous facts, the efforts to debunk the paper are not yet convincing in my view. The RaTG13 paper makes the claim that, oh, that HIV-related material you identified that happens to protein fold to become a perfect attack vector for nCoV to attack ACE2?It’s a relative of this other secret virus which came from the wild which we forgot to tell the scientific community about until now for no reason.Here’s the secret virus – it came from bats – and here’s the new virus, see, they have the same HIV-related sequences… so… bats!Totally not secret pathogen research which escaped the lab. What are the odds that a SARS-like coronavirus with overlapping genetics from HIV mutated and crossed over into humans, next door to a laboratory which had been enhancing coronavirus with HIV for over a decade? And conversely, what are the odds it leaked out of the laboratory?Finally, there is a great thread here by Trevor Bedford (@trvrb) examining the evidence for and against, with key replies challenging the conclusions made as well.Let’s learn! What do you think? Maybe I’m wrong! Can anyone disprove any of the links in the chain above? One thing is for sure, the science behind all this is fascinating. But we need to make sure that if viruses are being secretly developed and accidentally released, that we learn about that and do our best to make sure it doesn’t happen again“What are the odds?” – A timeline of facts linking COVID-19, HIV, & Wuhan’s secret bio-lab\n",

      "Just as COVID-19 (reportedly caused by the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2) has dominated the news cycle in 2020, so, too, the focus on an eventual coronavirus vaccine has crowded out needed attention to a wider range of prevention and treatment strategies. Self-appointed pandemic guru Bill Gates—through a complex tangle of direct and indirect funding mechanisms that includes being the World Health Organization’s (WHO’s) second largest donor—is gleefully leading the contingent promoting planet-wide coronavirus vaccination, unashamedly asserting that a vaccine “is the only thing that will allow us to return to normal.” Gates has the effrontery to make such claims despite financial conflicts of interest blatant enough to be noticed even by the credulous, and a lengthy trail of vaccine-related destruction left in the wake of Gates-funded vaccine programs around the world.Globally, roughly 70 COVID-19 vaccines are in various stages of development—a veritable gold rush that will be all the more lucrative since Gates has made sure that the vaccines will be indemnified against lawsuits. Gates funding, through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), is helping to spur the accelerated development of some of the leading contenders, including two of the three experimental vaccines rushed into Phase I trials in humans without any preliminary testing in animal models. (A third experimental vaccine will soon proceed to Phase II trials in China.) The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is running the trial of one of these vaccines (mRNA-1273), co-developed under CEPI sponsorship with Cambridge-based biotech firm Moderna. Meanwhile, Pennsylvania-based Inovio Pharmaceuticals is conducting a Phase I trial of INO-4800, a vaccine being developed with massive infusions of funding from both the Gates Foundation and CEPI.Kim warned that even when vaccine makers appropriately begin the process with animal studies, “vaccine development is characterized by a high failure rate of often 93%.In early April, Dr. Jerome H. Kim (Director General of the United-Nations-affiliated International Vaccine Institute) called attention to the “unprecedented speed” with which the Phase I trials launched, stating that it will be difficult to know whether a vaccine developed in a scant four, 12 or even 18 months “is really safe” and noting that the vaccine development process ordinarily takes anywhere from five to ten years. Although striving for enthusiasm about the “remarkable” speed-up, Kim warned that even when vaccine makers appropriately begin the process with animal studies, “vaccine development is characterized by a high failure rate of ‘often 93%.’”Dr. Kim’s words of warning are far from theoretical. In the mid-to-late 2000s, scientists engaged in an ultimately futile effort to develop a vaccine to address the first SARS-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Researchers of the day developed four SARS-CoV vaccines that underwent testing in animal models and two (described in 2007 and 2008) that proceeded to Phase I trials in humans. The less-than-reassuring results of the animal studies, in particular, prompted one set of researchers to conclude that “Caution in proceeding to application of a SARS-CoV vaccine in humans is indicated” [emphasis added].\n",
      "…all of the vaccinated mice, irrespective of the type of vaccine or the presence or absence of aluminum adjuvant, displayed unique lung damage not seen in the control mice.Troubling results in animals.In 2012, Texas researchers with combined expertise in molecular virology, microbiology, immunology, biodefense and emerging diseases reported in the journal PLoS ONE on their evaluation—in mice—of four candidate vaccines designed to prevent SARS-CoV. All four vaccines had run into trouble in earlier experimental studies, which showed that the vaccines had a tendency to induce pathologic lung reactions in the unfortunate recipients—whether mice, ferrets or nonhuman primates.The Texas scientists reevaluated the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of two whole-virus vaccines prepared in Vero tissue or Vero cell cultures (from African green monkey kidney); one recombinant (genetically engineered) DNA spike protein vaccine produced in insect cells; and their own virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine containing SARS-CoV proteins as well as mouse hepatitis coronavirus. They also compared versions of the vaccines containing an aluminum adjuvant with adjuvant-free formulations. The research team injected the experimental groups of mice with vaccine on days zero and 28, exposed them to live SARS-CoV on day 56 and sacrificed them two days later (day 58) to examine the lungs for virus and histopathology, comparing the experimental mice to control groups.All four vaccines appeared to induce antibodies against SARS-CoV two days after exposure to live virus. However, the second set of results—the findings that persuaded the researchers to urge the utmost caution in proceeding to human testing—showed that all of the vaccinated mice, irrespective of the type of vaccine or the presence or absence of aluminum adjuvant, displayed unique lung damage not seen in the control mice, and the pathology occurred in the absence of any detectable SARS coronavirus in the lungs. The researchers described this “Th2-type immunopathology”—indicated in part by abnormal levels of white blood cells called eosinophils—as suggestive of vaccine-induced “hypersensitivity to SARS-CoV components.”the RSV vaccine stimulated an unbalanced immune response that potentiated disease in the vaccine recipients upon subsequent exposure to RSV, often leading to hospitalization and sometimes leading to death.Troubling results in humans.To explain their findings, the Texas researchers pointed to studies showing similar immunopathologic reactions in human infants who, in the 1960s, received vaccines for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). That body of research found that the RSV vaccine “stimulated an unbalanced immune response” that “potentiated” disease in the vaccine recipients upon subsequent exposure to RSV, often leading to hospitalization and sometimes leading to death. Given that the very basis for developing a SARS vaccine was to protect vaccine recipients from infectious SARS-CoV, the Texas researchers concluded that a vaccine that instead elicited an immunopathologic reaction (as had occurred in the 1960s with the RSV vaccine) was cause for concern.More recently, in 2016, scientists expressed similar worries when children in the Philippines developed serious complications or died after receiving a vaccine to protect against dengue disease. Far from protecting the children, the vaccine dramatically worsened risks of severe complications in children exposed to dengue after vaccination. The deaths of roughly 600 children are now under criminal investigation.Two other worries highlighted by the Texas researchers in 2012 are worth mentioning in light of today’s COVID-19 context. First, given that there are a number of human coronaviruses, the researchers suggested that their results raised important questions about the “safety of vaccinated persons exposed to other coronaviruses.” Second, they noted that although the two Phase I clinical trials of SARS-CoV vaccines in humans had reported the vaccines to “induce antibody responses and to be ‘safe,’ . . . the evidence for safety [was] for a short period of observation.” Today, knowing that even the WHO’s top experts are questioning how vaccine safety gets evaluated, one wonders how the rushed COVID-19 vaccine trials will be able to address SARS-CoV safety concerns to any meaningful degree.Gates declared himself thrilled with NIH for pushing [vaccine research] forward.Cheech and Chong…and Gates.Bill Gates and his foundation have longstanding ties with the good-cop/bad-cop duo that has been headlining the official COVID-19 narrative: Dr. Anthony Fauci, long-time NIAID director, and physician and retired Army colonel Dr. Deborah Birx, U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator and Special Representative for Global Health Diplomacy. It is noteworthy that the two government doctors are long-time allies, having cut their professional teeth working “side by side” on the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s and sharing overlapping career paths ever since. With HIV vaccine patents to both their names, neither Birx nor Fauci is a stranger to the lure and potential profits involved in vaccine development—regardless of whether the vaccine ever pans out.In the early 2000s, Birx was one of the lead investigators of an HIV vaccine clinical trial in Thailand. Although the trial’s methodology and results drew severe criticism, Birx and others—including Fauci—spun the study as a success. As her reward, Birx then spent the next ten years directing the CDC’s Division of Global HIV/AIDS. In 2016, Fauci and NIAID dished out more taxpayer money to test the same HIV vaccine all over again in South Africa, but NIAID had to call a halt to the study in February 2020, when an interim review found that the vaccine was worthless.Around the same time as the Thai vaccine trial, Fauci was active as one of the “principal architects” of the 2003 President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), a still-ongoing program that has since ballooned into over 50 countries, where it coordinates (across seven different U.S. departments and agencies) promotion of HIV drugs and other measures. Since 2014, PEPFAR has been led by none other than Birx, who has been only too happy to accept generous Gates Foundation support. The foundation is the top source of philanthropic funding for all international HIV efforts, and development of an HIV vaccine remains one of its core “areas of focus.” In the face of recent Trump administration threats to slash PEPFAR’s budget, Birx has declared her willingness to seek out “other sources of funding wherever she can find them.”The National Institutes of Health (NIH), of which NIAID is a part, have been joined at the hip with the Gates Foundation for many years, together funding 57% of “global-health research and development on diseases that disproportionately affect populations in low- and middle-income countries.” The close partnership has involved working to develop new vaccines (such as a malaria vaccine and a universal influenza vaccine) as well as mobilizing Gates funding streams to roll out NIH-developed vaccines across the developing world. In 2013, Gates declared himself “thrilled” with NIH for “pushing [vaccine research] forward” and stated, “We are just at the beginning of what we can do together.”the studies on unsafe vaccines for SARS-CoV, RSV and dengue suggest that Americans would be wise to ask the age-old question of ‘who benefits’ and push back against the billionaires and scientists looking to limit choices, control populations and make a financial killing.Singing the same discordant tune.Despite writing on March 26 in The New England Journal of Medicine that the COVID-19 case fatality rate is likely to be no worse than the rate observed for a severe seasonal flu, Dr. Fauci continues to pledge allegiance to extreme measures, parroting Mr. Gates’ statements that more prolonged lockdowns are necessary and advising Americans to become a nation of obsessive-compulsive hand-washers who never share a handshake again. On these topics , Birx has been evasive and non-committal.Recently, Dr. Zeke Emanuel—coronavirus advisor to both Joe Biden and the WHO, and one of the former ringleaders behind Obamacare—joined the fray, urging the banning of conferences, concerts, sporting events, religious services and restaurant meals for another 18 months, or “until we have a vaccine that protects everyone.” The Guardian obligingly echoed this vaccine-centric propaganda on April 8 when, reporting on a Chinese study just published in The Lancet, the British rag stated that “Lockdowns can’t end until Covid-19 vaccine found.Listening to these individuals’ carefully crafted public briefings on COVID-19 exit strategies, one could easily get the impression that a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is, indeed, the only way out. For a population amped up on hysteria and fear, it may be challenging to accept other solutions—including the historically documented benefits of natural herd immunity—but the studies on unsafe vaccines for SARS-CoV, RSV and dengue suggest that Americans would be wise to ask the age-old question of “who benefits” and push back against the billionaires and scientists looking to limit choices, control populations and make a financial killing.Gates and Company’s COVID-19 Vaccine Boosterism Ignores Significant SARS Coronavirus Vaccine Risks Known for Over a Decade\n",

      "Europ is in panic. It’s targeted not only by a new wave of illegal migrants sent by Turkey and the collapse of energy markets, but also by a coronavirus threat. Over the past days, Italy became the key center of the coronavirus outbreak sparking declarations about a total lockdown.The virus, known as Covid-19, has now infected close to 115000 people worldwide and resulted in more than 4000 deaths. The majority of these cases are in mainland China, where the outbreak first emerged. As of March 10, a total of 80761 cases and 3136 deaths were registered. However, Beijing seems to be gaing an upper hand and the rate of infection has been slowing significantly in the country, and the situation stabilizing. Over 60000 people recovered and during the past 24 hours, there were only 26 new coronavirus cases registered in mainland China. The nubmer of coronavirus cases per 1 million of population stands at approximately 56.1.South Korea, which was another epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, is also dealing with the situation successfully. The toal number of cases is 7513. The number of death is 54. During the past 24 hours there were 35 new cases registered only. The total number of cases per 1 million of people is 146.5.The situation is fully different in Europe. During the past few days only, Italy (mostly), France and Spain turned to be the center of chaos and virus hysteria. The speed and scale of the outbreak is surprising. According to live updates, there were a total of 9172 cases registered in Italy with 463 deaths already. 1797 new cases and 97 new deaths were registered on March 9 only. The number of total cases per 1 million of population is 151.7. This is higher than in China and South Korea despite the fact that the density of population in Italy is much lower.The crisis in France and Span is not so acute, but it also surprising.Europe has almost 1.5 months to prepare for the spreading coronavirus problem. However, no effective measures were apparently employed. The disregard to epidemiological norms and measures needed to combat the oubreak is among the key issues named by local sources.Until recently, all limitations and measures employed by Italian authorities were merely a formality. On March 9, the northern region of Lombardy and 14 other provinces were placed under lockdown. Additional measures included blanket travel restrictions, a ban on all public events, the closures of schools and public spaces such as movie theaters, and the suspension of religious services including funerals or weddings. However, Italy is already the center of the outbreak and all these measures appear to be at least late.For example, India, which is located relatively near such centers of the outbreak as South Korea, China and Iran, did not fall into such a crisis. The difference is in the measures employed.There is little doubt that the coronavirus threat is overestimated by mainstream media and governemnts. Covid-19 is in fact an ordinary viral disease with a slightly higher mortality from complications for people of old age or peopel with weakened immunity. Another open secret is that the current hysteria over the outbreak is being successfully used by some players to achieve their own economic and geopolitical goals. Looking at the current situation in Europe, one could suppose that some forces have seized an opportunity and are now fueling the coronavirus crisis intentionally.CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK IN EUROPE: CRIMINAL NEGLIGENCE OR PREPLANNED ACTION\n",

      "Governments love crises because when the people are fearful they are more willing to give up freedoms for promises that the government will take care of them. After 9/11, for example, Americans accepted the near-total destruction of their civil liberties in the PATRIOT Act’s hollow promises of security.It is ironic to see the same Democrats who tried to impeach President Trump last month for abuse of power demanding that the Administration grab more power and authority in the name of fighting a virus that thus far has killed less than 100 Americans.Declaring a pandemic emergency on Friday, President Trump now claims the power to quarantine individuals suspected of being infected by the virus and, as Politico writes, “stop and seize any plane, train or automobile to stymie the spread of contagious disease.” He can even call out the military to cordon off a US city or state.State and local authoritarians love panic as well. The mayor of Champaign, Illinois, signed an executive order declaring the power to ban the sale of guns and alcohol and cut off gas, water, or electricity to any citizen. The governor of Ohio just essentially closed his entire state.The chief fearmonger of the Trump Administration is without a doubt Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health. Fauci is all over the media, serving up outright falsehoods to stir up even more panic. He testified to Congress that the death rate for the coronavirus is ten times that of the seasonal flu, a claim without any scientific basis.End the Shutdown; It’s Time for Resurrection!On Face the Nation, Fauci did his best to further damage an already tanking economy by stating, “Right now, personally, myself, I wouldn’t go to a restaurant.” He has pushed for closing the entire country down for 14 days.Over what? A virus that has thus far killed just over 5000 worldwide and less than 100 in the United States? By contrast, tuberculosis, an old disease not much discussed these days, killed nearly 1.6 million people in 2017. Where’s the panic over this?If anything, what people like Fauci and the other fearmongers are demanding will likely make the disease worse. The martial law they dream about will leave people hunkered down inside their homes instead of going outdoors or to the beach where the sunshine and fresh air would help boost immunity. The panic produced by these fearmongers is likely helping spread the disease, as massive crowds rush into Walmart and Costco for that last roll of toilet paper.The madness over the coronavirus is not limited to politicians and the medical community. The head of the neoconservative Atlantic Council wrote an editorial this week urging NATO to pass an Article 5 declaration of war against the COVID-19 virus! Are they going to send in tanks and drones to wipe out these microscopic enemies?People should ask themselves whether this coronavirus “pandemic” could be a big hoax, with the actual danger of the disease massively exaggerated by those who seek to profit – financially or politically – from the ensuing panic.That is not to say the disease is harmless. Without question people will die from coronavirus. Those in vulnerable categories should take precautions to limit their risk of exposure. But we have seen this movie before. Government over-hypes a threat as an excuse to grab more of our freedoms. When the “threat” is over, however, they never give us our freedoms back.The Coronavirus Hoax. “Governments Love Crises”\n",

      "Ms. N lives in Wuhan, China. She takes special care about the well-being of her entire family including her chronically-ill mother, aged 71. Ms. N has always been interested in nutrition and she recently learned about vitamin C's antiviral effects.I am an American physician currently residing in Shanghai. I interviewed Ms. N by telephone after I received a forwarded story that she posted on Chinese social media, WeChat. I made an effort to connect with Ms. N to verify the story and below is what she told me.Ms. N lives with her child in the epicenter of COVID-19 pandemic. She is close to her parents and her brother and his wife. The six of them visit each other on a regular basis. Her mother has diabetes and heart disease with stents placed, in addition to several other chronic illnesses including reflux esophagitis.\n",
      "Right before the Chinese New Year, around January 21st, her mother developed flu-like symptoms, with a low grade fever of 38C. Based on her knowledge. Ms. N advised all members of the family to take oral vitamin C. She herself has been taking about 20000 mg daily in divided-up doses. Her mother reluctantly took a smaller dose, probably half or less of what her daughter's been taking.Her mother's condition was stable for 9-10 days. But on January 30th, without deteriorating, her mother decided to go to Wuhan Union Hospital, Tongji College of Medicine, The Science and Technology University of Central China, a hospital prominent not only in Wuhan, but in all of China. She wanted to check out if she was infected with the Wuhan pneumonia virus. She got her presumption confirmed. At the hospital, she was diagnosed of what became known now as Covid-19 pneumonia. The second day upon admission, her fever started going up, as high as 39.6C. In about 10 days on February 10th she was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit and went on the heart-lung machine as a final attempt to save her life.At this time Ms. N learned of the clinical trials with vitamin C, administered by infusion (IVC; intravenous vitamin C). Immediately she requested the person in charge on the ICU to use large dose IVC on her mother. The attending physician agreed but would go only to around 10000 mg. So it happened. After 20 days in ICU, her mother improved and was discharged to a regular ward a few days ago, continuing the IVC treatment, as insisted by Ms. N.While in hospital, Miss N, her brother and sister-in-law took turns to visit and take care of her mother. They were wearing very simple protection: gloves and masks. Also noted is that while her mother got sick at home, none of the five other family members was wearing any mask for several days. But all of them went on oral vitamin C tablets. None of them developed COVID-19 infection.So far this is the story of Ms. N. We wish her mother a full and rapid recovery.In the context of the vast amount of research, clinical studies, case reports and my own decades of experience on vitamin C's use on viral infections, I summarize the story below with a few take-home messages:Vitamin C tablets at high doses daily may be the reason why the family didn't catch the infection.Given her age, history of chronic disease, and the high mortality of COVID-19 on seniors, IVC may have played a large role in her mother's improvement.The news of official IVC clinical trials has definitely had a positive impact in this case, as the attending physician was emboldened to use IVC. A well-functioning immune system is of the utmost importance to keep away the viral infection. And, vitamin C may support the defense against the COVID-19 virus, most importantly in chronically ill patients with a weakened immune system.(Note from Andrew W. Saul, OMNS Editor-in-Chief: Dr. Richard Cheng is still in China now. He continues to work overtime with expert Chinese doctors and hospitals to facilitate providing intravenous vitamin C for the most seriously ill COVID-19 victims.

      "The blaring headline in Newsweek: DR. FAUCI BACKED CONTROVERSIAL WUHAN LAB WITH U.S. DOLLARS FOR RISKY CORONAVIRUS RESEARCH. Did Dr. Anthony Fauci fund, with American taxpayer dollars, the research that produced the coronavirus that has shut down and locked up the mightiest and most free nation in history? The answer is, “Probably yes.” Should he have known better? The answer is, “Indubitably yes.” Dr. Fauci has been virtually worshiped as an icon by the press and the public has been played by Brad Pitt on Saturday Night Live and is being considered for Sexiest Man of the Year. According to Newsweek, he is something of “an American folk hero for his calm, steady leadership” during the crisis. Just last year, Dr. Fauci, who heads up the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIH), sent the scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology a boatload of money to pursue gain-of-function research on bat viruses, research which has been going on at Wuhan for years. “Gain-of-function” refers to research that involves manipulating viruses in the lab “to explore their potential for infecting humans.” (Emphasis mine throughout.) Writes Newsweek, “Gain-of-function techniques have been used to turn viruses into human pathogens capable of causing a global pandemic.” The catastrophic risks, should one of these manipulated viruses escape containment, are obvious. The U.S. Embassy warned in January of 2018 that the Wuhan Institute had a record of shoddy practices that could lead to an accidental release. According to its cable, “[T]he new lab has a serious shortage of appropriately trained technicians and investigators needed to safely operate this high-containment laboratory.” The Obama administration was so alarmed by worries about an outbreak that they suspended support for this kind of research at Wuhan in 2014. But when Trump took office, Fauci was able to persuade him that it was safe, and the project resumed in 2017. The second tranche of multi-million dollar funding came in 2019, and this stash was particularly devoted to understanding how bat coronaviruses could mutate to attack humans. The National Institutes of Health canceled this project for a second time on April 24, just two weeks ago. Dr. Fauci has not responded to Newsweek’s request for comment. Richard Ebright, an infectious disease expert at Rutgers University, said the project description refers to experiments that are designed to enhance the ability of bat coronavirus to infect human cells through genetic engineering. The risk of causing a pandemic through an accidental release from the lab is obviously a prime concern. Our intelligence agencies now believe the pandemic outbreak may have emerged “accidentally” due to “unsafe laboratory practices” at the Wuhan lab. \n",
      "This research at WIV, research funded with our tax dollars, was dedicated to deliberately creating a version of a bat virus that could be transmitted to humans. The insane purpose here was ostensibly to develop such a virus so it could be studied and a therapeutic response developed before it caused a worldwide pandemic. This kind of research is so obviously crazy and dangerous that 200 research scientists wrote a letter pleading that such foolish and potentially lethal research be terminated. But the NIH, under the direction of Dr. Fauci, sent $3.7 million to the WIV lab in 2014, and then showered the Chinese scientists at this lab with another $3.7 million in 2019 to keep their work going, the work of developing a bat virus that could attack people. Two back-to-back 5-year projects that took $7.4 million out of taxpayer pockets and out of the United States. When the NIH ended Obama’s moratorium on this research, and the second phase of research began, NIH established a framework to determine how the research would go forward. The heart of the framework was that scientists would have to get approval from a panel of experts who would decide whether the obvious risks were justified. The kicker here is that these reviews were conducted in secret. After Science magazine discovered that NIH had approved two influenza projects using gain-of-function methods, scientists rightly opposed to this kind of research wrote a scathing editorial in the Washington Post. The authors were Tom Inglesby of Johns Hopkins and Mark Liptsitch of Harvard. “We have serious doubts about whether these experiments should be conducted at all. With deliberations kept behind closed doors, none of us will have the opportunity to understand how the government arrived at these decisions or to judge the rigor and integrity of that process.\" Dr. Fauci began working in earnest on gain-of-function research over a decade ago, in connection with bird-flu viruses. The research involved taking wild viruses and passing them through live animals until they mutated into a form that could actually pose a pandemic threat. These researchers would take a virus that was poorly transmitted among humans and turn it into one that was highly transmissible. Ferrets were the animals of choice. Ferrets were deliberately infected and researchers allowed the virus to mutate in the lab’s ferret colony. The mutations continued until the virus was able to infect a ferret that had not been deliberately infected with the disease. Researcher Ron Fouchier of Erasmus University in Holland knew he had succeeded when a virus jumped from an infected ferret to an uninfected ferret in an adjacent cage who had had no contact with the infected animal. Transmissibility had been achieved, and Fouchier had created a pandemic-causing virus in his lab. Fouchier's work, wrote Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch in the journal Nature in 2015, \"entails a unique risk that a laboratory accident could spark a pandemic, killing millions.\" A consortium of 17 scientists, the Cambridge Working Group, issued a statement of protest, that was eventually endorsed by 200 scientists (mentioned above) because well, accidents happen. Here’s how the statement read in part: “Laboratory creation of highly transmissible, novel strains of dangerous viruses...poses substantially increased risks. An accidental infection in such a setting could trigger outbreaks that would be difficult or impossible to control.” Fauci defended this kind of research in a 2011 op-ed in the Washington Post, writing that “information gained through biomedical research...provides a critical foundation...for generating countermeasures, and, ultimately protecting the public health.” Bottom line: it appears that dangerously misguided research in Wuhan, funded by U.S. taxpayer dollars under the direction of Dr. Fauci, created the virus that is now plaguing the world. The research was allowed to continue by Dr. Fauci despite warnings from 200 prominent scientists that such research was exceedingly dangerous. It may be time to ask whether Dr. Fauci is in the right place at the right time.Did Dr. Fauci Fund the Research That Led to Coronavirus Outbreak?\n",

      "By all accounts and from the very beginning it was clear that Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) was at the very most a bad cold – little more dangerous than the annual flu – but being deliberately hyped to stampede the public into a tangled web of bad policies.As early as last month cooler-headed experts warned that hyped death rates spread by politicians, the Western corporate media, other various panic-mongers, and even World Health Organization (WHO) officials would give way to much, much lower death rates as more people were tested, found to have had the virus, and showed little to no symptoms.The numbers of infections versus deaths in Iceland where testing has been the most widespread shows a death rate of about 0.5%, though only 5% of the population has been tested. 50% of those tested showed no symptoms at all meaning that many, many more Icelanders likely had the virus, overcame it with ease, and never visited a doctor or hospital to avail themselves for testing or to make into national Covid-19 statistics.Another study conducted in the United States by Stanford University found the infection rate was likely 50-85 times higher than reported – meaning the death rate was astronomically lower than reported at around 0.2% to as low as 0.12% – not the 3-4% claimed by the World Health Organization.In other words – Covid-19 is no more dangerous or deadly than the annual flu. But it has been hyped as such by Western politicians, the Western corporate media, and even international institutions like WHO – a deliberate deception accompanied by coordinated theater including government briefings with reporters comically spaced out in “fear” of contracting Covid-19.Other props used to panic the public into imprisoning themselves at home and accepting the immense socioeconomic damage “lockdowns” are causing included showing the expotential graphs of infections seemingly rising straight up with no end in sight.If responsible journalists put these graphs in context – say, perhaps next to annual flu infection curves – the public would notice they are identical and simply represent the way the flu, colds, and Covid-19 which is related to both – work their way through populations.The same goes for total deaths. Should the media present Covid-19 deaths in the context of and in comparison to annual deaths from the flu, Americans – for example – would see that versus the 2019 flu season, Covid-19 is actually 30000-40000 deaths short of just matching the common flu – saying nothing of living up to the hype and hysteria the government and media have deliberately created around Covid-19 to justify lockdowns.So why have governments around the globe crippled their economies, put millions out of work, and placed draconian measures in place to, in essence, imprison their populations at home?Those with power and money seek to keep what they have and to take what little is left in the hands of others. During the manufactured “War on Terror,” similar hysteria was deliberately spread across society to justify draconian police powers at home and endless wars abroad – pouring ultimately trillions into the accounts of defense contractors and the financial institutions invested in them.During a manufactured health crisis like the 2009 H1N1 “Swine Flu” outbreak, the unfounded fear of an uncontrollable pathogen ravaging the population helped justify the centralizing of control over people’s health and lifestyle while pumping billions in pubic funding into the coffers of big-pharma.And here we are again with the very same interests who lied to us about all of the above, doing it again and on a much larger and more destructive scale – creating socioeconomic havoc virtually no one will escape completely.If the Covid-19 hoax doesn’t convince you to divest from the politicians and the corporations they serve – including divesting from big-business’ goods and services – nothing will.

      "Fear is one of the most powerful tools the elites have at their disposal. Using the mainstream media, politicians and others who want world domination can inject fear into the public at the drop of a hat, making them easy to manipulate and control.Aristotle once said: “He who has overcome his fears will truly be free.” Fear is a powerful weapon, and it’s been used globally for the past few months.  People have shown that the instant the media tells them to live a life scared in their homes, they will comply in order to “stay safe.” Whether the virus is real or not, is not the point.  The elitists must keep the public in a constant state of panic in order to control them. Unafraid and compassionate people are impossible to control.Unfortunately and unsurprisingly, the propaganda was injected into schools to eliminate critical thinking.At school, we were taught to think in certain ways. They taught us what to think, but not how to develop our thinking. And everyone was taught the same. If we thought in different ways than our classmates, teachers would tell us we are bad students. They would give us bad grades and might even expel us from school. Therefore, as students we learned to compromise our thinking so as to get away with trouble. –The Bounded Spirit.The other hard truth most will not like to hear is that if you are still stuck in the left vs. right paradigm, you still haven’t figured any of it out yet.

The fear of not electing the right candidate drives people to polls to vote for evil every year. (The lesser of two evils is still evil.) Politicians are being elected by persuading the masses through the use of fear while journalists influence public opinion by terrorizing people’s minds.Fear is the best weapon of all great manipulators. It can move people to do anything, no matter how nonsensical it is.  Take, for example, the COVID-19 scam.  People are still terrified of a virus that even the government has admitted isn’t any worse than the flu.  Why? Because the media, the government’s lapdog, is telling them they still need to be afraid. The elites have learned to manipulate the public’s emotions to their advantage. With global media corporations in place, controlled and operated BY the elite, they can amplify that fear quite easily. Turn on the news, open a newspaper and you’ll see this.We have been taught to be distrustful of the mind, however, and of our thoughts. This has been by design and has been perpetuated through society by the elite of this world who understand the power of thought and the nature of the mind. In fact, most of us have been through a long period of mind-programming since we were born to separate our mind from itself so that it does not know or experience this truth. –With One Breath.Obey.

For instance: did this version of the coronavirus come from a lab?If the idea that the SARS-CoV-2 virus grew at the hands of researchers sounds farfetched to you, get ready to be surprised.  Published research offers evidence which points to a resounding “YES” to the question “was coronavirus manmade?”We, at NaturalHealth365, would like to extend a special thanks to Peter R. Breggin, MD for providing context and inspiration for this article.Prestigious peer-reviewed journal published study results proving that U.S. and Chinese researchers conspired to create deadly manmade coronavirus\n",
      "Five years ago, the respected and peer-reviewed scientific journal Nature Medicine published a paper from a group of U.S. and Chinese researchers who explicitly tinkered with a bat coronavirus in order to see if it could infect humans.The researchers succeeded!The international team hailed from institutions such as Harvard Medical School, the National Center for Toxicological Research of the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Cancer Immunology and AIDS of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and none other than the Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Both the United States and Chinese governments funded the research.In their paper, titled “A SARS-like cluster of circulating bat coronaviruses shows potential for human emergence,” the researchers acknowledged that they “generated and characterized” a virus (called SHC014-CoV) which at the time was circulating in the Chinese horsehoe bat population. Animal and human cell experiments involving the manmade coronavirus then led to evidence of lung damage and other pathologies. Their experiments also determined that “available SARS-based immune-therapeutic and prophylactic modalities revealed poor efficacy” for treatment.In other words, these researchers genetically modified and created an animal-based virus that could be infectious to humans and was impervious to exisiting antiviral treatments, including vaccines which “failed to neutralize and protect from infection.”  Eerily similar to the current global pandemic.And yet:We’re supposed believe a paper published in March of this year – published in the very same journal – which states that genomic investigations of the virus  “irrefutably show” that SARS-CoV-2 did not come from a lab and that it is “improbable that SARS-CoV-2 emerged through laboratory manipulation.”The authors of Nature Medicine‘s March 2020 paper urge people to accept one of two scenarios that more “plausibly explain” the virus’s origin: either natural selection and evolution in an animal host before the virus jumped to humans, or natural selection and evolution in a human host after the virus jumped from animals.We don’t claim to be virologists. All we know is that there are too many unknowns right now. Maybe it’s time for officials to start being way more transparent about this virus’s true origins.Have researchers succeeded in creating the very pandemic monster they were worried about?It’s painfully ironic to think that both the Chinese and United States governments funded (with taxpayer dollars) the laboratory creation of a dangerous and proven deadly pathogen, simply for the apparent purpose to … “prepare” for a future emergence?The level of biosafety and biosecurity risk of such meddling is hard to wrap our head around. It sounds a bit like fighting fire with fire – but makes you wonder who actually is the “winner” in such a fight.Perhaps big pharma and friends pushing for mass vaccinations?“The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV,”  the authors of the 2015 paper write, “underscores the threat of cross-species transmission events leading to outbreaks in humans.”Yet even their own research, in addition to earlier research from related government-funded studies, seemed to downright spook them. The authors conclude that “scientific review panels may deem similar studies … too risky to pursue”  and that “the potential to prepare for and mitigate future outbreaks must be weighed against the risk of creating more dangerous pathogens.”We’re deeply concerned by this revelation and thankful to Dr. Breggin, his scrupulous wife Ginger, and Jef Akst of The Scientist for bringing it to light. It begs the question: what other sorts of experiments are going on in BSL-4 labs like the laboratory in Wuhan?To what extent are government agencies putting the public at dire risk?

      "A molecular biologist proclaimed Thursday that the Chinese coronavirus could have originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, and been leaked, leading to it’s horrific spread around the globe.Richard H. Ebright, a professor of chemical biology at Rutgers University, told The Daily Caller that he believes it is a distinct possibility that an accident in the laboratory in China could have caused the outbreak.Professor Ebright said that “A denial is not a refutation,” referring to China’s top virologist Shi Zhengli, who works at the lab in Wuhan, and has repeatedly denied that it was the source of the pandemic.Zhengli, known as ‘bat-woman’, because she works with bat-borne viruses,  has said that the coronavirus spread is “nature punishing the human race for keeping uncivilized living habits.”“The novel 2019 coronavirus is nature punishing the human race for keeping uncivilized living habits. I, Shi Zhengli, swear on my life that it has nothing to do with our laboratory,” she wrote in early February, adding “I advise those who believe and spread rumors from harmful media sources … to shut their stinking mouths.”\n",
      "Professor Ebright pointed to the quote, noting that it makes Zhengli’s denial more suspect.While the professor has been cited by the likes of The Washington Post and MSNBC to dismiss theories about the virus being a bioweapon, the media has not covered his belief that the possibility of a lab accident being the source of the outbreak “cannot–and should not–be dismissed.”To clarify, Professor Ebright categorically does not believe that the virus is an engineered bioweapon, due to the scientific evidence showing otherwise. However, the notion that the strain of coronavirus that has spread around the world, and since mutated, came from the Wuhan lab is a real possibility in Ebright’s opinion.This notion is also supported by the fact that according to a study contributed to by the ‘bat-woman’ herself, Shi Zhengli, the novel coronavirus is 96.2% identical to a viral strain that was detected in horseshoe bats from the Yunnan Province, which is over 600 miles away from Wuhan.Separate Chinese research confirmed this and cited testimonies from close to 60 people who lived or stayed in Wuhan for lengthy periods, saying that the bat “was never a food source in the city, and no bat was traded in the market.”The research paper, which was uploaded to Research Gate on Feb. 6, concluded that “The killer coronavirus probably originated from a laboratory in Wuhan.”The paper was removed from Research Gate on Feb. 14 or 15, according to internet archives, and it’s author cannot be reached.A deadly virus leak from a Chinese lab is not unprecedented. The SARS virus escaped twice from the Chinese Institute of Virology in Beijing in 2004, one year after its spread was brought under control.Many believe that China’s continued subterfuge regarding the coronavirus outbreak, and it’s bizarre accusations that it was spread by the US military, is an effort to divert attention from the possibility that this virus leaked from the Wuhan lab.Senator Tom Cotton, who has been continually vocal on the matter, told The Daily Caller this week that “The reason I have raised these questions from the very beginning is because of China’s statements and their actions.”“After concealing the virus for many weeks in December and then minimizing its severity for most of January, they then peddle an origin story about the food market in Wuhan.” Cotton said, adding “Given their dishonesty and the proximity of these labs, which we know were working with coronaviruses, it is only reasonable and responsible for us to ask the question and demand the answers.”Molecular Biologist Says COVID-19 Could Have Leaked From Wuhan Biolab\n",

      "In January, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced it would begin funding vaccine candidates for the coronavirus outbreak, long before it became a major global issue. CEPI describes itself as “a partnership of public, private, philanthropic and civil organizations that will finance and co-ordinate the development of vaccines against high priority public health threats” and was founded in 2017 by the governments of Norway and India along with the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. That month, CEPI only chose two pharmaceutical companies to receive funding for their efforts to develop a vaccine for Covid-19 – Moderna and Inovio Pharmaceuticals.As previously mentioned, these two companies are DARPA-backed firms that frequently tout their “strategic alliance” with DARPA in press releases and on their websites. DARPA has also provided these companies with significant amounts of funding. For instance, the top funders behind Inovio Pharmaceuticals include both DARPA and the Pentagon’s Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and the company has received millions in dollars in grants from DARPA, including a $45 million grant to develop a vaccine for Ebola. They were also recently awarded over $8 million from the U.S. military to develop a small, portable intradermal device for delivering DNA vaccines, which was jointly developed by Inovio and the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), which also manages the “biodefense” lab at Fort Detrick.In addition, the German company CureVac, which is also developing a CEPI-backed RNA vaccine for Covid-19, is another long-time recipient of DARPA funding. They were one of DARPA’s earliest investments in the technology, winning a $33.1 million DARPA contract to develop their “RNActive” vaccine platform in 2011.\n",
      "In Moderna’s case, DARPA financed the production and development of their RNA vaccine production platform and their RNA therapy candidate for Chikungunya virus (their first for an infectious disease) was developed in direct collaboration with the agency. Since 2016, Moderna’s RNA vaccine program has received $100 million in funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The Gates Foundation has since poured millions directly into both Moderna’s and Inovio’s Covid-19 vaccine efforts.Gates’ backing of DNA and RNA vaccines is significant, given that Gates – a billionaire with unparalleled influence and control over global healthcare policy – recently asserted that the best options for a Covid-19 vaccine are these same vaccines, despite the fact that they have never before been approved for use in humans. Yet, thanks to the emergency authorizations activated due to the current crisis, both Moderna’s and Inovio’s testing for these vaccines has skipped animal trials and gone straight to human testing. They are also set to be fast-tracked for widespread use in a matter of months. Moderna’s clinical trial in humans began in mid-March, followed by Inovio’s in the beginning of April. Thus, they are not only Gates’ favorites to be the new vaccine, but are also slated to be the first to complete clinical trials and garner emergency U.S. government approval, especially Moderna’s vaccine which is being jointly developed with the government’s NIH.The rapid rise to prominence of Moderna’s and Inovio’s Covid-19 vaccines has resulted in several media articles praising DARPA as having provided our “best hope” for thwarting the coronavirus crisis. In addition to its backing of Moderna’s and Inovio’s own efforts, DARPA itself, specifically DARPA’s BTO, is set to have a “temporary” vaccine for Covid-19 available in a matter of weeks that will involve the production of synthetic antibodies that would ostensibly provide immunity for a few months until a longer-lasting vaccine (such as those produced by Moderna and Inovio) is available.DARPA’s antibody treatment for Covid-19 is pursuing two routes, including the “human body as bio-reactor” approach that would involve synthetic DNA or RNA being injected in order to prompt the body to produce the necessary antibodies. Defense One notes that DARPA’s Covid-19 treatment would utilize techniques that had resulted from the agency’s investments in microfluidics (the manipulation of liquids at the sub-millimeter range), nanotechnology fabrication and “new approaches to gene sequencing.”Persistent Concerns. While most media reports have painted these DARPA-led efforts as entirely positive, it is worth noting that concerns have been raised, though these concerns have hardly gotten the coverage they warrant. For instance, Nature recently noted some key points regarding safety issues related to the race for a Covid-19 vaccine, including the fact that all “previous coronavirus vaccines have not all proven appropriate or even safe,” with some past attempts at coronavirus vaccines having resulted in antibody dependent enhancement (ADE). ADE results in cells more rapidly taking up the virus and speeding up the virus’ replication, increasing its infectiousness and virulence.Nature also noted that the two coronavirus vaccines for SARS that managed to pass phase 1 trials ended up, in subsequent studies, causing immune hypersensitivity in mice “resulting in severe immunopathology,” i.e. permanent defects or malfunctions in the immune system. In addition, Nature also pointed out that it is unknown how strong an immune response is needed to confer immunity for Covid-19 and coronaviruses in general, making it incredibly difficult to gauge if a vaccine is even effective.Another issue worth noting involves concerns raised about Inovio Pharmaceuticals by investment research firm Citron Research, which compared Inovio to Theranos, the disgraced medical technology company that had initially promised to offer diagnoses for numerous diseases via a simple blood test, but was later revealed to be a sham. Citron asserted that “It’s been over 40 years since Inovio was founded, yet the company has NEVER [sic] brought a product to market, and all the while insiders have enriched themselves with hefty salaries and large stock sales.”Citron Research went on to say that the company’s claim to have designed their Covid-19 vaccine in only 3 hours based on a computer algorithm was hard to believe, stating that “Inovio has a ‘computer algorithm’ that no one else in the world has and is arguably one of the greatest breakthroughs in vaccine discovery in the past 100 years, and yet this ‘computer algorithm’ is not mentioned once in any of its 10-K’s or 10-Q’s? Sounds like Theranos to us.” It also noted that Inovio’s partnerships with pharmaceutical companies Roche and AstraZeneca ended up failing with those two companies canceling the partnership despite claims from Inovio’s CEO that whey would “continue to thrive.”A Not-So-Hidden Agenda.Of course, these are just concerns focused on corporate behavior and obstacles towards making a Covid-19 vaccine in general. As this report has already shown in detail, DARPA’s other experiments with the same technologies (particularly genetic engineering, synthetic chromosomes, and nanotechnology) that are being used to produce RNA and DNA vaccines for Covid-19 are arguably more concerning. This is especially true given that DARPA-backed companies that describe themselves as “strategic partners” of the agency are those manufacturing these vaccines. In addition, thanks to backing from the U.S. government and Bill Gate, among others, they are are also slated to be among the first vaccines (if not the first) approved for widespread use.It is certainly troubling that media coverage of DARPA’s efforts and the efforts of Moderna and Inovio have thus far not included critical reporting regarding the different branches of DARPA’s research that has produced the technology involved in creating these vaccines, leaving little room for public scrutiny of their safety, efficacy and their potential for unintended effects on human genetics.This is particularly alarming given that, over the past several weeks, efforts have been taking shape in many countries to enforce mandatory vaccinations once a Covid-19 vaccine becomes available. In some countries, it appears likely that the Covid-19 vaccine will not be made mandatory per say, but will be required for those who wish to return to any semblance of “normalcy” in terms of public gatherings, working certain jobs, leaving one’s home for longer periods of time and so on.Would those involved in creating such a mandatory vaccine, e.g. DARPA, pass up the opportunity to utilize the same technologies involved in producing the vaccine for some of their other admitted goals? This question, of course, has no obvious answer, but the fact that the arc of DARPA’s research is aimed at the weaponization of human biology and genetics in a way that is ripe for misuse, suggests very worrying possibilities that warrant scrutiny. Indeed, if one merely looks at how the crisis has been a boon for the Orwellian plans of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI) and the federal government’s current efforts to dramatically increase its powers amid the current crisis, it becomes increasingly difficult to give government agencies like DARPA and their corporate partners like Moderna and Inovio the benefit of the doubt.This is especially true given that – without a major crisis such as that currently dominating world events – people would likely be unreceptive to the widespread introduction of many of the technologies DARPA has been developing, whether their push to create cyborg “super soldiers” or injectable BMIs with the capability to control one’s thoughts. Yet, amid the current crisis, many of these same technologies are being sold to the public as “healthcare,” a tactic DARPA often uses. As the panic and fear regarding the virus continues to build and as people become increasingly desperate to return to any semblance of normalcy, millions will willingly take a vaccine, regardless of any government-mandated vaccination program. Those who are fearful and desperate will not care that the vaccine may include nanotechnology or have the potential to genetically modify and re-program their very being, as they will only want the current crisis that has upended the world to stop.In this context, the current coronavirus crisis appears to be the perfect storm that will allow DARPA’s dystopian vision to take hold and burst forth from the darkest recesses of the Pentagon into full public view. However, DARPA’s transhumanist vision for the military and for humanity presents an unprecedented threat, not just to human freedom, but an existential threat to human existence and the building blocks of biology itself.Question Everything, Come To Your Own Conclusions.DARPA – Saving us from Covid-19?\n",

      "It started with a light cough. He burped constantly, and complained of shortness of breath. Family members thought it was no big deal. The doctor said he seemed to have heart problems and suggested him to stay in the hospital. He appeared healthy except for a minor infection in one lung area.Two weeks later, he was dead, with both lungs infected and organ failure. His doctors at the Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital determined the cause of death as “unknown pneumonia.” It was days before Chinese health authorities identified the cause of the new viral pneumonia as 2019-nCoV, a coronavirus that first emerged in December in the commercial city of Wuhan, his home city.This is a deadly virus, more deadly so far than the worst viral threats to date and they are locking people up in their own homes in China. For all the latest information see this video. Things are moving fast and events are looking to overtake the world’s health officials, who this time are being aggressive in trying to control it, at least in China.Brandon Smith writes, “I would not be surprised if we discover in the next two weeks that the death tally is in the thousands, and the sickness rate is actually in the hundreds of thousands. The fact that China has now quarantined over 50 million people in 16 cities suggests the danger is much higher than they have admitted. If this is the case, then at the very least, the Chinese economy is about to take a massive hit. If the virus doesn’t spread, the economic damage will.”The official number of those infected by the Wuhan Coronaviris (2019-nCoV) now stands at almost 8000, according to the latest Johns Hopkins CSSE data (already a figure rivaling the 2003 SARS outbreak), with the total number of deaths now standing at 170 (both figures up 29% on the day before). Untold thousands are struggling with the virus in hospitals in China, whose government is promising to build a 1000 bed hospital in one week in Wuhan.It is highly doubtful, the way things are looking, that even if they lock down all the major cities of the world they are not going to control it, but they will do their best to control us. It is already a matter of too little too late and they still are not advising doctors or the public what simple but powerful things people can do to minimize chances of it going critical demanding ICU care. People are dying from the regular flu but if you get the coronavirus you chances of dying are going to be much greater. Believe me you do not want your loved ones to die of the flu this year.This virus is severe, and with flu season in the northern hemisphere in full swing, it is going to be difficult, if you just are coming down with the feelings of the flu, to determine if you have the new coronavirus, or just regular flu, which can also kill you if you are not careful. Coronaviruses are a class of common viruses, causing everything from the common cold to epidemics like severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars).Dr. Grayson also said, “Having YEARS of experience developing an Ebola treatment, I was concerned about this Coronavirus Outbreak from the outset, because this coronavirus strain is very contagious, causes severe illness, and NO treatments or vaccines are available.” Well that’s an admission that he knows of no treatments, or the government has no certified treatment, but that does not mean there are no treatments.Approximately 50% lived through Ebola even though patient were not receiving treatment since doctors did not believe there was a treatment. They are saying the same about the coronavirus and that is completely absurd. There are many strong things one can do to increase the chances of surviving viral infections. If you believe there is little or nothing to do, which is what doctors and health organizations believe, that is exactly what you and they will continue to do, even if it means literally adding to the death rate because of limiting beliefs.Doctors get hysterical about viruses because they refused to learn about, and use, the best and safest treatments for their patients. For example, as early as June 1, 1905 an article was printed in the New York Times[1] about the successful use of iodine for consumption/tuberculosis. Though iodine kills most pathogens on the skin within 90 seconds, its use as an antibiotic/antiviral/antifungal has been completely ignored by modern medicine so we do not hear one word about it as the coronavirus spreads.Iodine exhibits activity against bacteria, molds, yeasts, protozoa, and many viruses; indeed, of all antiseptic preparations suitable for direct use on humans and animals and upon tissues, only iodine is capable of killing all classes of pathogens: gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, yeasts, viruses and protozoa. Most bacteria are killed within 15 to 30 seconds of contact.With iodine in your pocket you don’t have to worry so much about viral infections if you know how to use it effectively. “Extremely high doses of iodine can have serious side effects, but only a small fraction of such extreme doses are necessary to kill influenza viruses,” writes Dr. David Derry of Canada. In 1945, a breakthrough occurred when Dr. J.D. Stone and Sir McFarland Burnet (who later went on to win a Nobel Prize for his Clonal Selection Theory) exposed mice to lethal effects of influenza viral mists. The lethal disease was prevented by putting iodine solution on mice snouts just prior to placing them in chambers containing influenza viruses. Dr. Derry reminds us that a long time ago students in classrooms were protected from influenza by iodine aerosol therapy. Aerosol iodine also is effective against freshly sprayed influenza virus.Dr. David Brownstein says, “Iodine is essential to not only fighting off an infection it is necessary for proper immune system functioning. There is no bacteria, virus, parasite or fungus that is known to be resistant to iodine.”Medicines To Have And Use At Home.There is a short list of medicines used in ICU departments that can be used safely at home to minimize the threat of dying from the coronavirus. Sodium bicarbonate should be stocked in the house and taken, enough so one gets everyone’s urinary pH up to being more alkaline. The body should be literally flooded with magnesium, high dosages of selenium and iodine, potassium (potassium bicarbonate) and even sulfur. Vitamin C and D can also be taken at very high dosages as they sometimes are given in the best ICU treatment centers.Brownstein says vitamin A should be added to this list. He also says, “To prevent becoming ill and to avoid having a poorly responding immune system, it is vitally important to eat a healthy diet free of all sources of refined sugar. Refined sugar has been shown to negatively alter the functioning of the white blood cells for hours after ingestion. Finally, it is important to maintain optimal hydration—drink water!”In the emergency room medicines have to be safe while delivering an instant lifesaving burst of healing power. The idea when used at home is to constantly be administering these medicinals during waking hours when suffering from the flu or the cornonavirus.The power and speed of these medicines and the flexibility of their administration methods make them ideal especially because of their extremely low-toxicity profiles. As usual the key to their use is in the dose given. (Dosages and Treatments for Cornonavirus Infections Coming Tomorrow.) Fewer people will die from the coronavirus, as from any virus, if they are treated correctly.If, God forbid, one comes down with the virus it is good to have a nebulizer on hand so you can get magnesium, iodine and bicarbonate directly into the lungs.Serious Conclusions.Brandon Smith has a lot to say about why we should all be concerned:“Global pandemic, whether a natural event or deliberately engineered, actually serves the purposes of the globalist establishment in a number of ways. First and foremost, it is a superb distraction. The general public, overcome with fears of an invisible force of nature that can possibly kill them at any moment, will probably forget all about the much bigger threat to their life, liberty and future – the subsequent collapse of the massive ‘Everything Bubble’ and the globalist “solution” that a pandemic can trigger.”“The globalist establishment has created the largest financial bubble in modern history through central bank stimulus, inflating a highly unstable artificial rally in markets while also creating new highs in national debt, corporate debt and consumer debt. The economic fundamentals have been sending alarms for the past two years, and the ‘Everything Bubble’ is showing signs of implosion. It is only a matter of time before the farce collapses by itself. The globalists need scapegoats, but they also need an event or wave of events so distracting that people will not be able to discern what really happened.”“The reason why globalists want a collapse is simple – They need crisis in order to manipulate the masses into accepting total centralization, a global monetary system and global governance. They are also rabid believers in eugenics and population reduction. At the very least, a global pandemic is a useful happenstance for them; but the timing of the coronavirus event and their highly accurate “simulation” only three months ago also suggests their potential involvement, as it comes right as the implosion of the Everything Bubble was accelerating.”CORONAVIRUS GUIDANCE: How to successfully manage viral infections and avoid their serious consequences\n",

      "First of all, experts say there has been no study connecting the flu shot with an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19.The central study cited by the Children’s Health Defense is a 2019 Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch study that probed the theory that “influenza vaccination may increase the risk of other respiratory viruses” — a concept known as “virus interference.”Edward Belongia, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the Marshfield Clinic Research Institute, told us that the theory rests on the idea that “if you get a flu infection, for example, maybe for some period of time your immune response to that flu infection reduces your risk of getting infected by some other virus.”\n",
      "Belongia said virus interference has been the subject of speculation and some studies with mixed results, but there is ultimately little data to support it. A 2013 study he worked on, cited in the AFHSB study, found that “influenza vaccination was not associated with detection of noninfluenza respiratory viruses.”In fact, the AFHSB study concluded that its “overall results … showed little to no evidence supporting the association of virus interference and influenza vaccination.”The erroneous claim that the study shows a heightened risk for COVID-19 for those vaccinated for the flu hinges on the study’s suggestion that vaccinated individuals appeared more likely to get “coronavirus.”But the study looked at four types of seasonal coronaviruses that cause common colds, not SARS-CoV-2.What’s more, Belongia said, the results in the study that indicate a flu-vaccinated person has an increased likelihood of testing positive for a seasonal coronavirus do not appear to be adjusted for age groups or seasons. Those factors could affect someone’s chances of getting a specific virus, regardless of whether or not they’ve been vaccinated for the flu.Different viruses affect different age groups and circulate at different times, he said. “It can be easily explained just by random variation and the fact that they didn’t adjust for confounding variables.”The Military Health System, of which the AFHSB is a part, noted in a statement to FactCheck.org that the study used data collected two years before the emergence of COVID-19 and looked at the seasonal coronaviruses — “impacting children and adults with no serious complications” — which “do not have the potential for epidemic or pandemic spread.”“The study does not show or suggest that influenza vaccination predisposes in any way, the potential for infection with the more severe forms of coronavirus, such as COVID-19,” the MHS said.Furthermore, the statement said, “it’s also important to note the study found evidence of significant protection by influenza vaccination against not only multiple forms of the flu, but other, very serious non-influenza viruses, such as parainfluenza, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), and non-influenza virus coinfections. It remains essential for people to obtain the seasonal flu shot each year as it becomes available.”There have been some results suggestive of virus interference, which the Children’s Health Defense cites in its post. But none of the studies referenced assessed risks of the flu shot when it comes to COVID-19.For example, Sharon Rikin, an assistant professor of medicine at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center, said in an email that a 2018 study she worked on “showed an association with flu vaccination and a slightly higher risk of non-flu acute respiratory infections (such as the common cold) in children. However, this association was not seen in adults.”“In medicine, we are always weighing the risks and benefits of treatments. In this case, we know that the flu vaccine is safe and effective to reduce illness and death among children and adults every year,” Rikin added. “We have not studied the association between flu vaccination and risk of COVID-19. Fortunately, COVID-19 is typically not causing significant illness in children. However, preventing illness and death from flu still remains extremely important for children.”Rikin said “just because we found an association between flu vaccines and acute respiratory infections does not mean that the flu vaccine actually caused there to be a higher risk of infections.” She said the group struggled to find a “biologically plausible explanation” and that while “there is a small body of literature that hypothesizes that the phenomenon of shifts in viral prevalence could be caused by viral interference,” there is not “strong empirical evidence of this occurring.”\n",
      "Belongia told us that, ultimately, the evidence of virus interference through such studies “is weak and inconclusive.”“Overall, we do not see evidence of virus interference that is sufficient to raise concerns about flu vaccination and COVID-19 risk,” he said. “Serious COVID-19 disease occurs primarily in adults, and we do not have evidence of flu vaccine causing virus interference in adult age groups.”He said that getting the flu shot, if anything, is especially important because of potential problems posed by the combination of the flu and COVID-19, both for the health care system and individuals.Likewise, Richard Ellison, a professor of medicine at the University of Massachusetts Medical School and hospital epidemiologist at UMass Memorial Medical Center, told us in an email that “getting the flu itself carries very significant morbidity and potentially mortality — so we don’t want someone to get the flu in the first place.”“In addition, while having the flu may boost the immune system, it can significantly weaken someone’s overall health status, and make them more susceptible to complications should they be unfortunate enough to have both influenza and COVID-19 in the same year.”No Evidence That Flu Shot Increases Risk of COVID-19\n",

      "Numerous conspiracy theories shared on and off social media claim that 5G mobile networks are the cause of the novel coronavirus pandemic. This is false; experts told AFP that 5G is based on radio frequency and that this does not create viruses. In one of the most widespread claims, popular American singer Keri Hilson asserted that coronavirus is caused by fifth-generation wireless technology, known as 5G. In a series of now-deleted tweets on March 16, 2020 (archived here), Hilson claimed  COVID-19 was not as widespread in Africa because of the absence of 5G. “People have been trying to warn us about 5G for YEARS. Petitions, organizations, studies…what we’re going through is the effects of radiation. 5G launched in CHINA. Nov 1, 2019. People dropped dead,” she wrote. “Turn off 5G by disabling LTE!!! Why do you think the virus is not happening in Africa like that? Not a 5G region. There may be a few bases there, but not as prevalent as other countries. It has nothing to do with melanin.” Hilson shared a viral YouTube video in which controversial American doctor Thomas Cowan, who remains on probation imposed by the Medical Board of California, argued that the novel coronavirus was created by 5G networks. In his video, Cowan claimed that Wuhan, the city where the novel coronavirus outbreak began, was the first city wholly covered by 5G in the world. Cowan and others who believe his theory claim that China launched 5G in October 2019 — two months before the outbreak started. Some of these claims about 5G causing novel coronavirus have been made in Facebook posts shared hundreds of times, like here and here. 5G coverage Experts differ on which country leads in the commercial use of 5G, but agree that the top nations are China, South Korea (the first to launch in 2019), the United Kingdom and the United States. In late October 2019, China rolled out the commercial use of 5G in 50 cities. Not only did the novel coronavirus not get its start in pioneering South Korea, but the virus has gained a foothold in many countries (for example, Malaysia, Iran, France, Singapore and Nigeria) without 5G networks. 5G does not cause viruses While there have been health concerns regarding the use of 5G networks — and mobile networks in general — owing to radiation, this has nothing to do with the outbreak of viruses, experts told AFP. Speaking to Keri Hilson’s claims, Yusuf Sambo, a researcher at the University of Glasgow who is testing 5G in Scotland, said: “I think she’s an amazing singer, but I am not sure she knows what she’s talking about. Yes, there are fears about the health implications of 5G but they have to do with cancer and not viral infections.” “One of her tweets actually advised people to ‘turn off 5G by disabling LTE’. She is literally saying ‘turn off 5G by disabling 4G’,” said Sambo. Fabien Heliot, a researcher who specialises in electromagnetic exposure in wireless communication at the University of Surrey, explained: “5G, like previous generations of cellular communication systems, is a RF-based (radiofrequency) technology that uses electromagnetic (EM) waveform to transmit information; EM-waveforms are themselves non-ionizing radiations.”  Heliot said the waveforms in 5G are designed and transmitted similarly to 4G. “The main and only difference so far is ... that 5G can transmit more data by using larger frequency bandwidth at higher carrier frequency, and directivity of antennas at the base station.” Being a living thing, a virus cannot be created by radiation, added Heliot. “Actually it is the other way round — there are guidelines put in place to ensure that radiation does not harm living things.” 5G and health. Heliot said that “the possible side-effects of 5G are the same as 4G, 3G, 2G, Wi-Fi; all these wireless communication technologies use EM waveform that radiates energy”. He said 5G radiations are not as severe as “CT scan or x-ray technologies” which are used in medical care. The World Health Organization's website states that “a large number of studies have been performed over the last two decades to assess whether mobile phones pose a potential health risk. To date, no adverse health effects have been established as being caused by mobile phone use”. Regarding 5G, the WHO states: “Health-related conclusions are drawn from studies performed across the entire radio spectrum but, so far, only a few studies have been carried out at the frequencies to be used by 5G. “Tissue heating is the main mechanism of interaction between radiofrequency fields and the human body. Radiofrequency exposure levels from current technologies result in negligible temperature rise in the human body. “As the frequency increases, there is less penetration into the body tissues and absorption of the energy becomes more confined to the surface of the body (skin and eye). Provided that the overall exposure remains below international guidelines, no consequences for public health are anticipated.”Some countries are remaining cautious: In late January, France's Agency for Health and Safety highlighted a need for more data before 5G could be rolled out in the country.

      "Governments love crises because when the people are fearful they are more willing to give up freedoms for promises that the government will take care of them. After 9/11, for example, Americans accepted the near-total destruction of their civil liberties in the PATRIOT Act’s hollow promises of security.It is ironic to see the same Democrats who tried to impeach President Trump last month for abuse of power demanding that the Administration grab more power and authority in the name of fighting a virus that thus far has killed less than 100 Americans.Declaring a pandemic emergency on Friday, President Trump now claims the power to quarantine individuals suspected of being infected by the virus and, as Politico writes, “stop and seize any plane, train or automobile to stymie the spread of contagious disease.” He can even call out the military to cordon off a US city or state.State and local authoritarians love panic as well. The mayor of Champaign, Illinois, signed an executive order declaring the power to ban the sale of guns and alcohol and cut off gas, water, or electricity to any citizen. The governor of Ohio just essentially closed his entire state.The chief fearmonger of the Trump Administration is without a doubt Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health. Fauci is all over the media, serving up outright falsehoods to stir up even more panic. He testified to Congress that the death rate for the coronavirus is ten times that of the seasonal flu, a claim without any scientific basis.On Face the Nation, Fauci did his best to further damage an already tanking economy by stating, “Right now, personally, myself, I wouldn’t go to a restaurant.” He has pushed for closing the entire country down for 14 days.Over what? A virus that has thus far killed just over 5000 worldwide and less than 100 in the United States? By contrast, tuberculosis, an old disease not much discussed these days, killed nearly 1.6 million people in 2017. Where’s the panic over this?If anything, what people like Fauci and the other fearmongers are demanding will likely make the disease worse. The martial law they dream about will leave people hunkered down inside their homes instead of going outdoors or to the beach where the sunshine and fresh air would help boost immunity. The panic produced by these fearmongers is likely helping spread the disease, as massive crowds rush into Walmart and Costco for that last roll of toilet paper.The madness over the coronavirus is not limited to politicians and the medical community. The head of the neoconservative Atlantic Council wrote an editorial this week urging NATO to pass an Article 5 declaration of war against the COVID-19 virus! Are they going to send in tanks and drones to wipe out these microscopic enemies?\n",

      "Technology developed by the Pentagon’s controversial research branch is getting a huge boost amid the current coronavirus crisis, with little attention going to the agency’s ulterior motives for developing said technologies, their potential for weaponization or their unintended consequences.In January, well before the coronavirus (Covid-19) crisis would result in lockdowns, quarantines and economic devastation in the United States and beyond, the U.S. intelligence community and the Pentagon were working with the National Security Council to create still-classified plans to respond to an imminent pandemic. It has since been alleged that the intelligence and military intelligence communities knew about a likely pandemic in the United States as early as last November, and potentially even before then.Given this foreknowledge and the numerous simulations conducted in the United States last year regarding global viral pandemic outbreaks, at least six of varying scope and size, it has often been asked – Why did the government not act or prepare if an imminent global pandemic and the shortcomings of any response to such an event were known? Though the answer to this question has frequently been written off as mere “incompetence” in mainstream media circles, it is worth entertaining the possibility that a crisis was allowed to unfold.Why would the intelligence community or another faction of the U.S. government knowingly allow a crisis such as this to occur? The answer is clear if one looks at history, as times of crisis have often been used by the U.S. government to implement policies that would normally be rejected by the American public, ranging from censorship of the press to mass surveillance networks. Though the government response to the September 11 attacks, like the Patriot Act, may be the most accessible example to many Americans, U.S. government efforts to limit the flow of “dangerous” journalism and surveil the population go back to as early as the First World War. Many of these policies, whether the Patriot Act after 9/11 or WWI-era civilian “spy” networks, did little if anything to protect the homeland, but instead led to increased surveillance and control that persisted long after the crisis that spurred them had ended.Using this history as a lens, it is possible to look at the current coronavirus crisis to see how the long-standing agendas of ever-expanding mass surveillance and media censorship are again getting a dramatic boost thanks to the chaos unleashed by the coronavirus pandemic. Yet, this crisis is unique because it also has given a boost to a newer yet complimentary agenda that — if fulfilled – would render most, if not all, other government efforts at controlling and subduing their populations obsolete.DARPA Dystopia. For years, the Pentagon’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has remained largely out of sight and out of mind for most Americans, as their research projects are rarely covered by the mainstream media and, when they are, their projects are often praised as “bringing science fiction movies to life.” However, there have been recent events that have marred DARPA’s often positive portrayal by media outlets, which paint the agency as a beacon of scientific “progress” that has “changed the world” for the better.For instance, in 2018, a group of European scientists accused the DARPA’s “Insect Allies” program of actually being a dystopian bioweapons program that would see insects introduce genetically modified viruses into plants to attack and devastate a targeted nation’s food supply. DARPA, of course, maintained that its intent to use these insects to genetically modify plants was instead about “protecting” the food supply. Regardless of DARPA’s assertions that it is merely a “defensive” program, it should be clear to readers that such a technology could easily be used either way, depending on the wielder.Though DARPA’s futuristic weapons of war often get the most attention from media, the agency has longstanding interests in tinkering with, not just the biology of plants, but of humans. DARPA, which is funded to the tune of approximately $3 billion a year, has various avenues through which it pursues these ambitions, with many of those now under the purview of the agency’s “Biological Technologies Office” (BTO), created in 2014. As of late, some of DARPA’s human biology and biotech projects at its BTO have been getting a massive PR boost thanks to the current coronavirus crisis, with recent reports even claiming that the agency “might have created the best hopes for stopping Covid-19.”Most of these technologies garnering positive media coverage thanks to Covid-19 were developed several years ago. They include the DARPA-funded platforms used to produce DNA and RNA vaccines, classes of vaccine that has never been approved for human use in the U.S. and involve injecting foreign genetic material into the human body. Notably, it is this very class of vaccine, now being produced by DARPA-partnered companies, that billionaire and global health “philanthropist” Bill Gates recently asserted has him “most excited” relative to other Covid-19 vaccine candidates. Yet, key aspects regarding these vaccines and other DARPA “healthcare” initiatives have been left out of these recent positive reports, likely because they provide a window into what is arguably the agency’s darkest agenda.In 2006, DARPA announced its Predicting Health and Disease (PHD) program, which sought to determine “whether an individual will develop an infectious disease prior to the onset of symptoms.” The PHD program planned to accomplish this by “identifying changes in the baseline state of human health through frequent surveillance” with a specific focus on “viral, upper respiratory pathogens.”\n",
      "Three years later, in 2010, DARPA-funded researchers at Duke University created the foundation for this tool, which would use the genetic analysis of blood samples to determine if someone is infected with a virus before they show symptoms. Reports at the time claimed that these “preemptive diagnoses” would be transmitted to “a national, web-based influenza map” available via smartphone.Following the creation of DARPA’s BTO in 2014, this particular program gave rise to the “In Vivo Nanoplatforms (IVN)” program. The diagnostics branch of that program, abbreviated as IVN:Dx, “investigates technologies that incorporate implantable nanoplatforms composed of bio-compatible, nontoxic materials; in vivo sensing of small and large molecules of biological interest; multiplexed detection of analytes at clinically relevant concentrations; and external interrogation of the nanoplatforms without using implanted electronics for communication.” Past reports on the program describe it as developing “classes of nanoparticles to sense and treat illness, disease, and infection on the inside. The tech involves implantable nanoparticles which sense specific molecules of biological interest.”DARPA’s IVN program has since helped to finance and produce “soft, flexible hydrogels that are injected just beneath the skin to perform [health] monitoring and that sync to a smartphone app to give the use immediate health insights,” a product currently marketed and created by the DARPA-funded and National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded company Profusa. Profusa, which has received millions upon millions from DARPA in recent years, asserts that the information generated by their injectable biosensor would be “securely shared” and accessible to “individuals, physicians and public health practitioners.” However, the current push for a national “contact tracing” system based on citizens’ private health data is likely to expand that data sharing, conveniently fitting with DARPA’s years-old goal of creating a national, web-based database of preemptive diagnoses.Profusa is also backed by Google, which is intimately involved in these new mass surveillance “contact tracing” initiatives, and counts former Senate majority leader William Frist among its board members. They are also partnered with the National Institutes of Health (NIH)The company also has considerable overlap with the diagnostic company Cepheid, which recently won FDA approval for its rapid coronavirus test and was previously awarded lucrative government contracts to detect anthrax in the U.S. postal system. As of this past March, Profusa again won DARPA funding to determine if their injectable biosensors can predict future pandemics, including the now widely predicted “second wave” of Covid-19, and detect those infected up to three weeks before they would otherwise show symptoms. The company expects to have its biosensors FDA licensed for this purpose by early next year, about the same time a coronavirus vaccine is expected to be available to the general public.\n",
      "“Living Foundries”. Another long-standing DARPA program, now overseen by BTO, is known as “Living Foundries.” According to DARPA’s website, Living Foundries “aims to enable adaptable, scalable, and on-demand production of [synthetic] molecules by programming the fundamental metabolic processes of biological systems to generate a vast number of complex molecules that are not otherwise accessible. Through Living Foundries, DARPA is transforming synthetic biomanufacturing into a predictable engineering practice supportive of a broad range of national security objectives.”The types of research this “Living Foundries” program supports involves the creation of “artificial life” including the creation of artificial genetic material, including artificial chromosomes, the creation of “entirely new organisms,” and using artificial genetic material to “add new capacities” to human beings (i.e. genetically modifying humans through the insertion of synthetically-created genetic material).The latter is of particular concern (though all are honestly concerning), as DARPA also has a project called “Advanced Tools for Mammalian Genome Engineering,” which – despite having “mammalian” in the name – is focused specifically on improving “the utility of Human Artificial Chromosomes (HACs),” which DARPA describes as a “fundamental tool in the development of advanced therapeutics, vaccines, and cellular diagnostics.” Though research papers often focus on HACs as a revolutionary medical advancement, they are also frequently promoted as a means of “enhancing” humans by imbuing them with non-natural characteristics, including halting aging or improving cognition.DARPA is known to be involved in research where these methods are used to create “super soldiers” that no longer require sleep or regular meals, among other augmented “features,” and has another program about creating “metabolically dominant” fighters. Reports on these programs also discuss the other, very disconcerting use of these same technologies, “genetic weapons” that would “subvert DNA” and “undermine people’s minds and bodies.”Another potential application being actively investigated by DARPA is its BioDesign program, which is examining the creation of synthetic organisms that are created to be immortal and programmed with a “kill switch” allowing a synthetic, yet organic organism to be “turned off” at any time. This has led some to speculate such research could open the doors to the creation of “human replicants” used for fighting wars and other tasks, such as those that appear in the science fiction film Bladerunner.However, these genetic “kill switches” could also be inserted into actual humans through artificial chromosomes, which – just as they have the potential to extend life – also have the potential to cut it short. Notably, it was revealed in 2017 that DARPA had invested $100 million in “gene drive” research, which is involves the use of genetic modification to wipe out entire populations, explaining why it it often referred to as a “genetic extinction” technology.In addition, other DARPA experiments involve the use of genetically modified viruses that insert genetic material into human cells, specifically neurons in the brain, in order to “tweak” human brain chemistry. In one example, DARPA-funded research has altered human brain cells to produce two new proteins, the first allowing neural activity to be easily detected by external devices and the second allowing “magnetic nanoparticles” to “induce an image or sound in the patient’s mind.”\n",
      "“Next-Generation Nonsurgical Neurotechnology”. Changing human brain chemistry and functionality at the cellular level is only one of numerous DARPA initiatives aimed at changing how human beings think and perceive reality. Since 2002, DARPA has acknowledged its efforts to create a “Brain-Machine Interface (BMI).” Though first aimed at creating “a wireless brain modem for a freely moving rat,” which would allow the animal’s movements to be remotely controlled, DARPA wasn’t shy about the eventual goal of applying such brain “enhancement” to humans in order to enable soldiers to “communicate by thought alone” or remotely control human beings (on the enemy side only, so they say) for the purposes of war.The project, which has advanced greatly in recent years, has long raised major concerns among prominent defense scientists, some of whom warned in a 2008 report that “remote guidance or control of a human being” could quickly backfire were an adversary to gain access to the implanted technology (opening up the possibility of “hacking” a person’s brain), and they also raised concerns about the general ethical perils of such technologies. Work began in 2011 on developing “brain implants” for use in human soldiers, officially with the goal of treating neurological damage in veterans, and such implants have been tested on human volunteers in DARPA-funded experiments since at least 2015.Concerns, like those raised by those defense scientists in 2008, have been regularly dismissed by DARPA, which has consistently claimed that its controversial research projects are tempered by their in-house “ethical experts.” However, it worth noting how DARPA’s leadership views these ethical conundrums, since they ultimately have the last word. For example, in 2015, Michael Goldblatt, then-director of DARPA’s Defense Sciences Office (DSO), which oversees most aspects of the agency’s “super soldier” program, told journalist Annie Jacobsen that he saw no difference between “having a chip in your brain that could help control your thoughts” and “a cochlear implant that helps the deaf hear.” When pressed about the unintended consequences of such technology, Goldblatt stated that “there are unintended consequences for everything.”Thus, it is worth pointing out that, while DARPA-developed technologies – from human genetic engineering to the brain-machine interfaces – are often first promoted as something that will revolutionize and improve human health, DARPA sees the use of these technologies for such ends as being on the same footing as other dystopian and frankly nightmarish applications, like thought control. BMIs are no exception, having first been promoted as a way to “boost bodily functions of veterans with neural damage or post-traumatic stress disorder” and to allow amputees to control advanced prosthetics. While these do indeed represent major medical advances, DARPA’s leadership has made it clear that they see no distinction between the medical use of BMIs and using them to exert near total control over a human being by “guiding” their thoughts and even their movements.Such stark admission from DARPA’s leadership makes it worth exploring the state of these current “brain-machine” interface programs as well as their explicit goals. For instance, one of the goals of DARPA’s Next-Generation Nonsurgical Neurotechnology (N3) program involves using “noninvasive or minimally invasive brain-computer interfaces” to “read and write” directly onto the brain.According to one recent report on DARPA’s N3 program, one example of “minimally invasive” technologies would involve:Coronavirus Gives a Dangerous Boost to DARPA’s Darkest Agenda\n",

That cannot be naturally occurring. Somebody didn’t go to a market, get a bat, the virus didn’t jump directly to humans. That’s not how it works. That’s accelerated viral evolution. If it was a natural occurrence, it would take up to 800 years to occur.

      "Czech theoretical physicist, who was an assistant professor at Harvard University from 2004 to 2007. He writes a science and politics blog called The Reference Frame.Many think Covid-19 is some kind of alien invasion that spells the end of the world. But the real threat to us is a much deadlier virus: a hatred of all the values that have underpinned our civilisation for centuries.For years, I was puzzled as to why the Roman Empire ceased to exist and was replaced by communities that were uncivilized by comparison. How and why could mankind’s progress reverse in this way? Recent experience has eliminated the mystery. No special devastating event was needed; the cause of Rome's demise was simply the loss of its people's desire to support their ‘empire’ and its underlying values. And as it was 1500 years or so ago, so I fear it is now.The Covid-19 crisis – specifically, the reaction to it – demonstrates that people have grown bored, detached, and easily impressionable by things that have nothing to do with the roots of their society. We are all – or too many of us – fin de siècle Romans now.A large number of Westerners are happy to accept the suicidal shutting down of their economies to try to halt a virus that predominantly causes old and sick people to die just a few weeks or months before they would have anyway. Just as they enthusiastically endorse proclamations such as that there are 46 sexes, not two; that the flatulence of a cow must be reduced to save a polar bear; that millions of migrants from the Third World must be invited to Europe and assumed to be neurosurgeons; and so on. The widespread opinion that everything, including economies, must be sacrificed to beat coronavirus is a revival of medieval witch hunts; the sacrifice seems more important than finding an effective method to deal with the problem.Our increasingly decadent mass culture has gradually become more ideological and openly opposed to the values Western civilization is based upon. And while it boasts of being ‘counter-culture’ and independent, it’s acquired a monopoly over almost all the information channels that determine opinions, including mainstream media and political parties.Our leaders have become sucked into this group-thinking and happily institute policies that unleash shutdowns that may cause the worst recession in history. Thousands of businesses are closing and long-term prospects are bleak.Governments are stepping in to pay wages and fund other services. As tax revenue will be virtually non-existent, public debt will soar. Some governments may default on their debts or resort to printing money, causing soaring inflation. These countries may be unable to fund healthcare, their police or their military, and be so weakened they will be invaded by others and be erased from the world map.That may be a worst-case scenario, but it’s almost certain that the impact of the shutdowns will be a recession comparable to the Great Depression. Yet what do most Western citizens make of it? Well, they are either unaware, uncaring, or they’re happy about it. They don’t seem to appreciate the consequent dangers. Instead, they are more obsessed with the latest celebrity who’s caught the virus. The consumers of this mass culture haven't built anything like what our ancestors did – enlightenment, the theory of relativity, parliamentary democracy, industrialisation, major advances in philosophy, science, literature and engineering. They don't have to defend any real values against a tangible enemy, because hiding in a herd with uniform group-think is good enough for them. Our ancestors had difficult, short lives; they had to work hard, produce enough to survive, fight enemies, and defend what they’d inherited. Numerous lasting values emerged from those efforts. The current generations of Westerners are good only at producing and escalating irrationality and panic. If a two-month lockdown isn’t deemed enough to contain the virus, they’re happy to extend it to six months, if not years. China decided to impose strict policies, but they were assertive enough to be relatively short-lived; many Westerners want less perfect policies to last for a much longer time. That’s clearly an irrational approach; instead of ‘flattening a curve’, rational leaders (like Beijing’s) try to turn the curve into a cliff. The faster you eliminate the virus, the cheaper it is.\n",
      "Immortality as an entitlement.This support for economically suicidal policies didn't start with Covid-19. Westerners have spent recent decades amid a prosperity in which they took material wealth and good healthcare for granted. They forgot what hunger (and, in most cases, unemployment) meant. They got used to demanding ever deeper ‘entitlements’, such as the ‘right not to be offended’. Activists sensationalised smaller and more implausible threats and demanded that governments mitigated them. In particular, the climate change movement advocated that the 1-2 °C of warming caused by CO2 emissions in a century was equivalent to an armageddon that had to be avoided, whatever the cost.In this context, it could be expected that the first ‘real challenge’ – and a new flu-like disease is certainly one – would make people fearful. Because if people were led to believe that 1-2 °C of warming was basically the end of the world, is it surprising that they're absolutely terrified of a new disease that has the potential to kill a few million old and sick people? The existential threat posed by coronavirus – or at least, our irrationality towards it – is greater than the climate threat (though still very small). Westerners who haven't seen any real threats for a long time have developed a condition – termed \"affluenflammation\" by the American musician Remy –  which is a pathological habit of inflating negligible threats. When this inflation of feelings is applied to a real threat, namely a pandemic, they lose their composure. The context of Covid-19, where every death is presented with horror, makes it clear that ‘immortality’ is just another ‘human right’. This wisdom says that our leaders are failing because they cannot defend this so-called right. But this excessive sensitivity is just one part of the problem.Many Westerners actively want to harm their economies, corporations, rich people, and governments, because they don't feel any attachment to or responsibility for them. They take security and prosperity for granted. Their money and food arrive from ‘somewhere’, and they don’t care about the source. And they believe that the structures which allow them to survive – the governments, banks, and so on – are ‘evil’. Some are just financially illiterate. But others know what they are saying, and rejoice in demanding that trillions be sacrificed in order to infinitesimally increase the probability that a 90-year-old will avoid infection and live a little bit longer. They don't accept their dependence on society and the system at all. They don't realise that their moral values, their ‘human rights’, are only available if paid for by prosperous societies.I have used some dramatic prose, so let me be clear: the scenario I’ve outlined – ending in the suicide of the West – is avoidable, and I hope and believe it will be. I know some who are willing to fight for its survival. But even if this acceleration towards shutdowns is reversed and countries restore their pre-virus businesses, our world won't be the same. Many people will conclude that the crisis was exciting, and try to kickstart a repetition. The curfew is likely to reduce CO2 emissions this year, so climate activists may try for similar results in the future. Terrorists may deploy some new disease – which, after all, is likely to be more effective than any stabbing or bombing.It's conceivable that the West’s brush with mortality will lead people to regain some common sense and survival instincts. Perhaps several nations going bankrupt will be a wake-up call. Maybe people will realise that the reaction to the coronavirus was disproportionate. But even if that is so, I’m afraid it won’t be enough. We need to accept that the positive relationship of Westerners to the roots of their civilization will be still missing – and that this is a virus that poses a much more fundamental existential threat than Covid-19.Decadent like the late Roman Empire, the West is committing suicide through its irrational response to Covid-19\n",

Kennedy Jr said that Dr. Fauci owns a patent for a specific type of vaccine that packages a virus in a protein sheet. The virus is then delivered to the human body through the vaccine and Kennedy Jr said that it very quickly reaches the organs necessary to give a person immunity to a certain illness. He also said that the patent is currently being used by at least one of the major American vaccine manufacturers to make vaccines for coronavirus. The four major vaccine manufacturers in the US are Pfizer, Merck, GlaxoSmithKline, and Sanofi, and if one of those four companies successfully develops a Coronavirus vaccine, Fauci and the NIAID stand to collect half of the royalties, according to Kennedy Jr.He said that companies who used that patent have to split the profits 50/50 with the NIAID and he claimed that the Gates Foundation had invested in that particular patent. He said that there was no limit on how much the NIAID can collect from the coronavirus vaccine and said that there need to be more government regulations to prevent it from doing so. Robert F.

      "The hysterical overreaction to the coronavirus has driven our own government to virtually shut down the entire country along with its economy. While we must be diligent to do what we can, by washing our hands, not going to work when we’re sick, and taking special precautions for senior citizens with health problems, there is no need, speaking only for myself, to shut down the entire United States to deal with it. While the search for a vaccine continues, the good news is that a silver bullet may have been found, a cheap generic medication that was developed decades ago (in 1944) to deal with malaria. The drug is Chloroquine phosphate, an old-fashioned anti-malarial drug, which has proven effective against Coronavirus in China and South Korea. Says ABC, “Laboratory studies show chloroquine is effective at preventing as well as treating the virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, a close cousin of COVID-19.” There are no less than three studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of chloroquine against the coronavirus. One is a study conducted by James M. Todaro and Gregory J. Rigano, in association with Stanford University School of Medicine and National Academy of Sciences Researchers. \n",
      "Here’s what the summary of their study says (emphasis mine): Recent guidelines from South Korea and China report that chloroquine is an effective antiviral therapeutic treatment against Coronavirus Disease 2019.  Use of chloroquine (tablets) is showing favorable outcomes in humans infected with Coronavirus including faster time to recovery and shorter hospital stay.  US CDC research shows that chloroquine also has strong potential as a prophylactic (preventative) measure against coronavirus in the lab, while we wait for a vaccine to be developed.  Chloroquine is an inexpensive, globally available drug that has been in widespread human use since 1945 against malaria, autoimmune and various other conditions. The study concludes this way: Chloroquine can both prevent and treat malaria.  Chloroquine can both prevent and treat coronavirus in primate cells.  According to South Korean and China human treatment guidelines, chloroquine is effective in treating COVID-19.  Given chloroquine’s human safety profile and existence, it can be implemented today in the U.S., Europe and the rest of the world.  Medical doctors may be reluctant to prescribe chloroquine to treat COVID-19 since it is not FDA approved for this use.  The United States of America and other countries should immediately authorize and indemnify medical doctors for prescribing chloroquine to treat COVID-19.  We must explore whether chloroquine can safely serve as a preventative measure prior to infection of COVID-19 to stop further spread of this highly contagious virus. \n",
      "Chloroquine can be prescribed to adults and children of all ages. It can also be safely taken by pregnant women and nursing mothers. The fact that it can be prescribed for patients of all ages means our priority should be to make this available as soon as humanly possible to senior citizens who are the most vulnerable demographic. Here is the abstract from a study conducted in China:The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) virus is spreading rapidly, and scientists are endeavoring to discover drugs for its efficacious treatment in China. Chloroquine phosphate, an old drug for treatment of malaria, is shown to have apparent efficacy and acceptable safety against COVID-19 associated pneumonia in multicenter clinical trials conducted in China. The drug is recommended to be included in the next version of the Guidelines for the Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Pneumonia Caused by COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China for treatment of COVID-19 infection in larger populations in the future. And here is an abstract from a study reported in the journal Nature. It’s titled ‘Remdesivir and chloroquine effectively inhibit the recently emerged novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in vitro.’Chloroquine, a widely-used anti-malarial and autoimmune disease drug, has recently been reported as a potential broad-spectrum antiviral drug. Chloroquine is known to block virus infection by increasing endosomal pH required for virus/cell fusion, as well as interfering with the glycosylation of cellular receptors of SARS-CoV. Our time-of-addition assay demonstrated that chloroquine functioned at both entry, and at post-entry stages of the 2019-nCoV infection in Vero E6 cells... Chloroquine is widely distributed in the whole body, including lung, after oral administration...Chloroquine is a cheap and a safe drug that has been used for more than 70 years and, therefore, it is potentially clinically applicable against the 2019-nCoV.Well, if the problem is FDA approval for this use, Trump can direct the FDA to accelerate the approval process and get this thing in circulation. And the beauty here is that the drug could be prescribed today, right now. No need to wait. Trump should persuade Congress to immediately authorize doctors to prescribe it, and indemnify them against any lawsuits. Because chloroquine is a generic drug, no pharmaceutical companies will have any interest in producing it since they can’t make any money off it. They’ll want to convince us all that the only solution is a vaccine, which hasn’t even been approved yet. By the time we wait for all that to happen, there may be many lives lost and no economy left to save. The UK has actually banned the export of chloroquine, likely because they know it works and they want to have existing supplies in reserve for their own citizens. Britain first and all that. Medical professionals in both China and South Korea have developed effective treatment measures using chloroquine for patients with COVID-19, so there’s no need to reinvent the wheel. The drug works. “Studies showed ‘certain curative effect’ with ‘fairly good efficacy’ … patients treated with chloroquine demonstrated a better drop in fever, improvement of lung CT images, and required a shorter time to recover” than untreated patients. So it can actually cure people who have coronavirus, end their fevers, and shorten their time in hospital. This can keep our health system from getting overloaded and collapsing under its own weight. If the drug is preventative as well as curative, you would expect to find the countries that have malaria, and therefore have used chloroquine for decades, would have lower rates of Coronavirus if this theory is correct. Dr. Roy Spencer plotted the data for 234 countries, comparing total cases of COVID-19 to the incidence of malaria. He was astonished at what he found. In the top 40 malaria countries, with an average of 212 cases of malaria per thousand, the rate of COVID-19 is 0.2 cases per thousand. In the 153 countries with no malaria, the rate is 68.7 cases of Coronavirus per thousand. When Dr. Spencer mapped all this out, the conclusion was unambiguous: “COVID-19 is where malaria is not.” Said Dr. Spencer, “In all my years of data analysis I have never seen such a stark and strong relationship: Countries with malaria basically have no COVID-19 cases.” This is where Congress could actually do something intelligent by taking some of the billions and billions and billions of dollars they are mindlessly throwing at this problem and targeting it to fund mass production of this medicine. Nobody will mind if they provide a profit margin to Big Pharma in the process if it will save countless lives and pull our economy back from the abyss while we wait for the vaccine. Since chloroquine can not only prevent the disease but cure it, we can begin to see immediate effects. We can get past this irrational, out-of-control, economy-destroying hysteria, save lives, and get the American economy back on its feet and humming in weeks, not months. There is no time to lose.

      "Robert Kennedy Jr. claims that Bill Gates owns the World Health Organization (WHO) and called the Microsoft founder \"the most powerful man in public health.\"\n",
      "Kennedy Jr., the son of Robert F. Kennedy and the nephew of John F. Kennedy, made the claims in an interview on YouTube channel Valuetainment, on May 2, 2020. Kennedy claimed that Gates provides 10% of the WHO's budget and said that the WHO \"begs and rolls over\" for Gates' funding. He claimed that Gates had used his influence to shift the WHO's approach to disease eradication. Kennedy said that the WHO used to employ a policy of eliminating disease by eliminating poverty. He said that the best way of eliminating a disease was by providing impoverished communities with adequate resources, like clean water, sanitation, and sufficient and nutritional food. However, he alleges that Gates has shifted this approach. Kennedy claims that Gates has shifted the WHO's attention toward eradicating disease through vaccination. \"He believes the only path to good health is inside a syringe,\" Kennedy claimed in the two-hour-long interview. Half of the WHO's budget goes towards Gates' polio vaccine program, according to Kennedy, who alleges that the vaccine is actually spreading polio. He alleged that the Gates Foundation's polio vaccine has caused polio epidemics around the world in places that have not seen polio for decades and said that 70% of polio cases on earth are coming from the Gates vaccine. \"I think that Gates is well-intended in the same way that missionaries who brought smallpox to the Indians were well-intended. I think he believes that he is somehow ordained divinely to bring salvation to the world through technology.\" Bill Gates has donated more than $300 million to develop a COVID-19 vaccine and aims to introduce a Global Vaccine Action Plan to combat disease around the world. Kennedy also weighed in with some outrageous theories about the new 5G network, which is currently being rolled out across the world. He said that Bill Gates would have \"complete control of our society\" through 5G. Kennedy alleged that Gates has invested heavily in 5G networks and owns hundreds of thousands of ground antennae. Kennedy claimed that authorities would use 5G to track movements to know where an individual is at any given moment. \"5G is not about helping you download your video game quickly,\" he said. \"5G is about surveillance and it's about data harvesting.\" He said that the current lockdown measures that are in place during the COVID-19 pandemic are training society to do what it's told. \"This pandemic is teaching us to accept this kind of surveillance, to accept these constraints on our civil rights, to allow the government to come in and tell us that we must stay at home and not send our kids to school.\" Perhaps Kennedy's most outrageous claim was that Bill Gates is installing chips in people across America. He said that these chips could be used to store a person's medical records but said that they would be used for something far more sinister. He said that a police officer could potentially scan the chip in the middle of an investigation to search a person's criminal record or their previous locations. Reuters published an article on May 5 debunking Kennedy's microchip claim. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is known for his controversial and bizarre theories.He is notoriously and controversially anti-vaccination and his own family members penned an op-ed in Politico last year challenging his campaign of \"misinformation\" about vaccination.

      "The southern parts of Italy and Spain are becoming the “African“ slums of Europe, where hundreds of thousands of African migrant workers live under circumstances similar to, or perhaps even worse than, the slaves who worked on US cotton farms in the the 19th century. The supermarkets are full of cheap fruits and vegetables. Most of the goods come from Spain, but Italy is also an important supplier. How can countries produce so cheaply? A video reveals catastrophic working conditions. Spain and Italy provide us, the Europeans, with cheap fruits and vegetables, oranges, mandarins, tomatoes, and cucumbers. The big supermarkets of Europe, like Aldi, REWE, Lidl,Carrefour, Albert-Hein (called Albert in Eastern European countries) dictate the prices to the companies in Spain and Italy, who are subsidized by the European Union (EU). The EU has created a slave working force in the southern countries and subsidizes the big companies there with EU tax money. It makes you wonder and explains, on the other hand, the EU migration policy. They want “new” working slaves, like in Roman times, to provide the bourgeoisie with cheap fresh food and vegetables. The work on the fruit and vegetable farms, proposed by companies and accepted by workers, is without any contract. It's also without insurance and security guarantees in the workplace. The irregular migrants (those without legal permits) are being exploited by accepting these forms of work. Because they are working without a contract, they cannot ask for a residence permit, and vice versa; on the other hand, because they cannot claim rights as workers, except in cases where physical violence is suffered, they therefore remain victims of serious labor exploitation. Almeria, the southern part of Spain, hosts the biggestslums, which are set on an arid patch of wasteland outside the small town of San Isidro. Almeria hosts the world's largest concentration of greenhouses. Covering over 31000 hectares (76600 acres) and visible from space, Almeria's \"sea of plastic\" produces roughly 3.5 million tonnes of fruit and vegetables per year. According to the regional distribution company Agrosol, 61% of Almeria's production is exported, with 99.8% bound for Europe – the Netherlands (13.55%), France (13.5%) and the UK (11.4%) being the top markets. Tomatoes: Germany (253603412 tonnes), the UK (145786239 tonnes) and the Netherlands (108809177 tonnes) Pepper: Germany (289784484 tonnes), France (117876979 tonnes) and the Netherlands (91559489 tonnes) Cucumber: Germany (176469357 tonnes), the Netherlands (63069737 tonnes) and the UK (59003974 tonnes). This leads to a weird situation. Whoever in the Netherlands thinks that they're eating Dutch tomatoes is tricked since it’s all from the slave market in Spain. In reality, what is referred to as Almeria's \"economic miracle\" among Spanish economists, is almost exclusively dependent on an invisible, expendable, illegally employed migrant worker force working under 40-degree heat and extreme humidity. They live in slums, and when they can't cope anymore, another boat of \"refugees\" is waiting to come ashore and replace them. Coronavirus The coronavirus is getting out of control in the EU, especially in Italy and Spain. With these two being the suppliers of nearly all our fruit and vegetables, Europe may face a shortage of these products. Since a few days ago, there are riots in Southern Italy, a bad sign for the EU's import of fruits and vegetables from the slave market. If the lockdown continues, the prices will increase. On the other hand, the harvest of asparagus and apples is in danger in Germany and the Netherlands because these EU countries are dependent on the labor force from Romania, Bulgaria, and Poland. They harvest the asparagus and apples since there are no German or Dutch workers who want to do these kinds of jobs. The EU is at its end, which is painfully clear. Like in the old Roman Empire, the Vandalen brought upheaval to the Empire and eventually it broke down. This is what we see right now. The EU countries are unable to help each other, getting help from Russia and China instead, which the EU governments try to label as propaganda. The healthcare system has broken down a long time already. They don’t have masks, no electronic fever thermometers, and are imposing martial law. When they continue with the lockdown, it will be the end of Europe as we knew it. Russia and China will rise, and more and more EU countries know that “brotherhood” is non-existent. The slave workers will move on, and Europe will face the biggest crisis that it's ever seen.The Slums Of Southern Europe, The New Slave Market Of The EU, And The Coronavirus\n",

      "Bobby Kennedy Jr., the son of the late former US Attorney General and the nephew of the late President John F. Kennedy, is warning the world of the perils of vaccinations. He claims the push for more vaccines is all about the money.Bobby Kennedy Jr. was on a podcast this past week where he dropped some bombs about the perils of vaccinations.  In his interview at the 50:00 minute mark, Kennedy shares the following:You have the Vaccine Act of 86.  Now you have a project that has no liability so they have no incentive to make it safe.  Not only that they don’t have to test it and in fact they have an incentive not to test it because the only way you can get sued under the Vaccine Act is if you can show that the company knew of an injury and didn’t list it on the manufacturer’s insert.So there’s an incentive to know as little about the product as possible.  And, you can’t sue them, and there’s no market force that keeps them in check.  Because you can say that the vaccine is mandated for 78 million kids.  And, so the industry got together and manufacturers said, holy cow, now we have a product that has no liability, and that’s the biggest cost for drugs.  So they said, number one, we don’t have to test it, that’s a huge cost avoided.  Number two, there’s no liability and that’s the biggest cost avoided.  Number three, there’s no marketing or advertising costs, because it’s mandated.  So it’s just like printing money.If you can get a vaccine on the CDC’s recommended schedule it averages about a billion dollars annually in pure profits for your company .  When I was a kid I got three vaccines and was fully compliant and today’s kids get 72 vaccines.At the 59:00 minute mark, Kennedy shares the money and connections between Dr. Fauci and the Gates Foundation:Tony Fauci has many, many vaccine patents… and there’s one vaccine patent that he has that is a way of packaging a coronavirus with some other vaccine … in a protein sheet… and then delivering it through a vaccine… he somehow ended up owning that patent… Tony Fauci will be able to cash in …. So Fauci’s agency will collect half the royalties for that vaccine [related to the coronavirus].The above audio was shocking in describing the connections between Fauci and Gates and the alleged money they may make with a vaccine for the coronavirus.Bobby Kennedy Jr. Claims Dr. Fauci and Gates Foundation Will Make Billions on Coronavirus Vaccine\n",

It is two different types of viruses. So not now the flu shot works for all viruses? Concerningly, the latest research shows that getting the flu vaccine increases the risk of getting the coronavirus by 36%!!! Here’s the first link: “Influenza Vaccination and Respiratory Virus Interference Among Department of Defense Personnel During the 2017-2018 Influenza Season. “Flu Vaccine Increases Coronavirus Risk 36% Says Military Study”. “Examining non-influenza viruses specifically, the odds of both coronavirus and human metapneumovirus in vaccinated individuals were significantly higher when compared to unvaccinated individuals (OR = 1.36 and 1.51, respectively) (Table 5).” Paraphrasing, the study highlights the value of the human body’s ability to fight against viruses. Apparently, by contracting influenza, the body naturally “may reduce the risk of non-influenza respiratory viruses…” “While influenza vaccination offers protection against influenza, natural influenza infection may reduce the risk of non-influenza respiratory viruses by providing temporary, non-specific immunity against these viruses. On the other hand, recently published studies have described the phenomenon of vaccine-associated virus interference; that is, vaccinated individuals may be at increased risk for other respiratory viruses because they do not receive the non-specific immunity associated with natural infection.” Like I blogged about before, the flu shot is known to actually suppress your immune system.The flu shot increases by 36% the risk of having the coronavirus.\n",

      "As of March 3, the coronavirus mortality rate is 3.4% according to an estimate by the WHO. However, the media is doing a good job at scaring people. Most people are panic, instead of preparing for the virus. Unfortunately fear-driven media hype is not supported by facts or science.First, the media is telling us to fear “the Coronavirus,” as if it were some ominous new pathogen of which medical science has no understanding. However, what the media failed to tell the public is what World Health Organization (WHO)—now also fanning the flames of fear—explained on its own website: “Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans.”Let that sink in for a moment. In other words, even the common cold is caused by a corona virus. There is no such thing, then, as “the coronavirus.” This new strain of coronavirus, causing an illness ominously labelled COVID-19 as if it were some sort of world-ending plague from a science fiction movie, is just a variation on an old epidemiological theme. (COVID-19 is actually shorthand for a “coronavirus disease” first discovered in 2019). Here are some facts about coronovirus: Human coronaviruses, which are named for the crown-like spikes on their surface were first identified in the mid-1960s, according to information from CDC. The seven coronaviruses that can infect people are:Common human coronaviruses.229E (alpha coronavirus).NL63 (alpha coronavirus).OC43 (beta coronavirus).HKU1 (beta coronavirus). Other human coronaviruses. MERS-CoV (the beta coronavirus that causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS). SARS-CoV (the beta coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS).SARS-CoV-2 (the novel coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19).According to CDC, people around the world commonly get infected with human coronaviruses 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1. Sometimes coronaviruses that infect animals can evolve and make people sick and become a new human coronavirus. Three recent examples of this are 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. It is time to listen to doctors and not the media.As WHO further observes: “Human coronaviruses are common throughout the world. The most recent coronavirus, COVID-19, was first identified in Wuhan, China and is associated with mild-to-severe respiratory illness with fever and cough.” But so is garden variety flu, which causes vastly more deaths every year in every nation than COVID-19 has shown itself to be capable of causing. Yet the lying media breathlessly report “rising death tolls from the [sic] coronavirus” as if COVID-19 were the beginning of an apocalypse. As of this writing, there have been only 26 deaths from “the coronavirus” in the United States, 19 of them occurring in the same senior living facility in Washington State, while the common flu has already claimed 17000 lives throughout the country since the current U.S. flu season began last October.Moreover, as the CDC noted before it too began contributing to the current hysteria, “influenza has resulted in between 9 million-45 million illnesses, between 140000-810000 hospitalizations and between 12000-61000 deaths annually since 2010.” And for the 2019-2020 flu season the CDC had already predicted 34000000-49000000 flu illnesses, 16000000-23000000 flu medical visits, 350000-620000 flu hospitalizations and 20000-52000 flu deaths in the United States.\n",
      "So, it appears that the number of potential US deaths from COVID-19 will be a tiny drop in a large bucket of seasonal viral illness. That truth is buried deep in the middle paragraphs of the lying media’s fake news reports festooned with hysteria-inducing headlines. For example, there is a fear-mongering Bloomberg News report—no coincidence there—with the terrifying headline “There is a ‘Tipping Point’ Before Coronavirus Kills.” One has to wade five paragraphs into the piece to learn that “[a]bout 10-15% of mild-to-moderate patients progress to severe and of those, 15-20% progress to critical.”In other words, critical cases of COVID-19 amount to around 15% of 15%, or 2.25%. Assuming the death toll among that 2.25% is not 100%, the probable death toll from COVID-19 is far lower than that for critical cases of common influenza. As the CDC reported, during the 2018-2019 flu season “900000 people were hospitalized, and more than 80000 people died from flu…” That’s a mortality rate just shy of nine percent for critical cases of the flu requiring hospitalization, and the vast majority of those deaths are among the elderly.Also buried in the same article is the advice of Jeffery K. Taubenberger, Senior Investigator for the National Institutes of Health (NIH), that “The clinical picture suggests a pattern of disease that’s not dissimilar to what we might see in influenza.”Remember the swine flu pandemic of 2009-2010? It was caused by the H1N1 flu virus, which “infected nearly 61 million people in the United States and caused 12469 deaths” and up to 575400 deaths worldwide, according to the CDC.What about the rest of the world? According to the CDC and the prestigious British medical journal The Lancet, worldwide “[s]easonal flu kills 291000 to 646000 people… each year.” That is, the greatest viral threat to human life on the planet, by many orders of magnitude, is and always has been the common flu, not any strain of coronavirus. By comparison, the more virulent but far less contagious coronaviruses causing MERS and SARS have claimed lives only in the hundreds worldwide with very few or zero reported cases after the initial outbreaks in 2012 and 2003, respectively.Here too the lying media bury the truth. One has to scour the Internet to find in the obscure journal Stat the telling comment by WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus that “We don’t even talk about containment for seasonal flu — it’s just not possible. But it is possible for Covid-19. We don’t do contact-tracing for seasonal flu — but countries should do it for Covid-19, because it will prevent infections and save lives. Containment is possible.”But why should the lives of individuals and nations be turned upside down to contain a virus far less lethal, or at least no more lethal, than a typical flu, which cannot be contained? There is no sensible answer other than the promotion of a panic narrative that clearly serves aims other than those of public health and safety.While the lying media consistently fail to mention the large death tolls from influenza nationally and worldwide every year—mounting right now—they are striving to provoke worldwide mass quarantines, travel restrictions, employee furloughs and event cancellations based on 26 deaths thus far from COVID-19 in the United States and 3398 deaths worldwide, the majority of which are in mainland China, followed by South Korea, Iran and Italy. Compare this with the average of 646000 deaths worldwide per year from influenza. In the end, what is really terrifying is not COVID-19, but rather the prospect that the demagogues might well succeed in exploiting it to achieve their end. The media is not about to let a good coronavirus go to waste.Part of this story was originally Published in Fetzen Fliegen.

      "Scientists cast doubt on the Trump-backed theory that the coronavirus escaped from a Chinese lab. Why are the origins of the pandemic so controversial?\n",
      "How Covid-19 began has become increasingly contentious, with the US and other allies suggesting China has not been transparent about the origins of the outbreak.Donald Trump, the US president, has given credence to the idea that intelligence exists suggesting the virus may have escaped from a lab in Wuhan, although the US intelligence community has pointedly declined to back this up. The scientific community says there is no current evidence for this claim.This follows reports that the White House had been pressuring US intelligence community on the claim, recalling the Bush administration’s pressure to “stove pipe” the intelligence before the war in Iraq.What’s the problem with the Chinese version?A specific issue is that the official origin story doesn’t add up in terms of the initial epidemiology of the outbreak, not least the incidence of early cases with no apparent connection to the Wuhan seafood market, where Beijing says the outbreak began. If these people were not infected at the market, or via contacts who were infected at the market, critics ask, how do you explain these cases?Two laboratories in Wuhan studying bat coronaviruses have come under the spotlight. The Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) is a biosecurity level 4 facility – the highest for biocontainment – and the level 2 Wuhan Centre for Disease Control, which is located not far from the fish market, had collected bat coronavirus specimens.Several theories have been promoted. The first, and wildest, is that scientists at WIV were engaged in experiments with bat coronavirus, involving so-called gene splicing, and the virus then escaped and infected humans. A second version is that sloppy biosecurity among lab staff and in procedures, perhaps in the collection or disposal of animal specimens, released a wild virus.Is there any evidence the virus was engineered?The scientific consensus rejecting the virus being engineered is almost unanimous. In a letter to Nature in March, a team in California led by microbiology professor Kristian Andersen said “the genetic data irrefutably shows that [Covid-19] is not derived from any previously used virus backbone” – in other words spliced sections of another known virus.Far more likely, they suggested, was that the virus emerged naturally and became stronger through natural selection. “We propose two scenarios that can plausibly explain the origin of Sars-CoV-2: natural selection in an animal host before zoonotic [animal to human] transfer; and natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer.”Peter Ben Embarek, an expert at the World Health Organization in animal to human transmission of diseases, and other specialists also explained to the Guardian that if there had been any manipulation of the virus you would expect to see evidence in both the gene sequences and also distortion in the data of the family tree of mutations – a so-called “reticulation” effect.In a statement to the Guardian, James Le Duc, the head of the Galveston National Laboratory in the US, the biggest active biocontainment facility on a US academic campus, also poured cold water on the suggestion.“There is convincing evidence that the new virus was not the result of intentional genetic engineering and that it almost certainly originated from nature, given its high similarity to other known bat-associated coronaviruses,” he said.What about an accidental escape of a wild sample because of poor lab safety practices?The accidental release of a wild sample has been the focus of most attention, although the “evidence” offered is at best highly circumstantial.The Washington Post has reported concerns in 2018 over security and management weakness from US embassy officials who visited the WIV several times, although the paper also conceded there was no conclusive proof the lab was the source of the outbreak.Le Duc, however, paints a different picture of the WIV. “I have visited and toured the new BSL4 laboratory in Wuhan, prior to it starting operations in 2017- … It is of comparable quality and safety measures as any currently in operation in the US or Europe.”He also described encounters with Shi Zhengli, the Chinese virologist at the WIV who has led research into bat coronaviruses, and discovered the link between bats and the Sars virus that caused disease worldwide in 2003, describing her as “fully engaged, very open and transparent about her work, and eager to collaborate”.\n",
      "Maureen Miller, an epidemiologist who worked with Shi as part of a US-funded viral research programme, echoed Le Duc’s assessment. She said she believed the lab escape theory was an “absolute conspiracy theory” and referred to Shi as “brilliant”.Problems with the timeline and map of the spread of the virus. While the experts who spoke to the Guardian made clear that understanding of the origins of the virus remained provisional, they added that the current state of knowledge of the initial spread also created problems for the lab escape theory.When Peter Forster, a geneticist at Cambridge, compared sequences of the virus genome collected early in the Chines outbreak – and later globally – he identified three dominant strains.Early in the outbreak, two strains appear to have been in circulation at roughly at the same time – strain A and strain B – with a C variant later developing from strain B.But in a surprise finding, the version with the closest genetic similarity to bat coronavirus was not the one most prevalent early on in the central Chinese city of Wuhan but instead associated with a scattering of early cases in the southern Guangdong province.Between 24 December 2019 and 17 January 2020, Forster explains, just three out of 23 cases in Wuhan were type A, while the rest were type B. In patients in Guangdong province, however, five out of nine were found to have type A of the virus.“The very small numbers notwithstanding,” said Forster, “the early genome frequencies until 17 January do not favour Wuhan as an origin over other parts of China, for example five of nine Guangdong/Shenzhen patients who had A types.”In other words, it still remains far from certain that Wuhan was even necessarily where the virus first emerged.If there is no evidence of engineering and the origin is still so disputed, why are we still talking about the Wuhan labs theory?The pandemic has exacerbated existing geopolitical struggles, prompting a disinformation war that has drawn in the US, China, Russia and others.Journalists and scientists have been targeted by people with an apparent interest in pushing circumstantial evidence related to the virus’s origins, perhaps as part of this campaign and to distract from the fact that few governments have had a fault-free response.What does this mean now?The current state of knowledge about coronavirus and its origin suggest the most likely explanation remains the most prosaic. Like other coronaviruses before, it simply spread to humans via a natural event, the starting point for many in the scientific community including the World Health Organization.Further testing in China in the months ahead may eventually establish the source of the outbreak. But for now it is too early.Where did Covid-19 come from? What we know about its origins\n",

      "Seriously sick coronavirus patients in New York state's largest hospital system are being given massive doses of vitamin C — based on promising reports that it's helped people in hard-hit China, The Post has learned.Dr. Andrew G. Weber, a pulmonologist and critical-care specialist affiliated with two Northwell Health facilities on Long Island, said his intensive-care patients with the coronavirus immediately receive 1500 milligrams of intravenous vitamin C.Identical amounts of the powerful antioxidant are then re-administered three or four times a day, he said.Comment: 1500mg three or four times per day is not a \"massive dose\". That's 4.5 - 6 grams; standard operating procedure when someone has a cold or flu. If they're going to the trouble of doing intravenous C, it would behoove them to do an actual large dose; something not achievable via the oral route.Each dose is more than 16 times the National Institutes of Health's daily recommended dietary allowance of vitamin C, which is just 90 milligrams for adult men and 75 milligrams for adult women.The regimen is based on experimental treatments administered to people with the coronavirus in Shanghai, China, Weber said.\"The patients who received vitamin C did significantly better than those who did not get vitamin C,\" he said.\"It helps a tremendous amount, but it is not highlighted because it's not a sexy drug.\"A spokesman for Northwell — which operates 23 hospitals, including Lenox Hill Hospital on Manhattan's Upper East Side — said that vitamin C was being \"widely used\" as a coronavirus treatment throughout the system, but noted that medication protocols varied from patient to patient.\n",
      "\"As the clinician decides,\" spokesman Jason Molinet said.About 700 patients are being treated for coronavirus across the hospital network, Molinet said, but it's unclear how many are getting the vitamin C treatment.The vitamin C is administered in addition to such medicines as the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, the antibiotic azithromycin, various biologics and blood thinners, Weber said.As of Tuesday, New York hospitals have federal permission to give patients a cocktail of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin to desperately ill patients on a \"compassionate care\" basis.President Trump has tweeted that the unproven, combination therapy has \"a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine.\"Weber, 34, said vitamin C levels in coronavirus patients drop dramatically when they suffer sepsis, an inflammatory response that occurs when their bodies overreact to the infection.\"It makes all the sense in the world to try and maintain this level of vitamin C,\" he said.A clinical trial into the effectiveness of intravenous vitamin C on coronavirus patients began Feb. 14 at Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the pandemic.Comment: Finally, something that actually makes sense in this COVID-19 mess! It's nice to see that at least some hospitals are taking seriously the reports coming from doctors in Wuhan, testifying to the effectiveness of vitamin C. Hopefully, they'll up the dose and see how miraculous this stuff really is.New York hospitals treating coronavirus patients with vitamin C\n",

      "Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) task force head Dr. Anthony Fauci doesn’t want Americans taking hydroxychloroquine, or chloroquine, to treat the virus, and many people are wondering why not?One of them is White House economic advisor Peter Navarro, who reportedly exploded at Fauci the other day for trying to downplay the benefits of this extremely inexpensive generic drug for malaria, while emphasizing the alleged superiority of some future vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) that doesn’t even exist yet.Even though hydroxychloroquine is shaping up to be the most effective weapon in the arsenal – at least from a pharmaceutical perspective – for treating this coronavirus, Fauci isn’t having any of it. And that’s because, as he’s now proven, he works for Big Vaccine and not for the American people.\n",
      "During a recent roundtable, which was reportedly attended by Wuhan coronvirus (COVID-19) response coordinator Deborah Birx, Jared Kushner, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf, and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) acting commissioner Stephen Hahn, Navarro passed out folders containing data on the benefits of hydroxychloroquine.According to Navarro and what he passed out, the studies he’s seen, mostly from overseas, show that this malaria drug shows “clear therapeutic efficacy” against the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), and it can be procured for just pennies per dose.Almost immediately, Fauci began pushing back against Navarro’s claims, stating that “there’s only anecdotal evidence” that hydroxychloroquine works against COVID-19. This “just set Peter off,” according to one of the others who was present, prompting Navarro to explain that “science, not anecdote” shows that hydroxychloroquine does, in fact, work against the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).Listen below to The Health Ranger Report as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, talks to Dr. Eduard Fatakhov about how to beat the coronavirus through nutrition:Navarro also called out Fauci for opposing Trump’s early travel restrictions.In his heated rant against Fauci’s nonsense, Navarro went on to chastise Fauci for being one of the earliest voices to oppose President Donald Trump’s early travel restrictions with China, emphasizing that Fauci had claimed that “travel restrictions don’t work.”The group ended up agreeing that the best path forward is to get the drug to the “hot zones” because it does help, and to allow patients to make the decision whether or not to use hydroxychloroquine themselves with the guidance of their physicians.During a recent press conference, President Trump also indicated that he had ordered 29 million doses of hydroxychloroquine to be placed into the Strategic National Stockpile.“There has never been a confrontation in the task force meetings like the one yesterday,” claimed a source about Navarro’s outburst at Fauci. “People speak up and there’s robust debate, but there’s never been a confrontation. Yesterday was the first confrontation.”When polled about the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine, about 37 percent of some 6227 doctors in 30 countries indicated that it is currently the “most effective therapy” that they have at their disposal. This is compared to at least 14 other potential treatment options that are currently available.A whopping 72 percent of COVID-19 cases in Spain have had hydroxychloroquine prescribed, while almost half of all cases in Italy have had the drug prescribed. Hydroxychloroquine is also being used in about 41 percent of Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) cases in Brazil, 39 percent of cases in Mexico, 28 percent of cases in France, and 23 percent of cases in the United States.Overall, almost 20 percent of physicians are now prescribing hydroxychloroquine for their high-risk patients, while a mere eight percent are prescribing it for their low-risk patients.It’s now clear that Fauci is trying to DEPRIVE America of a coronavirus cure\n",

      "But according to one simulation run less than three months ago, things could get much, much worse. Less than three months ago, Eric Toner, a scientist at the Johns Hopkins Centre for Health Security, had run a simulation of a global pandemic involving the exact same type of virus, according to Business Insider. \n",
      "His simulation predicted that 65 million people could die \"within 18 months\". He commented:“I have thought for a long time that the most likely virus that might cause a new pandemic would be a coronavirus.”As of now, the outbreak is not a pandemic, but it has been reported in eight different countries. Toner's simulation said that nearly \"every country in the world\" would have the virus after six months.He commented:“We don’t yet know how contagious it is. We know that it is being spread person to person, but we don’t know to what extent. An initial first impression is that this is significantly milder than SARS. So that’s reassuring. On the other hand, it may be more transmissible than SARS, at least in the community setting.”His analysis used a fictional virus called CAPS, which would be resistant to any modern vaccine and would be deadlier than SARS. The simulation involved a virus originating in Brazil's pig farms. The outbreak started small, with farmers coming down with symptoms, before spreading to crowded and impoverished areas. The simulation also showed flights being cancelled and travel bookings falling by 45%, as people disseminated false information on social media. It also triggered a financial crisis around the globe, with global GDP falling 11% and stock markets falling 20% to 40%. No word on whether or not the simulation accounted for the modern monetary theory the Fed is essentially governing with now. He also claimed that the current coronavirus could have major economic impact if it the total cases hits the thousands.He concluded:“If we could make it so that we could have a vaccine within months rather than years or decades, that would be a game changer. But it’s not just the identification of potential vaccines. We need to think even more about how they are manufactured on a global scale and distributed and administered to people.”\n",

      "As of Thursday afternoon, 23 million people in seven Chinese cities have been placed on quarantine due to the sudden outbreak of a deadly SARS-like virus called 2019-nCoV.The illness is said to have originated in a seafood market in Wuhan and quickly spread to other areas of China, then Japan, Thailand, South Korea, and the United States. Suspected cases have been reported in Australia and Scotland. However, it is possible that there is more to the story as Chinese authorities have been running a censorship campaign to prevent the spread of information about the virus that deviates from official statements.One very strange coincidence in the development of this outbreak is the fact that a new biolab, tasked with studying the most dangerous pathogens on earth, recently began operating in Wuhan—where the illness is said to have originated.Back in 2017, just before experiments at the lab began, the prestigious science journal Nature published an article expressing concerns about pathogens escaping from the new Wuhan lab. The laboratory is a biosafety level-4 (BSL-4) facility, which is the highest level of biocontainment. BSL-4 facilities must meet rigid standards for decontaminating the area as well as workers after every experiment. However, BSL-4 labs remain extremely controversial because critics argue that these measures may not be enough to prevent a virus from escaping.According to Richard Ebright, a molecular biologist at Rutgers University in Piscataway, New Jersey, the SARS virus has escaped from high-level containment facilities in Beijing multiple times.In May of 2019, less than a year before the outbreak began, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a press release that gave an overview of the projects that the new lab was currently working on. The projects included SARS, Ebola, Hemorrhagic fever, Lassa fever, avian influenza A(H5N1), Rift Valley fever, and others.Scientists have examined the genetic code of the new virus and have found that it is more closely related to SARS than any other human coronavirus. In BSL-4 labs, researchers can tweak or combine deadly viruses to create mutated strains of the original illness. A 2013 report in Nature indicated that scientists in China were creating hybrid viruses in labs.“A team of scientists in China has created hybrid viruses by mixing genes from H5N1 and the H1N1 strain behind the 2009 swine flu pandemic, and showed that some of the hybrids can spread through the air between guinea pigs,” the article revealed.The results of the hybrid virus experiment were published in the journal Science.Such experiments are usually intended to teach scientists more about certain illnesses so they can be treated and prevented better, but other research has involved intentionally making certain viruses even more deadly than they already were. Regardless of the motivation, exposing people to these pathogens, even in the most secure of settings, can be risky especially considering the fact that contagions have escaped from secure labs in the past.Biolab for “Most Dangerous Pathogens on Earth” Opened in Wuhan Before Outbreak\n",

      "We have listened with concern to voices erroneously suggesting that herd immunity may “soon slow the spread” of COVID-19. For example, Rush Limbaugh recently claimed that “herd immunity has occurred in California.” As infectious disease epidemiologists, we wish to state clearly that herd immunity against COVID-19 will not be achieved at a population level in 2020, barring a public health catastrophe.Although more than 2.5 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported worldwide, studies suggest that (as of early April 2020) no more than 2-4%3–5 of any country’s population has been infected with SARS-CoV-2 (the coronavirus that causes COVID-19). Even in hotspots like New York City that have been hit hardest by the pandemic, initial studies suggest that perhaps 15-21%, of people have been exposed so far. In getting to that level of exposure, more than 17500 of the 8.4 million people in New York City (about 1 in every 500 New Yorkers) have died, with the overall death rate in the city suggesting deaths may be undercounted and mortality may be even higher.Some have entertained the idea of “controlled voluntary infection,” akin to the “chickenpox parties” of the 1980s. However, COVID-19 is 100 times more lethal than the chickenpox. For example, on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, the mortality rate among those infected with SARS-CoV-2 was 1%. Someone who goes to a “coronavirus party” to get infected would not only be substantially increasing their own chance of dying in the next month, they would also be putting their families and friends at risk. COVID-19 is now the leading cause of death in the United States, killing almost 2000 Americans every day. Chickenpox never killed more than 150 Americans in a year.To reach herd immunity for COVID-19, likely 70% or more of the population would need to be immune. Without a vaccine, over 200 million Americans would have to get infected before we reach this threshold. Put another way, even if the current pace of the COVID-19 pandemic continues in the United States – with over 25000 confirmed cases a day – it will be well into 2021 before we reach herd immunity. If current daily death rates continue, over half a million Americans would be dead from COVID-19 by that time.As we discuss when and how to phase in re-opening,10 it is important to understand how vulnerable we remain. Increased testing will help us better understand the scope of infection, but it is clear this pandemic is still only beginning to unfold.Early Herd Immunity against COVID-19: A Dangerous Misconception\n",

      "14 people who were confirmed cases of COVID-19 (in Europe), took MMS and have recovered their health. All of these tested positive and when re-tested after taking MMS, they came out negative for COVID-19. Those of us who have used chlorine dioxide (MMS) over the years certainly expected it to also work with this virus, but we wanted to be sure and now with this data we are confident that the proper mixture of chlorine dioxide (MMS) has every hope of eradicating COVID-19.If you have COVID-19: --Take Protocol 6 and 6 to start. This is one 6-drop dose of MMS, then one hour later take another 6-drop dose of MMS. --After two 6-drop doses of MMS, go on hourly doses of 3 activated drops in 4 ounces of water hourly . . . --For children, follow the same instructions as above and cut the amounts in half. Here is the testimony of a man who was experiencing very serious symptoms of Coronavirus: The man is 85 years old and was confirmed to have coronavirus. He was quarantined at home, all of his relatives at home were also infected, but the elderly man was in very serious condition and on oxygen—by far he was the most worst off. He was given a 1 liter bottle of water which had 20 activated drops of MMS added to it. He was instructed to take a sip from the bottle every five minutes, but not to let it go past 10 minutes. So every 5 to 10 minutes the man took a sip (not a big gulp, just a sip) from the bottle—that’s all, but he did this faithfully, every 5 to 10 minutes throughout the day until the bottle was finished, just a sip each time. After three days he was noticeably improved and off of the oxygen, so his dose was reduced to 12 activated drops in the 1 liter bottle of water and he drank from it, just sipping it, every half hour. He is recovering quickly—90% improved, has just a slight remnant of cough occasionally. The rest of the family who also took MMS are now fully recovered.Coronavirus Update (COVID-19)\n",

      "“I will tell you, more and more, we’re hearing the story [that the new coronavirus emerged from a Wuhan lab].” President Trump isn’t the only one hearing this tale. The political world, Internet theorists, intelligence analysts and global public health officials are abuzz with a big question: Is it possible that the new coronavirus — which causes covid-19 — leaked from a lab?For months, Chinese authorities have pointed to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan as the virus’s likely origin. A cluster of early cases had contact with the market. It sold a wide variety of wildlife that, officials hypothesized, was critical to the virus’s formation and spread. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which cause similar symptoms, were formed after a coronavirus from a bat transformed in another animal and then jumped to humans.The logic seems straightforward. But a more complete analysis of early cases suggests that locating the origin of the virus may not be so simple. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that of the first 425 patients, only 45 percent had connections to the market. A separate Jan. 24 analysis published in the Lancet found that three of the first four cases — including the first known case — did not have market links.Daniel R. Lucey, a pandemics expert at Georgetown University, put it simply: “In my opinion, the virus came into the market before it came out of the market.”That tinge of uncertainty was bolstered after Washington Post columnist Josh Rogin revealed two 2018 cables in which State Department officials warned of safety issues at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a laboratory studying bat coronaviruses. Renewed questions about the virus’s origin brought a rush of alternative theories. Some claimed the virus was a bioweapon. Others suggested it had been altered for a scientific experiment or was simply a viral sample that escaped from a lab.Let’s be clear: No scientist we spoke to thinks the new coronavirus was designed as a bioweapon. When asked, Milton Leitenberg, a biological weapons expert at the University of Maryland, responded with a flat “No.”Most experts say the new coronavirus was the product of a natural process. Still, the safety issues described in the 2018 cables, the Chinese government’s response and the proximity of the labs to the market have raised eyebrows.As college professors are fond of saying, the absence of evidence is not the same as the evidence of absence. The Fact Checker video team investigates.The Facts. The Labs. In Wuhan, at least two labs study coronaviruses that originate in bats — the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) and the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention (WHCDC). Both are close to the seafood market. The WIV is about eight miles away. The WHCDC is right around the corner.Despite the overlap in research, what the two labs actually do is quite different. The WIV is home to China’s first laboratory to receive the highest level of international bioresearch safety (known as BSL-4). In addition, it houses lower-level (BSL-3 and BSL-2) labs. The WHCDC is home only to a BSL-2 lab.“BSL-2 is what we normally think of when we think of a lab,” explained Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. It is a lab where “somebody is wearing a lab coat and gloves; they’re at a bench.” (BSL-4 is akin to what is seen in movies such as “Contagion.”She explained that the seemingly relaxed security is because coronaviruses found in bats “don’t infect human cells very well, if at all. So often they’re not considered major potential pathogens because they just don’t grow very well in other species besides bats.” If scientists were being particularly cautious, she explained, they might work in a BSL-3 lab.Researchers from both labs faced criticism in recent years that they have not followed appropriate safety protocols. A video published in December 2019 shows Tian Junhua, a prominent researcher based at the WHCDC, conducting field research on bats without appropriate protective equipment.Warnings from U.S. diplomats in 2018 appeared to refer to the BSL-4 lab at the WIV. They reported: “During interactions with scientists at the WIV laboratory, they noted the new lab has a serious shortage of appropriately trained technicians and investigators needed to safely operate this high-containment laboratory.”\n",
      "But Rasmussen cautioned against putting too much weight on these reports: “Without fail, every single BSL-4 lab in the U.S. gets some type of safety violation, some type of thing that they could do better.”A 2019 paper written by WIV researchers about China’s effort to add more high-level bioresearch labs warned: “The experience of laboratory biosafety personnel training is relatively lacking. … Insufficient training staff and training problems such as uneven standards require urgent improvement.” A separate 2019 paper by Yuan Zhiming, a chief scientist at Wuhan, described systemic deficiencies at high-security labs: “Maintenance cost is generally neglected; several high-level BSLs have insufficient operating funds for routine, yet vital processes.” Most laboratories “lack specialized biosafety managers and engineers,” he wrote.Months after the new coronavirus was discovered, the Global Times, a state-run newspaper, published an article outlining new government guidelines aimed at fixing “chronic management loopholes at virus labs.” The article noted that some labs have paid “insufficient attention to biological disposal.”Could a safety lapse have opened the door for the new coronavirus to escape one of these labs, just as SARS had? (To be clear, SARS escaped after it had been identified. The initial outbreak did not begin this way.) Accidents happen. Records reveal multiple accidents have led to the escape of dangerous pathogens and inadvertent infections at U.S. laboratories.While no comparable records exist in China, one of the world’s foremost experts on these viruses, Shi Zhengli, based at the WIV, thought it was possible. In March, Shi told the Scientific American that in the early days of the outbreak, even she wondered whether coronaviruses were to blame. “Could they have come from our lab?” After all, her lab had collected and sequenced tens of thousands of coronaviruses over the past decade. (She has since adamantly denied that the new coronavirus could have emerged from her lab. Her boss and the WIV issued similar denials.The Virus.Safety protocols aren’t a virus’s only barrier between a life in a test tube and one infecting millions. The virus would need to be able to infect humans (or another animal that can then infect humans), and that infection needs to be strong enough that it isn’t immediately beaten by the immune system, allowing it to spread among people.Most known bat coronaviruses cannot do either of these things. The novel coronavirus, however, can do both. That said, it is called “novel” for a reason: It had never before appeared in scientific research.Viruses — like people — have distinct genetic sequences that give scientists clues to their origin. Research published in the journal Nature on Feb. 3 found that this virus falls within a family of known coronaviruses that come from bats. It shares nearly 80 percent of the genome as the original SARS-CoV and 96 percent of the genome of a virus (RaTG13) that Shi’s team had previously sampled.While 96 percent may sound like a big overlap to nonscientists, the 4 percent difference is found in the part of the virus that binds to human cells. Without that adaptation, Lucey, the Georgetown professor, put it simply: “It’s interesting, but it’s not going to cause any outbreaks in people.”Moreover, the two viruses are generations apart. Edward Holmes, an evolutionary virologist from the University of Sydney who has written about the origin of the new virus, explained via email that the two viruses “shared a common ancestor that lived a long time ago. What this means is that [the new coronavirus] is NOT derived from RaTG13.” Holmes noted another virus that — like RaTG13 — was sampled 1000 miles from Wuhan in a cave in Yunnan is a closer relative to the new virus, but “not close enough to be the direct ancestor.” And critically, he said, this other virus, “is not from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, nor from anywhere else in Wuhan.”So how did this virus end up 1000 miles from the nearest known relative? There are any number of potential explanations. A wildlife trafficker might have brought an infected bat into the city. Another animal might have picked up the virus from bats years ago, allowing it to transform in just the right way to infect humans. There are thousands of bat viruses that scientists have not sampled and even more coronaviruses that circulate in other species, so there’s no guarantee it actually came from thousands of miles away.But even if that virus from Shi’s lab is not the source for the virus, her lab is full of bat coronavirus variants. That left us wondering: Could this virus have been the accidental product of an experiment gone awry? A 2015 paper cautioned against the “gain of function” experiments with which Shi’s team was involved. In this kind of experiment, the researchers mutate a virus strain to enhance a pathogen’s natural traits. Even though the most dangerous part of that experiment was not conducted at the WIV, the 2018 State Department cables referenced similar research by Shi and her team.In 2017, Shi and her team published a study revealing that they had found a coronavirus from a bat that could be transmitted directly to humans. After reviewing the study, Rasmussen said via email that just because these viruses could attach to human cells, it “does not show that they are particularly effective at doing so.” Binding is only one part of the process. “It is not the sole determinant of viral fitness (the ability of the virus to replicate robustly in a given host) or pathogenicity (the ability of the virus to cause disease).” Moreover, genomic analysis reveals that none of the virus samples used to conduct these experiments were or could have been transformed to be the new coronavirus that causes covid-19.That, however, is just one study. Shi’s lab published dozens of academic papers researching bat coronaviruses. The Washington Post reviewed academic studies that described “scores of encounters with animals that are known hosts to deadly viruses, including strains closely related to the pathogen behind the covid-19 outbreak.”“While the scientists wore gloves and masks and took other protective measures, U.S. experts who reviewed the experiments say the precautions would not necessarily protect the researchers from harmful exposures, in caves or in the lab,” The Post reported.This kind of research filled in critical gaps in scientific understanding of SARS-like coronaviruses. It also increased the risk of accidental exposure and lab accidents. But many scientists are still dubious.Kristian G. Andersen, an immunology and microbiology professor at Scripps Research, alongside Holmes and other researchers, stated firmly, “Our analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus.” Trevor Bedford, a researcher in computational biology and infectious diseases at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, was more specific. “You don’t see kind of large chunks of genomic material that are somehow inserted or absent,” he said. Rather, it is the opposite. “The differences are these small mutations, as you’d expect from nature.”(Shi did not return our emails. None of her current collaborators we spoke to could precisely speak to her current research.) Still, no scientist was willing to completely dismiss the idea — they only said that it was highly unlikely. After all, we neither know what either lab was specifically working on, nor do we have an archive of every animal in the lab and virus sequence in its freezer. Without identifying the earliest case and the evolution of the virus, everything is a hypothesis.Richard H. Ebright, a microbiologist and biosafety expert at Rutgers University, said: “The question whether the outbreak virus entered humans through an accidental infection of a lab worker is a question of historical fact, not a question of scientific fact. The question can be answered only through a forensic investigation, not through a scientific investigation.”The Chinese Response. The actions of Chinese officials have done little to quash suspicion of a lab leak. Before the government had even alerted the World Health Organization to the growing epidemic, scientists were told to destroy early samples of the virus, according to the Straits Times.Then, in an unusual move for the government, officials quickly pinned the outbreak on the market. But they have done little to provide supporting evidence for this theory. Officials reported that 33 of 585 environmental samples from the market contained the new coronavirus. Thirty-one of the positive samples were located in the area of the market known to sell wildlife. But where exactly these samples were taken is not clear. They could just as well have been taken from animal cages or a bathroom. Moreover, China has not divulged the results of any tests done on any animals that were recovered from the market before it was cleaned.\n",
      "Several doctors, journalists and researchers based in China appear to have suddenly gone quiet over this issue. The New York Times reported by mid-January — shortly after the sequence of the virus was made public — that “Chinese scientists cut off official communications” with their American counterparts.On Feb. 6, Botao Xiao, a molecular biomechanics researcher at South China University of Technology, published a paper arguing that “the killer coronavirus probably originated from a laboratory in Wuhan.” He pointed to the previous safety mishaps and the kind of research both labs undertake as evidence. After the paper gained international attention, Chinese authorities flatly denied that an accident happened. Xiao later withdrew the paper, explaining in a brief email to the Wall Street Journal on Feb. 26: “The speculation about the possible origins in the post was based on published papers and media, and was not supported by direct proofs.”The Chinese government’s actions have inhibited the scientific community’s ability to trace the origin of the virus and serve to only raise suspicions.\n",
      "“It just seems like such a remarkable coincidence that you have an outbreak of a coronavirus in theory from a bat in the same city where there is this high-level BSL-4 laboratory, where not only are there foreign concerns about its safety, but there are Chinese articles about the safety protocols not being sufficient. And obviously there’s no smoking gun,” said Emily de La Bruyère, a China expert with Horizon Advisory. “It’s all circumstantial, but it’s pretty remarkable.”\n",
      "In a statement via email, the Chinese Embassy in Washington told The Fact Checker: “The source of the virus is a serious and complex matter of science that must be studied by scientists and medical experts. Many scientists have already pointed out that COVID-19 has a natural origin.”But the U.S. government is not convinced. The intelligence community “will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan,” the director of national intelligence said in a statement on April 30.The Bottom Line. The balance of the scientific evidence strongly supports the conclusion that the new coronavirus emerged from nature — be it the Wuhan market or somewhere else. Too many unexpected coincidences would have had to take place for it to have escaped from a lab. But the Chinese government has not been willing or able to provide information that would clarify lingering questions about any possible role played by either Wuhan lab.That’s why intelligence agencies are still exploring that possibility, no matter how remote it may be. And even then, it’s unclear when or if we will ever know the origin story of this new virus that is causing death and economic turmoil around the globe.Was the new coronavirus accidentally released from a Wuhan lab?

      "Let’s be clear, although there have been many attempts to do so by scientists worldwide, so far, no one knows the origin of CoVid-19, the coronavirus strain responsible for the global pandemic.CoVid-19 has several unique features such as high-affinity human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor binding, a furin (polybasic) cleavage site and certain “open reading frame” derived proteins, all of which come together in a single organism to create an extremely contagious and often deadly virus.CoVid-19 is the seventh member of the family of coronaviruses that infect humans. Although the SARS-CoV coronavirus, responsible for the 2002-2003 pandemic, also binds to the human ACE2 receptor, none of the previously-identified human-infecting coronavirus strains is sufficiently similar to CoVid-19 to be designated its immediate relative or “progenitor.”Of the comparisons made between CoVid-19 and all of the other potential progenitors, including those identified in an article much-cited by the main stream media, none possess the furin (polybasic) cleavage site, which potentially makes it a marker in the search for the origin of CoVid-19, if other structural similarities are also present.Much like the climate change debate, there appears to be a politically-motivated campaign to demonstrate that CoVid-19 occurred naturally as a species “jump” from animals to humans originating in the Wuhan wet market. Despite an extraordinary effort, mainly by the Chinese government, and a flood of publications, there is still little evidence that directly supports that contention.An alternative interpretation is that CoVid-19 “leaked” out of a Wuhan laboratory, either as a yet undescribed or not fully sequenced natural coronavirus isolate e.g. bat coronavirus BtCoV/4991 (GenBank KP876546) or as one manufactured by combining the properties of multiple viruses and subjected to a sequential passage of the recombinant through live animal hosts.It is important to note that deadly viruses have previously \"leaked\" out of Chinese virology labs in two separate incidents.A 2004  outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) in China involved two researchers who were working with the virus in a Beijing research lab, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on April 26, 2004 and confirmed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.Synthetic biology, that is, the engineering of biology to create biologically-based systems that do not exist in nature is now widely used in laboratories worldwide. It has a number of benefits including as a rapid response platform to provide treatments for emerging diseases.If unregulated, however, such bioengineering can produce combined or “chimeric” novel human pathogenic microorganisms capable of circumventing therapeutics or vaccines and, if released in nature, could have dramatic and permanent effects on disease transmission among species via natural-occurring mutations of the new viral entity.The technology to create a coronavirus chimera has been demonstrated.In a 2015 collaborative study between the Wuhan Institute of Virology and American scientists, funded by the National Institutes of Health, properties of two different viruses, the SHC014-CoV coronavirus and a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV, the coronavirus responsible for the 2002 pandemic, were combined as a chimera. It produced a new viral entity, SHC014-MA15, which, according to the authors, \"Despite predictions from both structure-based modeling and pseudotyping experiments\" unexpectedly \"was viable and replicated to high titers\" [a lot] in cell culture (Vero cells) and was capable of infecting human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures [human lung surface cells] and \"showed robust replication\" comparable to the \"epidemic SARS-CoV Urbani strain.\"That is, with the appropriate starting coronavirus strains, it is theoretically possible to manufacture a CoVid-19-like chimera.Given the illness, death and economic destruction caused by CoVid-19, it is the responsibility of the Chinese government to fully open its research files and databases to international inspection, including information about the hundreds of coronavirus isolates, in order to ascertain the true origin of the Chinese CoVid-19 coronavirus.US Army Colonel (Ret.): \"Yes, The COVID-19 Pandemic Could Have Originated In A Chinese Lab...\"\n",

      "But just last year, the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the organization led by Dr. Fauci, funded scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and other institutions for working on gain-of-function research on bat coronaviruses.In 2019, with the backing of NIAID, the National Institutes of Health committed $3.7 million over six years for research that included some gain-of-function work. The program followed another $3.7 million, 5- year project for collecting and studying bat coronaviruses, which ended in 2019, bringing the total to $7.4 million. Many scientists have criticized the gain of function research, which involves manipulating viruses in the lab to explore their potential for infecting humans because it creates a risk of starting a pandemic from accidental release.The NIH research consisted of two parts. The first part began in 2014 and involved surveillance of bat coronaviruses, and had a budget of $3.7 million. The program funded Shi Zheng-Li, a virologist at the Wuhan lab, and other researchers to investigate and catalog bat coronaviruses in the wild. This part of the project was completed in 2019.A second phase of the project, beginning that year, included additional surveillance work but also gain-of-function research for the purpose of understanding how bat coronaviruses could mutate to attack humans. NIH canceled the project just this past Friday, April 24th.A decade ago, during a controversy over gain-of-function research on bird-flu viruses, Dr. Fauci played an important role in promoting the work. He argued that the research was worth the risk it entailed because it enables scientists to make preparations, such as investigating possible anti-viral medications, that could be useful if and when a pandemic occurred. The work in question was a type of gain-of-function research that involved taking wild viruses and passing them through live animals until they mutate into a form that could pose a pandemic threat.The work entailed risks that worried even seasoned researchers. More than 200 scientists called for the work to be halted. The problem, they said, is that it increased the likelihood that a pandemic would occur through a laboratory accident. in 2014, under pressure from the Obama administration, the National of Institutes of Health instituted a moratorium on the work, suspending 21 studies. Three years later, though—in December 2017—the NIH ended the moratorium and the second phase of the NIAID project, which included the gain-of-function research, began. dr fauci caught sponsoring wuhan lab millions\n",

      "About 56 million people in several Chinese cities have been placed on quarantine due to the sudden outbreak of a deadly SARS-like virus called 2019-nCoV. The illness is said to have originated in a seafood market in Wuhan and quickly spread to other areas of China, then Japan, Thailand, South Korea, and the United States. Suspected cases have been reported in Australia and Scotland. However, it is possible that there is more to the story as Chinese authorities have been running a censorship campaign to prevent the spread of information about the virus that deviates from official statements.One very strange coincidence in the development of this outbreak is the fact that a new biolab, tasked with studying the most dangerous pathogens on earth, recently began operating in Wuhan, where the illness is said to have originated.Back in 2017, just before experiments at the lab began, the prestigious science journal Nature published an article expressing concerns about pathogens escaping from the new Wuhan lab. The laboratory is a biosafety level-4 (BSL-4) facility, which is the highest level of biocontainment. BSL-4 facilities must meet rigid standards for decontaminating the area as well as workers after every experiment. However, BSL-4 labs remain extremely controversial because critics argue that these measures may not be enough to prevent a virus from escaping. According to Richard Ebright, a molecular biologist at Rutgers University in Piscataway, New Jersey, the SARS virus has escaped from high-level containment facilities in Beijing multiple times.In May of 2019, less than a year before the outbreak began, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a press release that gave an overview of the projects that the new lab was currently working on. The projects included SARS, Ebola, Hemorrhagic fever, Lassa fever, avian influenza A(H5N1), Rift Valley fever, and others. Scientists have examined the genetic code of the new virus and have found that it is more closely related to SARS than any other human coronavirus. In BSL-4 labs, researchers can tweak or combine deadly viruses to create mutated strains of the original illness. A 2013 report in Nature indicated that scientists in China were creating hybrid viruses in labs.“A team of scientists in China has created hybrid viruses by mixing genes from H5N1 and the H1N1 strain behind the 2009 swine flu pandemic, and showed that some of the hybrids can spread through the air between guinea pigs,” the article revealed.The results of the hybrid virus experiment were published in the journal Science.Such experiments are usually intended to teach scientists more about certain illnesses so they can be treated and prevented better, but other research has involved intentionally making certain viruses even more deadly than they already were. Regardless of the motivation, exposing people to these pathogens, even in the most secure of settings, can be risky especially considering the fact that contagions have escaped from secure labs in the past.Biolab for “Most Dangerous Pathogens on Earth” Opened in Wuhan Before Outbreak\n",

      "Back in 2014 during the Ebola scare in the US I published an article warning about how a global pandemic could be used by the elites as cover for the implementation of an economic collapse as well as martial law measures in western nations. My immediate concern was the way in which a viral outbreak could be engineered or exploited as a rationale for a level of social control that the public would never accept under normal circumstances. And this could be ANY viral outbreak, not just Ebola. The point is the creation of an “invisible enemy” that the populace cannot quantify and defend itself against without constant government oversight.I noted specifically how the government refused to apply air travel restrictions in 2014 to nations where the outbreak had taken hold when they could have stopped the spread in its tracks. This is something that was done again in 2020 as the UN’s WHO and governments including our government in the US refused to stop air travel from China, pretending as if it was not a hot zone and that the virus was nothing to worry about.This attitude of nonchalance serves a purpose. The establishment NEEDS the pandemic to spread, because then they have a rationale for strict controls of pubic activities and movements. This is the end goal. They have no care whatsoever for public health or safety. The end game is to acquire power, not save lives.  In fact, they might prefer a higher death count in the beginning as this would motivate the public to beg for more restrictions in the name of security.\n",
      "Authorities went from downplaying the outbreak and telling people not to bother with preparations like purchasing N95 masks, to full blown crisis mode only weeks later. In January Trump initially claimed he “trusted” the data out of China and said that “everything was under control”; as usual only a couple months down the road and Trump flip-flopped on both assertions.  The World Health Organization refused to even label this outbreak a “pandemic” until the virus was entrenched across the globe.  The question people will ask is, was this all due to incompetence, or was it social engineering?The Ebola event six years ago seems to have been a dry run for what is happening today.  I believe it is entirely deliberate, and I will explain why in this article, but either way, governments have proven they cannot be trusted to handle the pandemic crisis, nor can they be trusted to protect the people and their freedoms.\n",
      "At the same time, the pandemic itself is tightly intertwined with economic collapse. The two events feed off one another. The pandemic provides perfect cover for the crash of the massive debt bubble central banks and international banks have created over the years. I noted in February that the global economy was crashing long before the coronavirus ever showed up.  At the same time, economic chaos increases 3rd world conditions within each country, which means poor nutrition and health care options that cause more sickness and more deaths from the virus. As outlined in 2014:“Who would question the event of an economic collapse in the wake of an Ebola (virus) soaked nightmare? Who would want to buy or sell? Who would want to come in contact with strangers to generate a transaction? Who would even leave their house? Ebola (viral) treatment in first world nations has advantages of finance and a cleaner overall health environment, but what if economic downturn happens simultaneously? America could experience third world status very quickly, and with it, all the unsanitary conditions that result in an exponential Ebola (pandemic) death rate. Amidst even a moderate or controlled viral scenario, stocks and bonds will undoubtedly crash, a crash that was going to happen anyway. The international banks who created the mess get off blameless, while Ebola (viral outbreak), an act of nature, becomes the ultimate scapegoat for every disaster that follows.”As the double threat of financial collapse and viral pandemic accelerate, fear becomes widespread for those that never prepared ahead of time (and we’re talking about millions of people).  When people are afraid they tend to sacrifice their freedoms to anyone that offers them a promise of safety, no matter how empty. For now, the public is being convinced to assume that lockdowns and restrictions are temporary, but this is a lie. The elites must maintain and increase restrictions with each passing month in order to prevent rebellion until they are ready to implement martial law measures.You see, the establishment is going for broke with this event, and because of this there is the potential for them to face dire consequences. The facade is quickly evaporating; the collectivists and globalists are risking exposure of themselves and their political puppets in order to build a totalitarian system with extreme speed. The establishment must keep the pressure on for now, because if the public is allowed to breath for just a moment they might look around and wake up to the bigger agenda. The public has to be forced to beg for aid from the authorities; only then will the pressure be lifted for a short time. The public has to believe the control grid was THEIR idea.A new process of mass conditioning is about to be set in motion, using “waves” of panic and then waves of release and calm. After studying the behavioral traits and methods of narcissistic sociopaths (psychopaths) for many years, I can tell you this form of conditioning is very familiar. This is exactly what they always do, just on a global scale – They create an atmosphere of crisis to keep people around them unbalanced and on edge, then “relieve the pressure” intermittently so that those same people relax and their anger is deflated for a time. Then, the process starts all over again. This conditioning traps the narcopath’s victims in a constant state of flux and uncertainty, and the moments of calm become a placebo which prevent their rebellion against him. He can then feed off his victims at his leisure like a psychological vampire, and often these victims will see the narcopath as their only means of support. They have been convinced that all the threats are coming from the outside; they do not realize the source of the threats is the person standing right next to them.The wave model of conditioning and control is starting to show up everywhere, and it is most blatant in the intended “solution” presented by establishment elites in response to the coronavirus outbreak. As Truthstream Media outlined in their excellent video ‘We Are Living In 12 Monkeys’, MIT recently published a paper written by their globalist editor in chief Gideon Lichfield titled ‘We’re Not Going Back To Normal’ which admits quite brazenly how the elites intend to use this crisis to their advantage.Lichfield lays out a kind of programming schedule for the population based on waves of viral infection outbreaks, waves of tight social restrictions, followed by waves of limited economic activity and limited calm over the next 18 months. As Lichfield suggests:“To stop coronavirus we will need to radically change almost everything we do: how we work, exercise, socialize, shop, manage our health, educate our kids, take care of family members.We all want things to go back to normal quickly. But what most of us have probably not yet realized—yet will soon—is that things won’t go back to normal after a few weeks, or even a few months. Some things never will.”He continues:“As long as someone in the world has the virus, breakouts can and will keep recurring without stringent controls to contain them. In a report yesterday researchers at Imperial College London proposed a way of doing this: impose more extreme social distancing measures every time admissions to intensive care units (ICUs) start to spike, and relax them each time admissions fall. Understand that there are 7 billion people on the planet, and this process of control could go on for years while we wait for every person to overcome the virus or die from it.  The only way for the public to escape this purgatory (according to Lichfield) is for them to submit to a biometric data grid. They must volunteer (or be forced) to participate in 24/7 tracking through their cell phones and through mass surveillance. In order to function in society, an individual must have the proper digital marker which tells the authorities that they are “clean” and devoid of infection.  The system is being used in China right now:This system achieves a number of things. Much like the social credit system China has been using for the past few years, the public is compelled to constantly appease the hidden but all seeing eye of government. Everything they do is watched by algorithms and surveillance. Any deviation might trigger scrutiny and a loss of simple freedoms to move around or participate in normal human interaction. Lichfield argues:“Ultimately, however, I predict that we’ll restore the ability to socialize safely by developing more sophisticated ways to identify who is a disease risk and who isn’t, and discriminating—legally—against those who are.one can imagine a world in which, to get on a flight, perhaps you’ll have to be signed up to a service that tracks your movements via your phone. The airline wouldn’t be able to see where you’d gone, but it would get an alert if you’d been close to known infected people or disease hot spots. There’d be similar requirements at the entrance to large venues, government buildings, or public transport hubs. There would be temperature scanners everywhere, and your workplace might demand you wear a monitor that tracks your temperature or other vital signs. Where nightclubs ask for proof of age, in future they might ask for proof of immunity—an identity card or some kind of digital verification via your phone, showing you’ve already recovered from or been vaccinated against the latest virus strains.”And there you have it. The social and biometric control grid that globalists have been hungry to set up for years now has the perfect catalyst – a viral pandemic which could cycle indefinitely; all that would be needed is to release a designer virus every couple years which renews public fear. The populace becomes increasingly dependent on government for everything as their very survival depends on their ability to function within the new economy, and without a special mark granted by government saying you are not an infection risk, you could be shunned from all trade and participation.Refuse to get vaccinated due to health concerns?  You’re kicked out of the economy.  Homeschool your children?  They have not been monitored and are therefore an infection risk, and your whole family is kicked out of the economy.  Hold political views that are contrary to globalism?  Maybe you are listed as a danger to the system and wrongly labeled infected as punishment; and then you are kicked out of the economy.  The establishment can use the threat of economic removal to condition many people into complacency or slavery.The MIT editor goes on to drive his point home in rather arrogant fashion:“We’ll adapt to and accept such measures, much as we’ve adapted to increasingly stringent airport security screenings in the wake of terrorist attacks. The intrusive surveillance will be considered a small price to pay for the basic freedom to be with other people.”Beyond the effort to turn “social distancing” into a new cultural norm enforced by law, there is another agenda being quietly instituted – the cashless society. More and more businesses are starting to refuse cash payments, claiming that paper cash spreads the virus.  Oddly enough, they still accept debit cards using pin pads which are much more likely than cash to spread disease.This may force the public to keep their money in banks despite the threat of a credit freeze or bank holiday. What if you pull cash out of your accounts but are not able to spend it anywhere? Eventually, they will ban debit and credit card transactions in stores as well, and replace them with a non-interactive payment model. This will probably be done through your cell phone in the beginning using a scanning app. In the end, they will use your biometric data for all money transactions.\n",
      "This forces the public, yet again, to carry a cell phone on them everywhere for their very survival. The tracking network for the virus as well as the new payment transaction system makes this device indispensable. If you want to participate in society, you will have no choice but to be tracked and traced at all times.\n",
      "Unless, of course, you build your own system of trade and interaction.The solution to medical tyranny and the cashless society is to not need the system at all for your own survival. This means people will have to build their own economies based on barter and local scrip. They will have to dump their cell phones and rely on other forms of communication such as radio, or establish a digital communication system separate and independent from the establishment system. They will have to become producers and achieve more self reliance. They will have to break free from the grid, and this has to start RIGHT NOW.Of course, the establishment will claim that these independent people are a threat to everyone else simply by existing.  They will perpetuate the lie of “herd immunity” and will claim that independent people will “spread the virus”, even to those who are supposedly protected through vaccination. And eventually they will try to stop decoupled and localized communities from existing using force. At that point we simply go to war with the elites, as we were always going to have to do anyway. The alternative is slavery in the name of the “greater good”, but there is no greater good without freedom, and there is no society without individuality.

      "This brave and intelligent respiratory doctor has blown the whistle on the fake pandemic that is COVID-19. He joins the ranks of a growing number of doctors on the frontlines who are reporting that this so-called pandemic simply doesn’t add up, due to various reasons that have been reported by independent and citizen journalists: empty hospitals, inflated figures and people being falsely counted as COVID-19 cases.This respiratory doctor also exposes the COVID-19 test itself as useless. It is not testing for the virus but rather the reaction to the virus. Since it is a PCR test and not the gold standard of isolation and purification etc. (Koch’s postulates discussed here), it is merely testing for RNA sequences that could be caused by many other things, not a dreaded new coronavirus strain.The PCR test is limited in function and flawed if used for broad diagnosis; it uses cycles to amplify the RNA sequence, which leads to many people getting a “positive” that in reality could be from cancer, radiation or many other things. He also had some scathing things to say about his fellow doctors just going along with the program and not asking the tough questions, a sad reflection on the profession, since it is well-known people look up to doctors and give away their power to perceived authority.“Good evening YouTube. This is our future and the power’s with the people. Just wanted to let you know I am a respiratory therapist and I’ve been doing this for 21 years. I’ve been kind of all over the place doing this. I wanted to show you our equipment room here. So we want to talk about COVID-19 for a few minutes and the first thing I want to say is: does it look like there’s a ventilator shortage? There’s not, okay! As a matter of fact, we’re running less ventilators right now than we would normally run and that’s cause people are just staying home. They’re not having elective surgeries. I want to talk about the numbers and the criteria that goes into what a COVID patient is or a patient under investigation (what’s also called a PUI). Basically right now, and the way it has been last couple of months when they locked us down, is that any patient that came in with a respiratory problem was labeled COVID. Now that doesn’t matter if it’s you got stage 4 lung cancer, pancreatitis, heart disease, liver failure and everything else – you’re still, because you come in with breathing problems, you’re labeled a COVID patient.Now we have one lady that could do the testing at first that would go … those tests went to the CDC. Only one person was qualified to to test that for the whole place. So several of these patients under investigations were never tested and maybe they died or whatever. Then they would die of COVID and not of stage 4 lung cancer or these things. This is clear that this is what’s come out every single patient that needs one of our pieces of equipment here … any of this if they need any of this stuff, okay, then they are a rule-out COVID. And these tests have taken as long as 2 or 3 weeks to get back. We’re finally getting what they claim; they’ve been claiming this for a month but we’re finally getting in-house testing that’s going to change the game. I think that’s that’s what’s going on in most places and what that also means is isn’t it now you’re going see the numbers either go up or go down, and I would suspect we’re gonna see them spike up, and then spike down real quick, and this is the reason for the number of deaths. So you have to recognize that if every single patient is under COVID investigation and dies, then that goes into a COVID death, and they’re showing the numbers like a football game to scare you. They’re showing you loading bodies into a tractor trailer to scare you. I’ve never in my career ever seen bodies loaded into a tractor trailer. It just doesn’t happen. I wonder if those were even bodies. I really don’t believe it! All of this stuff is fake, okay?Look at our ventilators. Let’s talk about ventilators and why there would be a shortage of ventilators. Well this is non-invasive ventilation here. CPAP or BiPAP: this is a mask that gets strapped on in we can help you breathe with that. We’re not allowed to use those okay? We’re finally opening up to where we can use them a little bit but for the most part since COVID came out they said absolutely not; that’s going to cause the virus to spread all over the place by spraying air slaws everywhere and so we can’t use it you have to let the patient crash and go straight to a ventilator, okay? Traditionally that’s not the way we would treat a patient. We also have air slides medications (bronchodilators) – we’re not allowed to use those either. So everything that we would traditionally do we’re not allowed to do. Every patient that comes in no matter what their history is labeled a COVID under investigation, so if that patient dies that becomes a COVID death, okay?\n",
      "Are Ventilators Killing More People Than They’re Saving??So, there’s a lot of weird things going on when it comes to the testing itself. I’ve been looking at this for about a month now but you can also look for yourself. They were open about it on CBS News the other night. They’re not testing for a virus, like if you go to you get sick you go to the hospital; traditionally you get tested for flu A and B.  Flu A by the way is H1N1 (the one that killed everybody in 2008). They’ll test you for RSV. Those are actual viruses that, you know, they will test you for. This COVID test is different. They’re testing for an RNA sequence from a reaction to the virus. Look this up! Please look it up! They’re not testing for a virus! There’s not one test to test for a virus okay? Then they put it in a PCR. It’s a PCR test which means it amplifies it so if there’s any little one little shred of that RNA sequence from a damaged cell in your lungs or in your nasal passage, you’re going to test positive. Now that can come from cancer, that can come from radiation, that can come from several things, so … and then you hear all this talk on the news about antibody therapy and all of us are kind of stuff people want to donate plasma everything else, but they’re not talking about the virus itself. They’re not testing for the virus itself, and that’s a big big issue, because that makes you say: “Well, is this as infectious as they’re telling us it is?” because if it was as infectious as they’re telling us that it is, these would all be in use and everybody would be dying and we’re not seeing that, okay? This is unbelievable – every bit of this has been created, okay?If you cannot use the non-invasive ventilation and have to go straight to this the ventilator that creates a ventilator shortage but you also want to ask why it’s Ford and GM in the business of making ventilators when we have plenty of companies that already make ventilator you know what kind of ventilator is it? What does it do who’s going to train us on those ventilators and you know how is it going to be tested and then what is the cost per ventilator that the United States is paying for it in GM for these these products that really aren’t obviously needed so all this talk you hear on the news by the governors and everybody else we’re having shortages of ventilators it’s not true it’s not true, okay? So how about health care workers. Yeah we’re getting one or two healthcare workers or coming up positive and you know that would be expected but I would actually expect a lot more healthcare workers to get sick and come up positive and we’ve had some extreme contamination issues from patients that didn’t show any symptoms what and a patient under investigation and then all of a sudden came up positive and none of those health care workers came up positive got sick carried a fever or anything else just to show you real quick here’s my PPE that I have to wear sorry here’s my PPE that I have to wear. This an N95 mask in here and a face shield and of course we got some gowns and stuff but we’re going wearing this or 5 shifts minimum before we can get a new one all right so I’m contaminating myself every time I put this N95 masking the shield in this bag it’s contaminated. it’s contaminating over and over and over again and then I’m putting the mask on, okay? I’m still here I’m not sick and nobody else is either except with the exception of one or two.If you look at the areas that these people are in where the hot spots are like such in Georgia, Albany and Atlanta you really have to say well why are all these places happening in these condensed areas? Well I truly believe this is something else that’s causing this all these patients have comorbidities they’re all older the ones that are you know in life-threatening situations and and the mortality rate is really not that low so if you actually look at what’s going on compared to H1N1 … H1N1 was a million times more scary than the COVID 19 hen it comes to a vaccination you cannot vaccinate yourself really for a sinus infection it’s just not going to work. You can’t vaccinate yourself for every little human ailment that there is you know people are going to get sick. What traditionally happens with viruses such as this if this is a virus and I’m not so sure it is but you’re going to have a real spike such as in SARS Zika H1N1. You gotta have a spike and then it’s going to lose its its efficacy and it’s going to drop and and the mortality rates going to drop I mean the people that get really sick is going to drop you know so you have this initial little bang and then it drops off that’s what a fire wrist normally does I’m not completely convinced this is a virus. I’ve been doing this a long time. Do your own homework do your research but the equipment should speak for itself – does this warrant shutting down the country? Does this warrant $6 to $10 trillion in economic stimulus just for this country? Does this warrant all these things that are being put in place? I mean does this warrant the trillions lost? Does this warrant locking everything up? Beaches, you know, hiking trails, tennis courts, bars, restaurants, pool halls, arm, schools … Does this warrant this? yeah I really don’t think it does – not even close.So y’all need to be asking some some really hard questions here and questioning your government and questioning and people in charge and also questioning your doctors because the doctors believe this stuff just as much as everybody else does but they’re not looking at the real information all they’re doing is they’re told something and hey guess what they got lives they got jobs they got everything else you got. Plus on they don’t care I mean they do care but they’re not gonna go look it up they’re not gonna look up exactly what this test is they’re not gonna look up that hey why aren’t we getting these in fact you know they look up the little things that they’re told look up and that’s it just like anybody else would okay so you know these questions really have to be asked and then for the Trump supporters out there I’m gonna ask you something think about this for a minute we’re doing the same thing they’re doing in France we’re doing the same thing they’re doing in Italy we’re doing the same thing they’re doing any UK so does that mean Trump’s really in charge of this whole thing because I really don’t think he is I think he’s being told to do what he’s doing and and and that’s the way it is I mean this is a deep state Illuminati stuff and this is the real deal and they’re shutting the world down okay y’all people really need to understand this the world okay and they’re putting our kids and grandkids and severe debt – that will never be paid off and if you think of how many taxes you’re paying now can you imagine what our children and our grandchildren are gonna have to pay for this scam so please look up do your homework ask questions look at our equipment room ask why can’t we use this if we’re not seeing the infections yeah you know why can’t we use this non-invasive equipment why are we having auto manufacturers make ventilators. Who’s testing the ventilators? What kind of ventilator price per ventilator all these things the economic stimulus package you know is this gonna be another corporate bailout where they you know give themselves million-dollar bonuses while we starve I bet you it will be so this is real dangerous time we’re coming in – when it comes to the vaccinations I promise you.”Fake Tests, Fake Bodies, Fake Pandemic: All to Keep People in Fear. As this respiratory doctor reveals, there are so many levels of fakery going on with this scamdemic. We have now entered the Brave New World of COVID-1984. We are in a new War on Bioterror, where everyone is a suspected or asymptomatic carrier, and the PCR test can replace the judge to prove your innocence or guilt. There are truly dangerous and unprecedented times. It is vitally important for everyone to not only question government but also to question their doctors so enough people.Share this information. Knowledge dispels fear. Once enough people climb out of fear, naturally they will begin to unite and rise up in anger to demand freedom. Self-respect will kick in. The NWO manipulators who orchestrated this entire event will have a much harder time rolling out their plans when a united and aware citizenry protest en masse and refuse to buy into the fear and refuse to tolerate any more lockdown, house arrest or quarantine.Video: Respiratory Doctor Exposes the Fake Virus Pandemic\n",

      "Humanity is imprisoned by a killer pandemic. People are being arrested for surfing in the ocean and meditating in nature. Nations are collapsing. Hungry citizens are rioting for food. The media has generated so much confusion and fear that people are begging for salvation in a syringe. Billionaire patent owners are pushing for globally mandated vaccines. Anyone who refuses to be injected with experimental poisons will be prohibited from travel, education and work. No, this is not a synopsis for a new horror movie. This is our current reality.Let’s back up to address how we got here.In the early 1900s, America’s first Billionaire, John D. Rockefeller bought a German pharmaceutical company that would later assist Hitler to implement his eugenics-based vision by manufacturing chemicals and poisons for war. Rockefeller wanted to eliminate the competitors of Western medicine, so he submitted a report to Congress declaring that there were too many doctors and medical schools in America, and that all natural healing modalities were unscientific quackery. Rockefeller called for the standardization of medical education, whereby only his organization be allowed to grant medical school licenses in the US. And so began the practice of immune suppressive, synthetic and toxic drugs. Once people had become dependent on this new system and the addictive drugs it provided, the system switched to a paid program, creating lifelong customers for the Rockefellers. Currently, medical error is the third leading cause of death in the US. Rockefeller’s secret weapon to success was the strategy known as, “problem-reaction-solution.” Create a problem, escalate fear, then offer a pre-planned solution. Sound familiar?Flash forward to 2020. They named it COVID19. Our leaders of world health predicted millions would die. The National Guard was deployed. Makeshift hospitals were erected to care for a massive overflow of patients. Mass graves were dug. Terrifying news reports had people everywhere seeking shelter to avoid contact. The plan was unfolding with diabolical precision, but the masters of the Pandemic underestimated one thing... the people. Medical professionals and every-day citizens are sharing critical information online. The overlords of big tech have ordered all dissenting voices to be silenced and banned, but they are too late. The slumbering masses are awake and aware that something is not right. Quarantine has provided the missing element: time. Suddenly, our overworked citizenry has ample time to research and investigate for themselves. Once you see, you can’t unsee.The window of opportunity is open like never before. For the first time in human history, we have the world’s attention. Plandemic will expose the scientific and political elite who run the scam that is our global health system, while laying out a new plan; a plan that allows all of humanity to reconnect with healing forces of nature. 2020 is the code for perfect vision. It is also the year that will go down in history as the moment we finally opened our eyes.Plandemic\n",

      "An unfounded conspiracy theory and pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.The first cases of COVID-19 were reported in China, in the city of Wuhan on December 31. On that day, China alerted the WHO about several cases of pneumonia from an unknown cause. Some of those infected worked at the city's Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which is believed to be the place where the new disease originated. Very quickly, the number of those infected rose to over 40.On January 13, the coronavirus was confirmed in Thailand, in Japan on January 16 and in North Korea and the United States on January 20. In Japan, the first case of coronavirus was confirmed in a resident of Kanagawa Prefecture who had travelled to Wuhan at the beginning of January.The first case in Italy was confirmed on January 30, when two Chinese tourists in Rome tested positive for the virus. A week later the third case was confirmed in an Italian man who was repatriated back to Italy from Wuhan.\n",

      "With weeks of “social distancing” now behind us, many of us are finding it hard not to feel overwhelmed by daily COVID-19 updates. As we enter April, the total number of worldwide cases is over one million, with nearly 60000 confirmed deaths.  With so much at risk, doctors are increasingly looking to high dose vitamin C as a potential therapy.Of course, the naysayers will claim that “believing” in vitamin C is a reckless pursuit or downplay its significance by saying it’s just a “snake oil” remedy.  But, in reality, vitamin C has a long list of health benefits – not the least of which is fighting inflammation and reducing the risk of infections. It’s no wonder a prestigious medical journal advises the use of this powerful antioxidant as a treatment of severe COVID-19 cases.Doctors recommend high dose vitamin C as potential treatment for COVID-19 sufferers, backed by decades of scientific research. The use of vitamin C to treat and prevent respiratory infections is well-supported by research, including a 2004 systematic review from Military Medicine, which found up to a 100 percent reduction in pneumonia within experimental groups receiving high dose vitamin C treatment.Additional studies have also shown that vitamin C (ascorbic acid) can block the sepsis-induced process which normally causes immune-mediated inflammatory molecules to accumulate in the lungs and destroy lung function – exactly what we see happening in people experiencing severe complications of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.For this reason, a new commentary article published by The Lancet Respiratory Medicine has included the use of high dose vitamin C as a rescue therapy for people with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by COVID-19.Currently, a team of researchers in China are recruiting people for a randomized controlled study of high dose vitamin C therapy in COVID-19 patients. In their study description from ClinicalTrials.gov, they hypothesize that infusion with vitamin C will improve the prognosis of people suffering from the severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) caused by the novel coronavirus, for the reasons stated above.The study, which began on February 14 and is expected to conclude on September 30 later this year, is officially called “Vitamin C Infusion for the Treatment of Severe 2019-nCoV Infected Pneumonia: a Prospective Randomized Clinical Trial.”Do you have insufficient levels of key vitamins and minerals? Know the signs and boost your health with these strategies\n",
      "One of the main take-home points of many holistic healthcare practitioners and functional medicine doctors is that being clinically deficient in certain nutrients is problematic, but even sub-clinically insufficient nutrient levels (which, by definition, are typically missed by conventional blood tests) can have a negative impact on your health, too.Signs of nutrient depletion, even at subclinical levels, can range from inconveniencing (like hair loss and numbness in your fingers) to life-altering (like chronic fatigue and increased frequency of colds and infections).That’s why it’s so important to do things that help you build a deep well of nutrients to draw from. You may be surprised to know eating whole foods and taking high quality supplements aren’t the only things that can help with this – although they certainly rank way up there in terms of lifestyle priority.No matter what is going on right now in the world or in your own health and home, here are a few important things you can do to optimize your nutritional status and make sure your body has all the raw material (in the form of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants) it needs to thrive and fight off illnesses:Manage your stress: Excessive stress (and the cascade of biological and neurochemical changes that comes with it), can deplete your body of important nutrients like vitamin B6.Protect your gut health: Eating fiber-rich foods like chickpeas can boost gut health, which is essential for strengthening immunity and increasing the ability of your digestive system to actually absorb the nutrients from your food.  Gut health is also boosted with the other suggestions on this list.\n",
      "Stop smoking: Now’s as good a time as any to quit smoking, since we know nicotine and other substances found in tobacco products can impair mineral and vitamin absorption. Looking for extra incentive? Early research indicates that people who smoke or use e-cigarettes are significantly more likely to suffer severe complications of COVID-19 compared to non-smokers.Stay physically active: Optimal health depends on good circulation.Drink water: No doubt, good hydration – with clean, purified water – is central to great health.Eat organic food: Stay way from those nasty (unwanted) chemicals – as much as possible – which contribute to compromised immune function.And, one final note, just in case you do need serious medical attention: always be sure you have access to a qualified (experienced) integrative healthcare provider.  That person could literally save your life.Consider vitamin C for acute respiratory distress syndrome from COVID-19, Medical Journal says\n",

      "As of January 28, up to 20 Chinese cities have been locked down or targeted by partial movement restrictions, with public transport in and out of them closed over the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). A total of 106 people died of the disease. 976 patients remained in critical conditions. 6973 people were suspected of being infected, while 4515 cases were confirmed.Troops clad in hazmat suits, with automatic rifles were deployed, and namely in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province. The city that houses approximately 11 million people is the center of the crisis. In total, approximately, 60 million people are under travel restrictions.Additionally, 8 confirmed cases were reported in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, 7 in Macao Special Administrative Region and 5 in Taiwan.Chinese authorities are urgently building a 1000-bed emergency field hospital, specifically to cure those infected by the coronavirus.  The hospital is modeled after the Xiaotangshan SARS hospital in Beijing. The facility will be a prefabricated structure on a 270000-square-foot lot, slated for completion on February 3.The SARS hospital was built from scratch in 2003 in just six days during an outbreak of a similar respiratory virus that had spread from China to more than a dozen countries and killed about 800 people. The SATRS hospital featured individual isolation units that looked like rows of tiny cabins.On January 26, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention announced that China started to develop vaccine for the novel coronavirus after successfully isolating the first strain of the virus.All people entering and leaving China are having their temperature measured.Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause respiratory illnesses such as the common cold, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Most people get infected with coronaviruses at one point in their lives, but symptoms are typically mild to moderate. In some cases, the viruses can cause lower-respiratory tract illnesses such as pneumonia and bronchitis.\n",
      "These are more common in animals, and only a handful are known to affect humans, as is the case now. This is what happened with the coronaviruses known as the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV, between 2012-17) and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-Cov, 2002-3), both of which are known to cause more severe symptoms.The 2019-nCoV virus has spread, at a relatively rapid pace. The first case was reported on December 31st, 2019, in Wuhan, China. The first cured individual, named Chen, a 56-year old woman was reported by Chinese authorities, as per Chinese media. She spent 2 weeks in hospital and was fully cured. Since then, the virus has appeared in several other countries, including Thailand, Japan, South Korea, and the United States. The first U.S. case was confirmed on January 21st in a man in Washington state who had recently traveled to Wuhan. On January 24th, officials confirmed a second case in a woman from Chicago who had also recently traveled to the Chinese city. On January 24th, the first three cases were confirmed in France, with two patients being hospitalised in Paris and the other in the southwestern city of Bordeaux. Australia also confirmed its first case of the virus. On January 28th, three suspected cases of the coronavirus were reported in the Indian capital.The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the new coronavirus an “emergency in China,” but not an international concern.\n",
      "According to the Imperial College London‌, self-sustaining human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) is the only plausible explanation of the scale of the outbreak in Wuhan. The released report estimates that on average, each case infected 2.6 (uncertainty range: 1.5-3.5) other people up to 18th January 2020. For comparison, during the SARS outbreak each case infected from 2.0 to 3.5 other people.“This implies that control measures need to block well over 60% of transmission to be effective in controlling the outbreak. It is likely, based on the experience of SARS and MERS-CoV, that the number of secondary cases caused by a case of 2019-nCoV is highly variable – with many cases causing no secondary infections, and a few causing many. Whether transmission is continuing at the same rate currently depends on the effectiveness of current control measures implemented in China and the extent to which the populations of affected areas have adopted risk-reducing behaviours,” the report reads.So far, the 2019-nCoV mortality rate has been approximately 2.35%. Therefore, the 2019-nCoV speed of spreading, as well as the fatality percentage is in reality lower than SARS, which took place in 2002-3, also in China. In total, there were 8098 confirmed cases of SARS, with a mortality rate of 9.6%. The virus was contacted from bats. The MERS, which spread in the Middle East, between 2012-17, had a confirmed number of 2000 infected, and a mortality rate of 36%. It was contacted from camels.The Chinese government is taking extraordinary measures to prevent the spread of the 2019-nCoV. Military men in biological protection suits, blocked cities, and hospital construction efforts allow mainstream media outlets to paint an apocalyptic picture of the developments, claiming a pseudo-apocalyptic endemic that would threaten hundreds of thousands, if not millions. Countries such as the UK, the US, and others are carrying out coronavirus tests of various individuals. Mostly of Chinese origin, or those that have recently been to China.One of the speculations is that the 2019-nCoV outbreak is a result of the leak from a secret (not very) laboratory. One of the Chinese BSL-4 rated labs (highest level of biological safety) is located in Wuhan.A laboratory in Wuhan is on the cusp of being cleared to work with the world’s most dangerous pathogens. The move is part of a plan to build between five and seven biosafety level-4 (BSL-4) labs across the Chinese mainland by 2025, and has generated much excitement, as well as some concerns.Some scientists outside China worry about pathogens escaping, and the addition of a biological dimension to geopolitical tensions between China and other nations. But Chinese microbiologists are celebrating their entrance to the elite cadre empowered to wrestle with the world’s greatest biological threats,” The Nature article from February 2017 starts.Regardless facts, speculations of the biolab in Wuhan became pretty popular, claiming that this is, in fact, a real-life Resident Evil scenario, and its infamous Umbrella Corporation, minus people turning into mindless zombies roaming the streets.Another popular culture comparison is that with the popular game Plague Inc., and that as soon as Greenland hears a Chinese man has sneezed at an airport and it’s closed its borders, and that every other country should follow suit.The media hysteria has gone so far that the developer of Plague Inc., Ndemic Creations, issued a statement saying that their game is realistic, but not with the aim to sensationalize serious world issues. It warned that this is, in fact a game, and not a scientific model.Rather dark memes are on the rise, with there even being a specific subreddit focused on coronavirus jokes. Most are harmless jokes, but many of them are tasteless, but they also serve the purpose of presenting China in a light that it is losing grip of the situation.The apocalyptic coverage of the 2019-nCoV outbreak in China demonstrates how mainstream media outlets and social media platforms shape the audience’s perception of reality. While the Chinese government appears to be employing needed measures to contain the outbreak and prevent the virus spread, the MSM uses this measures to feed the audience with speculations that this is a signal of the Chinese inability to keep the situation under control.PSEUDO-APOCALYPSE: CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK IN CHINA\n",

The claim is false.The Reuters Fact Check team previously debunked a claim that Bill Gates planned to launch microchip skin implants to fight the coronavirus ( here ). The claim emerged after a Reddit Q&A in which Gates mentioned foreseeing the use of “digital certificates” to show who has been tested for COVID-19 or who has recovered from the disease ( here ). Most of the iterations of this claim misleadingly refer to “quantum dot dye” technology, which was founded by the Gates Foundation. Kevin McHugh, one of the lead authors of the “quantum dot dye” research paper, confirmed to Reuters this technology is not a microchip or human implantable capsule. Instead, it is similar to a tattoo, which would help provide up-to-date patient vaccine records for professionals in places lacking medical records. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation told Reuters via email that: “The reference to ‘digital certificates’ relates to efforts to create an open source digital platform with the goal of expanding access to safe, home-based testing.” Reuters found no evidence of any statement given by Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID, part of National Institutes of Health), regarding vaccination certificates. The viral posts might stem from a CNN interview in which Dr Fauci said the idea of Americans carrying “certificates of immunity” in the future is “possible”. He added that this “might have some merit in certain circumstance” (at the 2:48 mark  here ).According to Dr Fauci, these certificates would identify those who have tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies, rather than a potential vaccine. He confirmed these are already being discussed by the White House coronavirus task force and would be useful for vulnerable people and health workers ( here ). While the U.S. Government certainly appears to be considering “certificates of immunity”, as of May 4, 2020, Reuters did not find evidence suggesting Fauci thought it compulsory that Americans would have to carry immunity certificates in the future.The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently warned governments against issuing “immunity passports” as there is no evidence that recovered patients cannot be reinfected ( here ). In late April, Chile confirmed it will move forward with coronavirus “release certificates” for recovered coronavirus patients, but that these documents will not certify immunity ( https:// www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-chile/in-reversal-chile-says-coronavirus-release-certificates-will-not-prove-immunity-idUSKBN22B2ZY ).  VERDICT. False. Bill Gates foresees the use of “digital certificates” with health records but did not say these would be in the form of microchip implants. Dr. Fauci has accepted the possibility of Americans carrying “certificates of immunity” in the future, not vaccination certificates.This article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.

      "FOR AS LONG as there have been mobile networks, there have been health concerns about the radiation they emit. At first, people worried they would cause cancer. The fifth generation of networks, or 5G, aroused fears of headaches, rashes and severe skin burns.Lack of evidence has not put paid to these suspicions. Last year councils in Frome, Glastonbury and Totnes banned the rollout of the technology, backbenchers in Parliament debated the matter, and EE, a mobile network, had so many concerned calls that it dedicated a team to dealing with them.Covid-19 has given conspiracy theorists a new angle. Some pointed out that Wuhan, where the virus originated, was also one of the first cities in China to get 5G coverage. That was where their relationship with reality came to an end.Several strains of the theory have emerged. One is that 5G weakens immune systems, another that it inhibits oxygen intake, exacerbating the disease, a third that covid-19 does not exist but is a cover for 5G-related diseases that governments are trying to hush up. Amanda Holden, a TV personality, tweeted a (now-deleted) petition linking 5G with coronavirus. On April 7th, YouTube removed an interview with David Icke, a conspiracy theorist, repeating the story, and said it would ban all such content.The theories have spread like wildfire in Africa, America and Europe, says Hanna Linderstal of Earhart, a security and risk-management firm, with Europeans the most enthusiastic proponents. Last week, they led to literal fires: mobile networks’ tower masts were set alight in Birmingham and Merseyside. Workers laying fibre-optic cable have been harassed in the street.Ms Linderstal analysed dozens of videos on social-media platforms. Many of them contain “expert advice” on “how you cure the virus with cold air and move away from 5G antenna or even destroy the 5G antenna to save your family”. Though the videos’ origins are unclear, the people spreading them are mostly worried rather than malign, she says. Yet at a time when Britons are stuck at home and unusually reliant on mobile networks and broadband to connect to the outside world, the actions of a small group of scared citizens risk causing real harm—unlike the tower masts they are burning down.How 5G conspiracy theories used covid-19 to go viral\n",

      "U.S. military documents show that, in 1992, the CDC’s current Director Robert Redfield and his then-assistant, Deborah Birx—both Army medical officers—knowingly falsified scientific data published in the New England Journal of Medicine fraudulently claiming that an HIV vaccine they helped develop was effective. They knew the vaccine was worthless.Redfield now runs the agency charged with mandating COVID vaccines. Birx, a life-long protégé to both Redfield and Anthony Fauci, served on the board of Bill Gates’ Global Fund. Redfield, Birx and Fauci lead the White House coronavirus task force.A subsequent Air Force tribunal on Scientific Fraud and Misconduct agreed that Redfield’s misleading or, possibly, deceptive information seriously threatens his credibility as a researcher. In 1992, two military investigators charged Redfield and Birx with engaging in “a systematic pattern of data manipulation, inappropriate statistical analyses and misleading data presentation in an apparent attempt to promote the usefulness of the GP160 AIDS vaccine.” A subsequent Air Force tribunal on Scientific Fraud and Misconduct agreed that Redfield’s “misleading or, possibly, deceptive” information “seriously threatens his credibility as a researcher and has the potential to negatively impact AIDS research funding for military institutions as a whole. His allegedly unethical behavior creates false hope and could result in premature deployment of the vaccine.” The tribunal recommended investigation by a “fully independent outside investigative body.” Dr. Redfield confessed to D.O.D. interrogators and to the tribunal, that his analyses were faulty and deceptive. He agreed to publicly correct them. Afterward, he continued making his false claims at three subsequent international HIV conferences, and perjured himself in testimony before Congress, swearing that his vaccine cured HIV.Their gambit worked. Based upon his testimony, Congress appropriated $20 million to the military to support Redfield and Birx’s research project. Public Citizen complained in a 1994 letter to the Congressional Committee’s Henry Waxman that the money caused the Army to kill the investigation and “whitewash” Redfield’s crimes. The fraud propelled Birx and Redfield into stellar careers as health officials.Redfield and Birx: Can they be trusted with COVID?\n",

      "Some critically ill patients with COVID-19 have been treated with high doses of intravenous (IV) vitamin C in the hope that it will hasten recovery. However, there is no clear or convincing scientific evidence that it works for COVID-19 infections, and it is not a standard part of treatment for this new infection. A study is underway in China to determine if this treatment is useful for patients with severe COVID-19; results are expected in the fall.The idea that high-dose IV vitamin C might help in overwhelming infections is not new. A 2017 study found that high-dose IV vitamin C treatment (along with thiamine and corticosteroids) appeared to prevent deaths among people with sepsis, a form of overwhelming infection causing dangerously low blood pressure and organ failure. Another study published last year assessed the effect of high-dose vitamin C infusions among patients with severe infections who had sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), in which the lungs fill with fluid. While the study's main measures of improvement did not improve within the first four days of vitamin C therapy, there was a lower death rate at 28 days among treated patients. Though neither of these studies looked at vitamin C use in patients with COVID-19, the vitamin therapy was specifically given for sepsis and ARDS, and these are the most common conditions leading to intensive care unit admission, ventilator support, or death among those with severe COVID-19 infections.Regarding prevention, there is no evidence that taking vitamin C will help prevent infection with the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. While standard doses of vitamin C are generally harmless, high doses can cause a number of side effects, including nausea, cramps, and an increased risk of kidney stones.I've heard that high-dose vitamin C is being used to treat patients with COVID-19.

      "Amid a pandemic panic over the coronavirus, evidence for a possibly effective treatment has been denounced as ‘fake news’ – even when offered by a renowned scientist with decades of experience.Take Didier Raoult, a French microbiologist with undeniable expertise, even if some of his views are about as eccentric as his appearance. Though he may look like he just stepped out of an Alexandre Dumas novel, the director of the Mediterranean University Hospital Institute in Marseille cited not one but three different studies from China showing that the anti-malaria drug called chloroquine has been effective in treating Covid-19 patients. That did not stop Le Monde, France’s biggest newspaper, of declaring his February 25 video as “partially false.” Raoult’s 'sin' was to argue that the common anti-malaria drug used widely for decades resulted in “dramatic improvements” among those afflicted by the virus.As a result of Le Monde’s fact-check, anyone attempting to share Dr. Raoult’s videos on Facebook gets a banner saying the information therein was “partially false” as “determined by independent fact-checkers.” The main argument put forward by those critical of the drug is that more testing is required before it can be officially approved as treatment for the coronavirus. As the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) puts it, “There are no currently available data from Randomized Clinical Trials…to inform clinical guidance on the use, dosing, or duration of hydroxychloroquine” treatments for Covid-19.Which is fair enough, but last time I checked, there was a pandemic going on, with billions of people locked in their homes and all business grinding to a halt across the globe, over apocalyptic predictions of hospitals brimming with corpses due to this coronavirus.Should any kind of treatment – especially a drug that has been used safely for decades to treat something else, with side effects meticulously documented – be so cavalierly rejected, under the circumstances? Do “experts” really think the world has the luxury of waiting for months or even years for their controlled lab studies?As for the fact-checkers, shouldn’t they have applied the same rigor to the models used to scare everyone into hoarding toilet paper and setting off a depression orders of magnitude worse than anything the world has ever seen?To ask these questions is to answer them, yet no one seems to bother. Nor is this sort of selective blindness endemic to France; across the Atlantic, the mainstream media raised their voices in unison against chloroquine after US President Donald Trump brought it up as a possible treatment – apparently referring to Dr. Raoult’s work. They went so far as to widely circulate a deliberately misleading story about an Arizona couple that ate fish tank cleaner – chloroquine phosphate, clearly labeled not for human consumption – as somehow Trump’s fault. Some of them quietly amended it to specify the difference, but long after the original story – implying they took the actual medication praised by the president – literally went viral and poisoned the minds of millions. Worse yet, as a result of this media blitz, the governor of Nevada actually banned using chloroquine to treat Covid-19 patients this week, saying there was “no consensus among experts or Nevada doctors” that the anti-malaria drug can treat coronavirus sufferers. There were no angry editorials denouncing Steve Sisolak, a Democrat, for letting people die or the coronavirus rather than have them treated with a drug endorsed by the Republican president and the media’s favorite hate object.One would think the world paralyzed with fear of the invisible death would pounce on every possible solution, no matter how unlikely it seems. That’s what we’re shown in Hollywood disaster movies, after all. Yet when such a solution presents itself, it is dismissed and denounced as “not proven”! We’re supposed to blindly trust apocalyptic models produced by panic-mongering political hacks, but ignore the man who says the drug brought him back from the brink of death, even though his story can be easily verified and theirs cannot. “Preferring opinions to facts is a disease,” Dr. Raoult told the French magazine Marianne last week. Just so.I don’t know if hydroxychloroquine works on Covid-19. Dr. Raoult seems to believe so, and he’s not alone. In the absence of better solutions – and locking billions of people in their homes indefinitely is not one – don’t we owe humanity to at least try? What do we have to lose? In the three months or so since the coronavirus first appeared in China, there has been a lot of conflicting, confusing and outright false information about it. One thing that has consistently proven true, however, is that the biggest obstacle in effectively battling its spread and treating the afflicted has been the obtuse insistence of the political and medical establishment on blindly following their rules. If the virus is truly threatening to kill millions, as they say, they would not value procedures over saving lives. Nevertheless, they persist. It makes one wonder why.This scientist suggested a drug to treat Covid-19. 'Fact checkers' branded him fake news\n",

Yes we do,” says Dr. Dan Erickson.The two say they have their own statistics that show COVID-19 is similar to the flu.Dr. Daniel Erickson is questioning the effectiveness of going into lockdown to prevent the spread of coronavirus. He believes we should be focusing on \"Herd Immunity\" and backed up his claim with statistics on Good Morning San Diego. sheltering in place would lead to a weakening of the immune system, because this would limit exposure to “normal bacteria and normal flora”. While it is correct that healthy development of the immune system requires exposure to microorganisms like bacteria, fungi, and viruses, sheltering in place would not minimize exposure to microorganisms to the extent of causing immune dysfunction.Dr. Daniel Erickson pushes to lift California stay at home orders because lockdowns have minimal benefits\n",

      "The coronavirus has given rise to a flood of conspiracy theories, disinformation and propaganda, eroding public trust and undermining health officials in ways that could elongate and even outlast the pandemic.Claims that the virus is a foreign bioweapon, a partisan invention or part of a plot to re-engineer the population have replaced a mindless virus with more familiar, comprehensible villains. Each claim seems to give a senseless tragedy some degree of meaning, however dark.Rumors of secret cures — diluted bleach, turning off your electronics, bananas — promise hope of protection from a threat that not even world leaders can escape.\n",
      "The belief that one is privy to forbidden knowledge offers feelings of certainty and control amid a crisis that has turned the world upside down. And sharing that “knowledge” may give people something that is hard to come by after weeks of lockdowns and death: a sense of agency.“It has all the ingredients for leading people to conspiracy theories,” said Karen M. Douglas, a social psychologist who studies belief in conspiracies at the University of Kent in Britain.Rumors and patently unbelievable claims are spread by everyday people whose critical faculties have simply been overwhelmed, psychologists say, by feelings of confusion and helplessness.But many false claims are also being promoted by governments looking to hide their failures, partisan actors seeking political benefit, run-of-the-mill scammers and, in the United States, a president who has pushed unproven cures and blame-deflecting falsehoods.The conspiracy theories all carry a common message: The only protection comes from possessing the secret truths that “they” don’t want you to hear.The feelings of security and control offered by such rumors may be illusory, but the damage to the public trust is all too real.It has led people to consume fatal home remedies and flout social distancing guidance. And it is disrupting the sweeping collective actions, like staying at home or wearing masks, needed to contain a virus that has already killed more than 79000 people.“We’ve faced pandemics before,” said Graham Brookie, who directs the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab. “We haven’t faced a pandemic at a time when humans are as connected and have as much access to information as they do now.”This growing ecosystem of misinformation and public distrust has led the World Health Organization to warn of an “infodemic.”“You see the space being flooded,” Mr. Brookie said, adding, “The anxiety is viral, and we’re all just feeling that at scale.”The Allure of ‘Secret Knowledge’.“People are drawn to conspiracies because they promise to satisfy certain psychological motives that are important to people,” Dr. Douglas said. Chief among them: command of the facts, autonomy over one’s well-being and a sense of control.If the truth does not fill those needs, we humans have an incredible capacity to invent stories that will, even when some part of us knows they are false. A recent study found that people are significantly likelier to share false coronavirus information than they are to believe it.“The magnitude of misinformation spreading in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic is overwhelming our small team,” Snopes, a fact-checking site, said on Twitter. “We’re seeing scores of people, in a rush to find any comfort, make things worse as they share (sometimes dangerous) misinformation.”Widely shared, Instagram posts falsely suggested that the coronavirus was planned by Bill Gates on behalf of pharmaceutical companies. In Alabama, Facebook posts falsely claimed that shadowy powers had ordered sick patients to be secretly helicoptered into the state. In Latin America, equally baseless rumors have proliferated that the virus was engineered to spread H.I.V. In Iran, pro-government voices portray the disease as a Western plot.If the claims are seen as taboo, all the better.The belief that we have access to secret information may help us feel that we have an advantage, that we are somehow safer. “If you believe in conspiracy theories, then you have power through knowledge that other people don’t have,” Dr. Douglas said.Italian media buzzed over a video posted by an Italian man from Tokyo in which he claimed that the coronavirus was treatable but that Italian officials were “hiding the truth.”Other videos, popular on YouTube, claim that the entire pandemic is a fiction staged to control the population.Still others say that the disease is real, but its cause isn’t a virus — it’s 5G cellular networks.One YouTube video pushing this falsehood, and implying that social distancing measures could be ignored, has received 1.9 million views. In Britain, there has been a rash of attacks on cellular towers.Conspiracy theories may also make people feel less alone. Few things tighten the bonds of “us” like rallying against “them,” especially foreigners and minorities, both frequent scapegoats of coronavirus rumors and much else before now.But whatever comfort that affords is short-lived.Over time, research finds, trading in conspiracies not only fails to satisfy our psychological needs, Dr. Douglas said, but also tends to worsen feelings of fear or helplessness.And that can lead us to seek out still more extreme explanations, like addicts looking for bigger and bigger hits.Governments Find Opportunity in Confusion. The homegrown conspiracists and doubters are finding themselves joined by governments. Anticipating political backlash from the crisis, government leaders have moved quickly to shunt the blame by trafficking in false claims of their own.A senior Chinese official pushed claims that the virus was introduced to China by members of the United States Army, an accusation that was allowed to flourish on China’s tightly controlled social media.In Venezuela, President Nicolás Maduro suggested that the virus was an American bioweapon aimed at China. In Iran, officials called it a plot to suppress the vote there. And outlets that back the Russian government, including branches in Western Europe, have promoted claims that the United States engineered the virus to undermine China’s economy.In the former Soviet republics of Turkmenistan and Tajikistan, leaders praised bogus treatments and argued that citizens should continue working.But officials have hardly refrained from the rumor mongering in more democratic nations, particularly those where distrust of authority has given rise to strong populist movements.Matteo Salvini, the leader of Italy’s anti-migrant League Party, wrote on Twitter that China had devised a “lung supervirus” from “bats and rats.”And President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil has repeatedly promoted unproven coronavirus treatments, and implied that the virus is less dangerous than experts say. Facebook, Twitter and YouTube all took the extraordinary step of removing the posts.President Trump, too, has repeatedly pushed unproven drugs, despite warnings from scientists and despite at least one fatal overdose of a man whose wife said he had taken a drug at Mr. Trump’s suggestion.Mr. Trump has accused perceived enemies of seeking to “inflame” the coronavirus “situation” to hurt him. When supplies of personal protective equipment fell short at New York hospitals, he implied that health workers might be stealing masks.His allies have gone further.Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, and others have suggested that the virus may have been produced by a Chinese weapons lab. Some media allies have claimed that the death toll has been inflated by Mr. Trump’s enemies.A Parallel Crisis. “This kind of information suppression is dangerous — really, really dangerous,” Mr. Brookie said, referring to Chinese and American efforts to play down the threat of the outbreak.It has nourished not just individual conspiracies but a wider sense that official sources and data cannot be trusted, and a growing belief that people must find the truth on their own.A cacophony arising from armchair epidemiologists who often win attention through sensational claims is at times crowding out legitimate experts whose answers are rarely as tidy or emotionally reassuring.They promise easy cures, like avoiding telecommunications or even eating bananas. They wave off the burdens of social isolation as unnecessary. Some sell sham treatments of their own.“Medical conspiracy theories have the power to increase distrust in medical authorities, which can impact people’s willingness to protect themselves,” Daniel Jolley and Pia Lamberty, scholars of psychology, wrote in a recent article.Such claims have been shown to make people less likely to take vaccines or antibiotics, and more likely to seek medical advice from friends and family instead of from doctors.Belief in one conspiracy also tends to increase belief in others. The consequences, experts warn, could not only worsen the pandemic, but outlive it.Medical conspiracies have been a growing problem for years. So has distrust of authority, a major driver of the world’s slide into fringe populism. Now, as the world enters an economic crisis with little modern precedent, that may deepen.The wave of coronavirus conspiracies, Dr. Jolley and Dr. Lamberty wrote, “has the potential to be just as dangerous for societies as the outbreak itself.”Why Coronavirus Conspiracy Theories Flourish.

      "Many people are waking up to the fact that the Covid-19 “pandemic” is not turning out as billed. When we finally emerge from it, the big question will be how many people have died from the virus. Here’s the most likely outcome.You can bet that the institutions of international government, and the “experts” advising them, will try to massage and cherry-pick statistics to present the version of events that most closely matches their worst-case scenarios. The fact is, according to their early predictions, we are already long overdue millions of Covid-19 deaths that have failed to materialise.But even when Covid-19 deaths are recorded, we have seen how it could be that people are dying with coronavirus rather than dying of it. This concept is easy enough to understand, and it encourages one to take a closer look at the breakdown of deaths across an entire society. The more you follow this rabbit hole down, the more interesting the numbers become. It may be somewhat morbid, but it is nonetheless very important.The most popular twoarticles on the website of The Spectator over the weekend were by Dr John Lee, a recently retired NHS consultant and professor of pathology. He remarks that ‘’we have yet to see any statistical evidence for excess deaths, in any part of the world’’.To check this out, I looked at the British government’s own statistics on total deaths registered weekly across the UK. It shows that in the week ending on the 8th of March 2019, 10898 people died in total in the UK. This year, in the week ending the 6th of March 2020, the equivalent figure was almost identical: 10895. Make of that what you will. Statistics are currently available up to March 20, and while there is a lag between the spread of the virus and the resulting deaths, so far only about 1 percent of all mortalities bear any relation to coronavirus, and there is no visible spike. If nothing else, it helps to view the extent of the crisis in proportion - thousands of people die each week, and from the long-term view what we are seeing is not a plague, but a blip.So when all is said and done, will any additional people die of the coronavirus? And what is meant by extra or additional?Risk of dying. Understanding this requires a bit of lateral thinking, but it helps to remember that everyone on Earth has a terminal disease: being alive. We all have to go sometime.Recording exactly how and when we do is a big part of the job of statistician Professor Sir David Spiegelhalter. In a recent blog post, he outlined the concept of background risk. This is obtained by recording all of the people dying in any given year, at any given age. At its most simple, this is the percentage chance a person has of not reaching their next birthday, based solely on their age. Of course, that is not to say that if you are a 40-year-old man you have precisely a 0.2% chance of dying this year - the data are based on averages, and do not apply to individuals.But nonetheless, across a country or given populations, the averages will be right, and it is possible to predict with great accuracy how many people will die in a given year. In the UK, for example, 600000 people die annually. But wait a minute! A novel, brand-spanking new coronavirus is terrorising us all. Therefore surely we can expect more people to die this year than would in a normal year? And come year’s end we should be able, with simple arithmetic, to count exactly how many more there were.Spiegelhalter, chair of the Winton Centre for Evidence and Risk Communication at Cambridge University, won’t say exactly what he does think that figure will be. But he does say that if the deaths are towards the lower end of the current estimates, say at around 20000 in the UK, Covid-19 will end up having ‘’a minimal impact on overall mortality for 2020’’. He told R4 that his findings showed, to his own professed astonishment, that if someone contracts the coronavirus, they’ve got almost exactly the same chance of dying over the ensuing few weeks as they would normally have of dying over the next year, no matter what their age or background health.And depending on who you ask, that 20000 figure might still be an overestimate. In fact, Spiegelhalter says that if extra people die it will likely be as a result of the  knock-on effects of the lockdown, such as delayed normal health care, depression and isolation.American political commentator Candace Owens has been Tweeting consistently about the apparent insignificance of Covid-19 deaths compared to overall trends. She tweeted about this issue in relation to New York City, where meaningless figures are being waved around by the media.Final destination\n",
      "With all of the numbers being bandied about these days by various universities and governments, one would swear that they knew exactly what they were talking about. Make no mistake: this air of certainty is just a front. It is definitely too early to accurately gauge how many – if any – extra people will die because of coronavirus. It will depend on how four key pieces of information intersect.These are:How many people will become infected by Covid-19?How much does Covid-19 increase the risk of death?Are deaths being properly recorded? Of those people who die having contracted coronavirus, are they dying from the virus, or just with it?Of those who died, how many had comorbidities that would have killed them this year anyway?Since all of this began, the mainstream media have focused almost entirely on the first of these points, and stressing with an onslaught of material how important it is to slow the spread. The most extreme possible measures have been implemented to do that. Meanwhile, the three other points could end up comparing Covid-19 pretty much to the common flu. Only careful consideration by governments of all the key factors will result in the best future decisions.It is hard to believe that when this all blows over, the damage that will have been done by the shutdown measures – to businesses, to civil liberties, to individual lives and, of course, to the global economy – could have been for nothing. Nonetheless, it seems entirely possible based on the present data. Remember above all to not  take the figures the mainstream media throw at you at face value; there are lies, damned lies and statistics.Covid-19’s meant to be a new Black Death, but in Britain no more people are dying than NORMAL.

Yet, he notes, the last 2 decades, vaccine hesitancy has risen so substantially that “old enemies once thought conquered are returning.”Cultural amnesia is largely to blame, Hartlage writes. “Vaccines largely erased fear of these diseases from our collective American consciousness; along with it, our sense of appreciation ... Now, however, that fear has been rekindled.”He sees promising signs, though, that humans—once again \"forced to grapple with our own human frailty,” will unite for the common good in a new era of social responsibility.

Last week, we updated you about the good news that came out of New York City after Dr. Vladimir Zelenko reported that he treated 699 coronavirus patients with 100% success using Hydroxychloroquine Sulfate, Zinc and Z-Pak. As mainstream media continues to downplay the positive effect of Hydroxychloroquine Sulfate, Zinc and Z-Pak in the treatment of coronavirus patients, we have been doing our best to get the words out there and hopefully save many lives.In a new video post, Dr. Vladimir Zelenko provides important update regarding the treatment regimen. He’s also sounded warning about shortage of the Hydroxychloroquine Sulfate, Zinc and Z-Pak. He’s asking people to donate drugs (not money) to give to patients in New York. To date, Dr. Zelenko has treated 350 COVID-19 patients using, Hydroxychloroquine 200mg 2x daily, Azithromycin 500mg 1x daily, Zinc Sulfate 220mg 1x daily.Dr. Zelenko said there is 100% recovery rate with normal breathing restored within 3-4 hours and no intubation.

      "New Zealand – the “land of the long white cloud” – has evolved into a police state overnight amid the fallout of Covid-19, with people now being encouraged to dob in fellow Kiwis who flout lockdown rules.While slow to apprehend Covid-19 initially and taking nonsensical measures such as banning travel from Iran while allowing travel from Italy unabated, the New Zealand government quickly changed tack and announced it was implementing a four-tier threat level to deal with the virus. It wasn’t long after this that the government gave New Zealanders a two-day period for everyone to tie up loose ends and prepare for what is essentially a nationwide lockdown (threat level four), which will continue for at least four weeks.As part of this, a state of emergency was declared last week which saw the powers-that-be activate emergency legislation. This current state of affairs enables New Zealand’s National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to close or restrict access to roads or public places, regulate land, water and air traffic, and even evacuate and enter people’s premises, among other measures. The New Zealand police are responsible for maintaining law and order during the state of emergency, and have been given special powers to order any person to stop any activity that contributes to the emergency. As of today, the state of emergency has been extended by another seven days.So, what? I hear you ask. The Covid-19 crisis is an unprecedented situation which can lead to immense death and suffering, and has already begun undertaking that course of action in Italy, Iran, Spain and even in the US. Calling New Zealand’s response a descent into a “police state” is nothing more than a conspiracy theory, aimed at fueling and sparking more panic in an already panic-driven environment.Well, perhaps you might want to tell that Victoria University’s associate law professor, Dean Knight, who said that with so much discretionary power, there is a very real risk that the discretion could be used in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner. Or how about University of Otago law professor, Andrew Geddis, who has questioned the current state of affairs in two separate op-eds, warning that police can use “extreme and unprecedented” powers to constrain basic freedoms of movement guaranteed by the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act.We could say the same of Radio New Zealand contributor Catriona MacLenna, who penned an open letter to the country’s police with the aim of making it crystal clear that “New Zealand is a democracy,” “not a police state.”We might also want to tell that to journalist Damian Christie. Christie was in the process of delivering video equipment to a client’s business with a letter firmly in hand to prove that what he was doing was regarded as being part of an essential service, his client being a large food producer. Despite producing this letter (and having no discernible legal obligation to do so), a police officer who stopped him began to yell at him and flat-out ignored the letter, even though we had been told that if we provide such a letter, we won’t experience any issues. According to the officer, however, Christie should only have left his house to buy medical supplies.This is clearly untrue and, as Professor Geddis notes in his columns, has created much confusion about what we can and can’t do under the lockdown rules. I agree with Geddis that if there has been an instruction given to the police to apply these powers, then we need to see those instructions.On top of all of this, the government saw fit in the most Orwellian way possible to set up an online mechanism for locals to “dob in” other fellow Kiwis who were flouting the lockdown rules. Within an hour of it being launched, over-zealous New Zealanders crashed the website with over 4200 reports lodged. Police have also arrested a number of people for breaching the lockdown rules. I expect this number to climb somewhat over the next three weeks.I don’t know how comfortable I am with a website where people can dob in other people without requiring any demonstrable evidence. I am also concerned as to what this precedent could achieve in the future. Perhaps the next lockdown won’t be because of Covid-19, but because of a different situation entirely. What if the next website is set up to dob in not flouters of the lockdown, but say, political dissidents?We are always naive in thinking that this type of activity can never occur in New Zealand, even when the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) has been found to have spied on targets illegally; or that time the Snowden papers revealed that the GCSB was spying on the entire Pacific on a mass scale without the knowledge of its neighbors. How quickly New Zealanders seem to forget these facts, or perhaps simply turn a blind eye to them from the outset.The emergence of New Zealand’s police state apparatus comes at an interesting time. The Court of Appeal just ruled last week that New Zealanders have no constitutional right to bear arms, following a failed legal challenge by the “Kiwi Party.” While denying that right, the government has been quietly rolling out an extensive armed police patrol trial which saw units deployed 75 times a day in their first five weeks (what on Earth for?)Look, I get it. I take the Covid-19 crisis as seriously as the next person, and for that matter, the overarching principles of the lockdown requirements. But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t question power and the abuse of that power, even during a national and global state of emergency.As Benjamin Franklin’s old adage goes: “Those who would give up essential liberty, to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.” And they’ll probably end up losing both.New Zealand becoming police state: Covid-19 lockdown to be taken seriously, but reporting neighbors & abuse of power goes too far\n",

      "How fake news helped this strange (and utterly false) coronavirus myth spin out of control. As fear of the deadly coronavirus has gripped the globe, there has been one rather vocal section of the world, at least online, that’s reveling in their presumed safety from the dreaded disease. You see, over on Black Twitter, folks are boasting that Black people are naturally safe from infection because we have melanin… and also ginger ale.So, um, where did all these ill-founded health rumors start? And why would Black people possibly think that our melanin is like teflon from viral infection?For starters, if you check this interactive map from the New York Times that tracks the spread of the virus, you’ll notice a few areas that have no known infections. You’ll also notice that those same areas have something else in common: They’re places where people with lots of melanin live. You put one and one together, and boom, now you have the beginnings of a quasi-scientific opinion based on an obvious observation.But really, all it took was one fake news story from Valentine’s Day for the hoteps on Facebook and Twitter to flood their feeds with this wave of disinformation. That article, from a website called CityScrollz and which has since been deleted, was later repurposed and has reappeared in more professional-appearing posts, like this one, which features the gripping headline “Chinese Doctor Says African Skin Resists Coronavirus.” A second-wave clickbait news story was published on February 16th by the Zambian Observer. Until yesterday, I’d never heard of this news site, but whatever it is, its reporting on why melanin protects Black people from coronavirus isn’t just factually challenged, it’s a dangerous lie. For instance, consider the scientific acumen of this choice passage.“The Chinese doctors confirmed that Senou stayed alive because of his blood genetic composition which is mainly found in the genetic composition of subsaharan Africans. Chinese doctors also said that he remained alive because he has black skin, the antibodies of a black are three times stronger, powerful and resistant compared to that of a white.“Zanomoya Mditshwa, an African, shared his opinion saying black man is indestructible. ‘Caucasians is always at war with our black skin because they know our melanin is our defense against all that they throw at us. This proves yet again that the black man is indestructible, our bodies are made of the same substances that make up this Earth because we are owners of this universe they will never wipe us off, history has already proved that,’ he said.”While “news” stories like this are good for a laugh, like all ignorance, they also pose a serious health risk. And this rumor has been spreading online about as quickly as the virus has been bouncing across real-world borders.The wrongheaded notion of “melanated protection” has become so commonplace Snopes had to step in to debunk it. The Associated Press Fact Check also did its journalistic due diligence to disrupt the rumor’s spread. Meanwhile, the AFP spoke with Amadou Alpha Sall, the director of the Institut Pasteur in Senegal. The institute is a research center that’s been analyzing the infection profiles of possible patients in Sub-Saharan Africa. He attempted to clear the haze of confusion by saying, “There’s no scientific evidence to support this rumor. Ethnicity and genetics have no influence on recovery from the virus, and Black people don’t have more antibodies than white people.”There is one part of this story that’s real: Senou, the Cameroonian patient referred to. And how he was returned to full health after contracting coronavirus is the story that people should actually know — even if it’s not as funny.As the BBC originally reported, Senou is a 21-year-old student from Cameroon who lives and studies in Jingzhou, China. Having previously contracted malaria as a child, Senou was legit scared when he was convinced that he’d contracted the novel coronavirus. He told the BBC, “When I was going to the hospital for the first time, I was thinking about my death and how I thought it was going to happen.” For his treatment, Chinese doctors didn’t rely on his melanin to beat the virus, nor did they trust that his “black antibodies [were] three times stronger, powerful and resistant”; instead, they gave him antibiotics and drugs usually prescribed to patients battling HIV.Two weeks of medical attention later and Senou was declared to have fully recovered. His medical treatment was fully paid for by the Chinese government. This fact alone would appear to be far more important and integral to his recovery than any racialized strength of his antibodies.Then, late last week, there was even more news that should have upset the narrative that Black people’s melanin somehow makes us naturally immune to coronavirus. That is, the first patient in Sub-Saharan Africa was diagnosed after contracting the semi-deadly illness. The victim was reported in Nigeria. Except there’s a catch: The patient isn’t Black. According to the New York Times, he’s reportedly an Italian national who works in Nigeria. Not to mention, he’d just returned to the country from a trip to Milan, which means that there’s still no official cases of a Sub-Saharan African who has contracted coronavirus. \n",
      "Interestingly, another large geographic area filled with brown people of all shades — India — has also been largely immune to coronavirus, despite the fact that it borders China for 2167 miles. But again, according to the Economic Times, this probably has more to do with the country’s supply chain (unlike its neighbors, India has been very reluctant to rely on Chinese commerce) than the color of its populace’s skin. After all, the Chinese epicenter of the viral outbreak is Wuhan, a heavily industrial city, whose products ship globally. But India isn’t buying much. If you consider how the virus has hit rural Iran, packaging of Chinese goods would make a lot of sense as a disease vector — and be far more productive to consider than “melanin protection.” Because in tough, ever-evolving cases like these, the answer is hardly ever skin-deep.ARE BLACK PEOPLE REALLY SAFE FROM CORONAVIRUS BECAUSE OF MELANIN?\n",

      "Over the past three weeks, we’ve been sharing with you the great work Dr. Zelenko, a board-certified family practitioner in New York, has been doing in the treatment of COVID-19 patients in New York. In our last piece, Dr. Vladimir Zelenko treated 700 coronavirus patients treated with 99.9% success rate using Hydroxychloroquine, 1 outpatient died after not following protocol. In the meantime, more doctors are seeing success with hydroxychloroquine and Zinc Sulphate in treating coronavirus patients, according to one report from ABC News. 12 French doctors have also filed a petition calling on French Prime Minister and Minister of Health to urgently make hydroxychloroquine available in all French hospital pharmacies. Today, we have new and encouraging updates from Dr. Zelenko. In a one-hour video, Dr. Zelenko provides a detailed medical explanation about why his cocktail of Hydroxychloroquine Sulfate, Zinc and Azithromycin (not Z-Pak) works, and why the three-drug combination are really needed in killing coronavirus.Unlike the conventional method of admitting patients to the hospitals, Dr. Zelenko’s approach is to provide treatment to patients before their situation get worse so they don’t have to be admitted into the hospital. His approach has been so effective to the point that he has treated 900 coronavirus patients with 99.99% rate. His approach is to provide treatment to people so that they don’t have to be put on ventilators. His out-patient treatment regimen, which costs only $12, is as follows:Hydroxychloroquine 200mg twice a day for 5 days. Azithromycin 500mg once a day for 5 days. Zinc sulfate 220mg once a day for 5 days. In an open letter to medical professionals across the globe, Dr. Zelenko said this: “The rationale for my treatment plan is as follows. I combined the data available from China and South Korea with the recent study published from France (sites available on request). We know that hydroxychloroquine helps Zinc enter the cell. We know that Zinc slows viral replication within the cell. Regarding the use of azithromycin, I postulate it prevents secondary bacterial infections. These three drugs are well known and usually well tolerated, hence the risk to the patient is low.”In this new must watch video, Dr. Zelenko went on to explain that hydroxychloroquine helps zinc penetrate the cell (zinc decelerates viral replication in the cell). He stated that azithromycin combats secondary infections. Dr. Zelenko is surprised that many other doctors operate with a “peace time mentality.” Instead, he calls for bravery and mindset adjustment.New updates from Dr. Vladimir Zelenko: Cocktail of Hydroxychloroquine, Zinc Sulfate and Azithromycin are showing phenomenon results with 900 coronavirus patients treated – Must Watch Video\n",

      "The old swine flu vaccine caused permanent brain damage; will the new coronavirus vaccine do the same? Following on from the announcement recently that the imminent Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19) vaccine that could be “fast tracked” to general release as early as July this year, will skip animal testing and come straight to human live trials. With little to no testing it means that the vaccine could indeed be more harmful than the virus, the extent of the dmage it could cause will be unknown. Whilst it will no doubt perpetuate the disease further through what’s known as “shedding”, it will increase the viral spread, yet any cause of death will be attributed to the Corona Virus. So we would need more vaccines to stop it! As reported on Vaccine.news: Several years back when everyone was freaking out about the H1N1 swine flu, health authorities promised a “miracle” vaccine that, in the end, was shown to be far more dangerous than the swine flu itself because it caused permanent brain damage. Well, now this same situation is happening all over again with the Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19), with promised vaccines that will more than likely come with similar damaging adverse effects.As you may recall, a shocking one in 16000 people who were given the so-called Pandemrix vaccine, a product of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), were later observed to develop some combination of narcolepsy, brain damage and even death. Some individuals reportedly lost their ability to sleep for more than 90 minutes at a time, while others suddenly fell unconscious without warning. The result was that many victims ended up suing GSK, and in the United Kingdom authorities agreed to pay out the equivalent of nearly $100 million in damages. The whole thing was a major fiasco, in other words, demonstrating once again that vaccines are hardly ever what they’re cracked up to be. Fast-forward about five years and here we are again with another major disease outbreak that the government says will require a novel vaccine in order to eradicate. And just like previous ones, it probably won’t be nearly as safe or effective as health officials will one day claim. SARS-CoV vaccines were shown in studies to cause immunopathology and increased susceptibility to more disease.A 2012 study published in the journal PLoS One found that getting jabbed with SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) coronavirus vaccines can cause a person to develop pulmonary immunopathology, meaning more infection. Researchers out of Texas determined that while getting vaccinated against SARS coronavirus results in a strong antibody response, the associated “challenge” of immunopathology creates other problems that, once again, makes these “medicines” more harmful than good. “These SARS-CoV vaccines all induced antibody and protection against infection with SARS-CoV,” they concluded. “However, challenge of mice given any of the vaccines led to occurrence of Th2-type immunopathology suggesting hypersensitivity to SARS-CoV components was induced. Caution in proceeding to application of a SARS-CoV vaccine in humans is indicated.” The Polio vaccine causes polio, so just in the same way the Corona Virus is likely to cause more cases of Corona Virus. What we’re witnessing is, in many ways, a repeat of what happened during the swine flu scare. Health authorities and governments around the world created fear and panic over a novel disease in order to scare millions of people into getting a vaccine that was more dangerous than the disease itself. And just like with the Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19), taxpayers are largely footing the bill. Please sign our petition against enforced medical intervention. If you not believe that Vaccines can even cause damage, please go here to see the governements own spreadsheets on just how many people are harmed by Vaccines. Its regularly updated. So how do you protect yourself against the Coronavirus? Anyone with a healthy lifestyle, a clean diet and strong immune system should be well equipped to cope with any virus. But if you are concerned about your own immune system then please read MD Fermin’s informative and thought provoking article, stating that the medical world has much to gain from embracing Immunotherapy, such as  Genuine GcMaf. We all have GcMAF in our bodies, as it is a naturally occurring protein. The likelihood is that if you are well and healthy, you have enough of it to fight off virus’s and pathogens. If on the other hand you are sick, or have been diagnosed with a serious condition, then your immune system is low and so your GcMAF is too.\n",
      "The evidence, research and real stories that proves the effectiveness of Genuine Bulgarian GcMAF Immunotherapy, even against the rarest of cancers, is abundant. One of the issues is that it is not a well publicised story. Dr. James Lyons-Weiler, PhD, also recently published a report on his website highlighting some little-known facts about the Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19) of which you may not be aware. Included in this report is a roundup of some known nutritional and supplemental remedies that could also help you and your family stay safe from this growing pandemic.According to Dr. Theron Hutton, MD, N-acetyl cysteine, selenium, spirulina, and high-dose glucosamine are all supplements of natural origin that have been scientifically shown to provide protection against RNA viruses like influenza and coronavirus. In a paper entitled, “Nutraceuticals have potential for boosting the type 1 interferon response to RNA viruses including influenza and coronavirus,” researchers from the Catalytic Longevity Foundation and the Mid America Heart Institute at St. Luke’s Hospital found that these and other herb extractions such as elderberry possess symptomatically beneficial properties that can help to mediate the impact of infections such as coronavirus, which is definitely worth considering. Lyons-Weiler also suggests staying away from other people whenever it’s feasible to do so. While avoiding people entirely is next to impossible, especially if you live in an urban or semi-urban environment that necessitates going out to buy groceries and other necessities on a regular basis, you can take basic steps such as not sharing food containers or utensils and avoiding medical facilities.THE NEW CORONAVIRUS VACCINE COULD BE MORE DAMAGING THAN THE DISEASE ITSELF\n",

      "Infection with SARS-CoV-2 is associated with respiratory tissue damage that can impair lung function and even cause death. Though it is likely that both the virus and immune system contribute to this process, it can be difficult to determine which mechanism causes the most damage.To establish infection, a virus must enter a host cell. Once inside, it hijacks the cell’s machinery to replicate, eventually killing the cell and releasing more virus. This process not only damages host tissues, but also potently activates the immune system. The immune system in turn unleashes powerful weapons to control the infection. However, if not carefully regulated, the immune response itself can cause collateral damage to host tissues and exacerbate disease severity.More research on the host and viral factors that contribute to severe COVID-19 disease and death could provide important clues for clinicians and researchers in the search for new treatments.Does an overreaction by the immune system play a role in COVID-19 deaths, or are they caused strictly by damage inflicted by the virus itself?\n",

In some people with COVID-19, the immune system releases immune messengers, called cytokines, into the bloodstream out of proportion to the threat or long after the virus is no longer a threat.When this happens, the immune system attacks the body's own tissues, potentially causing significant harm. A cytokine storm triggers an exaggerated inflammatory response that may damage the liver, blood vessels, kidneys, and lungs, and increase formation of blood clots throughout the body. Ultimately, the cytokine storm may cause more harm than the coronavirus itself.A simple blood test can help determine whether someone with COVID-19 may be experiencing a cytokine storm.

      "Over 86500 people have reportedly died in the United States from the Coronavirus, and the fear generated by those deaths is driving the public policy debate. But that number is a dramatic overcount. Our metrics include deaths that have nothing to do with the virus. The problem is even worse as the Centers for Disease Control over counts even some of these cases and the government has created financial incentives for this misreporting. Relying on these flawed numbers is destroying businesses and jobs and costing lives.“The case definition is very simplistic,” Dr. Ngozi Ezike, director of Illinois Department of Public Health, explains. “It means, at the time of death, it was a COVID positive diagnosis. That means, that if you were in hospice and had already been given a few weeks to live, and then you also were found to have COVID, that would be counted as a COVID death. It means, technically even if you died of clear alternative cause, but you had COVID at the same time, it’s still listed as a COVID death.”Medical examiners in Michigan use the same definition. In Macomb and Oakland Counties, where most of the deaths occurred, medical examiners classify any deaths as Coronavirus deaths when the postmortem test is positive. Even people who died in suicides and automobile accidents meet that definition.\n",
      "Still, these broad definitions are not due to a few rogue public health officials. The rules direct them to do this. Unlike other countries,“if someone dies with COVID-19, we are counting that as a COVID-19 death,” as Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, recently noted.Classifications go beyond even these broad categories. New York is classifying cases as Coronavirus deaths even when postmortem tests have been negative. Despite negative tests, classifications are based on symptoms, even though the symptoms are often very similar to those of the seasonal flu. The Centers for Disease Control guidance explicitly acknowledges the uncertainty that doctors can face. When Coronavirus cases are “suspected,” they advise doctors that “it is acceptable to report COVID-19 on a death certificate.”That isn’t just a theoretical issue. On April 21st, when New York City’s death toll rose above 10000, the New York Times reported that the city included “3700 additional people who were presumed to have died of the coronavirus but had never tested positive” – a more than 50 percent increase in the number of cases.But the problem is worse than this broad definition implies. Birx and others believe that the CDC is over counting cases. The Washington Post reports they are concerned that the CDC’s “antiquated” accounting system is double counting cases and inflating mortality and case counts “by as much as 25 percent.”\n",
      "There are additional reasons for concern. Some doctors feel pressure from hospitals to list deaths as due to the Coronavirus, even when they don’t believe that is the case, “to make it look a little bit worse than it is.” There are financial incentives that might make a difference for hospitals and doctors. The CARES Act adds a 20 percent premium for COVID-19 Medicare patients.Incentives matter. When the government increased the disability compensation for air traffic controllers, a lot more controllers suddenly started claiming to be disabled. When unemployment insurance payments increase, more people become unemployed and stay unemployed for longer periods. When the government offers flood insurance that charges everyone the same insurance premium regardless of the risk level in their area, more people build homes in frequently flooded areas.The Washington Post and others claim that we are undercounting the true number of deaths. They reach that conclusion by showing the total number of deaths from all causes is greater than we would normally expect from March through early May, and that this excess is actually due to deaths not being accurately labeled as due to the Coronavirus. But these are simply not normal times. Lots of people with heart and other problems aren’t going to the hospital for fear of the virus. Surgeries for many serious conditions are being put off. The stress of the situation is increasing suicides and other illnesses.Deaths that have absolutely nothing to do with the Coronavirus count as virus deaths. Add to that claims that the CDC is double counting some of these improperly identified cases and the perverse financial incentives created by the government, and you have a real mess when crucial decisions are being made based in large part on this data.Erroneous data unduly scare people about the risks of the disease. It keeps the country locked down longer than necessary, which destroys peoples’ lives and livelihoods in many other ways. Exaggerated fears of the virus endanger lives by keeping people from obtaining treatment for other medical problems.  It also makes it impossible to accurately compare policies across countries.It is hard to believe that we are basing such crucial decisions on such flawed data.The US Is Dramatically Overcounting Coronavirus Deaths.

      "Today, the Commission offered up to €80 million of financial support to CureVac, a higly innovative vaccine developer from Tübingen, Germany, to scale up development and production of a vaccine against the Coronavirus in Europe. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, Mariya Gabriel, discussed with the CureVac management via videoconference. The Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), Ambroise Fayolle, also participated. The support would come in form of an EU guarantee of a currently assessed EIB loan of an identical amount, in the framework of the InnovFin Infectious Disease Finance Facility under Horizon 2020. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said: “In this public health crisis it is of utmost importance that we support our leading researchers and tech companies. We are determined to provide CureVac with the financing it needs to quickly scale up development and production of a vaccine against the Coronavirus. I am proud that we have leading companies like CureVac in the EU. Their home is here. But their vaccines will benefit everyone, in Europe and beyond.” Mariya Gabriel, Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, said: “Supporting excellent EU research and innovation is an essential part of our coordinated response against the spread of the Coronavirus. In 2014, CureVac won EU's first ever innovation inducement prize. We are committed to support further its EU-based research and innovation in these critical times. Science and innovation in Europe are at the heart of our policies for protecting people's health.” Ambroise Fayolle, Vice-President for Innovation in the European Investment Bank, said: “The EIB is and remains the EU Bank for innovation, even more than ever in the current health crisis. Thanks to our strong and fruitful long partnership with the Commission in the area of research and innovation financial instruments (InnovFin), we are determined to do our best to support CureVac scale up needs for the benefits of EU citizen and beyond.” Founded in 2000, CureVac is a German biopharmaceutical company that has developed a novel technology to overcome one of the biggest barriers to using vaccines: the need to keep them stable without refrigeration. Its vaccine technology is based on messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules that stimulate the immune system. Preliminary studies have shown that the technology holds a promise for rapid response to COVID-19. If proven, millions of vaccine doses could potentially be produced at low costs in existing CureVac production facilities. CureVac has already started its COVID-19 vaccine development program and estimates to launch clinical testing by June 2020. The Commission recognised CureVac's potential to bring life-saving vaccines to people across the planet in safe and affordable ways already in 2014 when CureVac received the first ever EU innovation inducement prize of €2 million, funded by the EU's research and innovation programme, FP7. The award was intended to support further development of the breakthrough idea. Now the Commission and the EIB are strengthening jointly their efforts to provide the necessary means to CureVac, taking advantage of their long and fruitful cooperation in financial instruments dedicated to support research and innovation such as Horizon 2020 InnovFin and in particular its Infectious Disease Finance Facility. Background The support to CureVac is part of coordinated EU response to the public health threat of COVID-19. Working closely with the industry, the Commission has mobilised up to €140 million in public and private funding to support urgently needed research. On 6 March, the Commission announced that it selected 17 projects involving 136 research teams to receive a total funding of €47.5 million from its research and innovation programme, Horizon 2020. The teams will work on developing vaccines, new treatments, diagnostic tests and medical systems aimed at preventing the spread of the Coronavirus. In addition, the Commission has committed up to €45 million for research on vaccines and treatments through a call published on 3 March by the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI), which is to be matched by the pharma industry, so up to €90 million in all. In the past years the European Commission has invested greatly in research to prepare exactly for this type of public health emergency.

      "Over the past week, novel coronavirus has dominated headlines as the infection continues to spread both in China and abroad. And it wasn’t even days into the crisis that several entities, including Novavax, announced that they’re already feverishly working on new vaccines for the disease.The company recently announced that, because of its extensive history working with other types of coronavirus, including both M.E.R.S. and S.A.R.S., it has what it takes to tackle this one with ease.“Using Novavax’ recombinant nanoparticle vaccine technology, the company expects to develop a vaccine candidate from the genetic sequence of the Wuhan coronavirus,” Novavax announced in a statement.The news caused an almost instantaneous spike in Novavax’s share value, which surged an astounding 60 percent that same day.Since that time, numerous other vaccine manufacturers have announced that they, too, are planning to develop their own vaccines for coronavirus.One of these is Johnson & Johnson (J&J), which is facing a criminal investigation over the presence of toxic asbestos in its talc-based baby powder products.The biotech firms Inovio Pharmaceuticals and Moderna are also entering the fray of trying to develop their own respective vaccines for this emerging viral threat, which as of this writing has infected nearly 10000 people and killed at least 213 others, according to the official numbers.Guess who’s paying, at least in part, for these up-and-coming coronavirus vaccines? Taxpayers!Since it’s expensive to do this, especially for outbreaks that come and go – and perhaps never come back – each of these companies is reportedly relying on funding from non-profit groups as well as the government – meaning taxpayers.Moderna, for instance, is receiving cash from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (N.I.A.I.D.), as well as from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, a nongovernmental organization (N.G.O.) funded by governments and private foundations.“We are leveraging not our shareholders’ capital, but not-for-profit capital, in a way that’s nondilutive to the rest of our efforts,” says Tal Zaks, Moderna’s chief medical officer.Scientists in China are also working on a coronavirus vaccine, and are currently in the process of investigating how monoclonal antibodies, which were first developed for S.A.R.S, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, might be reused to develop vaccines and antiviral drugs for novel coronavirus.\n",
      "These scientists have reportedly discovered an antibody that can be bound to the surface of novel coronavirus, also known as 2019-nCoV, in order to neutralize it, which they hope will be able to tackle the disease sooner rather than later.For more related news about Big Pharma, be sure to check out BigPharma.Fetch.news.But wait: Doesn’t it take a LONG time to bring a new vaccine to market?The problem with trying to address outbreaks such as this one the conventional way – with vaccines and pharmaceuticals, rather than natural remedies like oregano oil – is that there’s a lengthy process for bringing drugs and jabs to market.\n",
      "What this means is that none of this will be ready in time for the current outbreak – that is, unless pharmaceuticals and vaccines for novel coronavirus are rushed to market, as some reports are already indicating.Clinical trials for one of the first vaccines are reportedly set for three months from now, the locations of which are yet to be determined.“It took scientists 20 months to develop a S.A.R.S. vaccine to test on humans, but the N.I.H.

      "The EU’s initial response to the massive outbreak of coronavirus in Italy was largely “inadequate,” and a lack of European solidarity opened the doors for Russia and China, former Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini told RT.The new epicenter of the dreaded pandemic, Italy, has been struggling to stop the spread of Covid-19 for weeks now. The disease has already killed more than six thousand people in the country, with over 60 thousand people infected.EU tried to pin the blame on Italy.The EU clearly underestimated the virus, blaming the outbreak in Italy on its national healthcare system flaws, according to the two-time foreign minister and OSCE representative. As a result, Brussels, which preaches pan-European solidarity, failed to act when this solidarity was needed in the face of a crisis that eventually affected the entire bloc.Frankly speaking, Brussels is not doing enough. At the very first moment, Italy was practically alone against the virus. Many said it was all because of the Italian habits, because Italians do not respect the rules. Suddenly, they realized all the other countries were equally affected.The situation in other major EU states like Germany and France deteriorated rapidly, forcing them to deal with thousands of infected on their own soil.“Everyone just focused on the situation at home before even thinking about helping others,” Andrea Giannotti, the executive director of the Italian Institute of Eurasian Studies, told RT.The lack of solidarity was recently noted from outside of the bloc – Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic decried European solidarity as a myth, while praising Beijing for its assistance. His remarks came after Serbia received five million masks from China, which it could not get in Europe.\n",
      "The EU is now trying “to do more” and somehow “make up” for its initial poor execution of a coordinated response, former Italian MP Dario Rivolta said.\n",
      "Brussels has indeed ramped up its efforts, suspending the bloc’s strict Stability and Growth Pact regulating budgetary policy among others. Frattini particularly hailed this decision, which allows Rome to act freely in terms of budgetary spending, as “very important.” But this came only after Europe “realized its [measures] were inadequate to give a united response.”Still, it is not enough, Rivolta told RT, adding that “for the moment,” there are no major changes. And while financial relief is necessary, there are other things to be considered, such as medical assistance.“As for the medical aspects, the only thing that the EU did up to now was to put barriers between Italy and other countries.”Huge support in terms of expertise. At one point, requests for help were sent out all over the world, according to Giannotti.“Some Italian embassies were tasked with negotiating with local governments in order to find any opportunities to receive assistance from abroad, including help with equipment, which Italy lacks.” Russia and China were among those who responded. In total, Moscow prepared nine cargo planes with emergency aid, delivering vital medical equipment and supplies, as well as bringing experienced specialists in infectious diseases and military doctors to Italy. Now they will be deployed to the most affected regions in the country’s north.Frattini said the help was of the utmost importance: “What Russia has done is not comparable to what other countries have done, including China because China also sent something but not comparable with the support provided by Russia.”The specialists have provided “very huge support in terms of expertise… in terms of virology.”  The assistance serves as a gesture of solidarity in times of European sanctions on Moscow and the counter-measures, Giannotti said. Sending help “despite [the fact] the situation in Russia itself may also worsen” means it is a clear message that Moscow is ready to talk and settle issues with Europe when there is a greater need for cooperation.Speaking to RT, the Italian ambassador to Russia, Pasquale Terracciano, agreed that a joint approach is the best way to put an end to the pandemic.Thanking Moscow for the contribution, he said: “It will be crucial to recover from this tragic situation, hopefully soon.”EU left Italy ‘practically alone' to fight coronavirus, so Rome looked for help elsewhere, incl Russia – ex-FM Frattini to RT\n",

      "A serologic test is a blood test that looks for antibodies created by your immune system. There are many reasons you might make antibodies, the most important of which is to help fight infections. The serologic test for COVID-19 specifically looks for antibodies against the COVID-19 virus.Your body takes at least five to 10 days after you have acquired the infection to develop antibodies to this virus. For this reason, serologic tests are not sensitive enough to accurately diagnose an active COVID-19 infection, even in people with symptoms.However, serologic tests can help identify anyone who has recovered from coronavirus. This may include people who were not initially identified as having COVID-19 because they had no symptoms, had mild symptoms, chose not to get tested, had a false-negative test, or could not get tested for any reason. Serologic tests will provide a more accurate picture of how many people have been infected with, and recovered from, coronavirus, as well as the true fatality rate.Serologic tests may also provide information about whether people become immune to coronavirus once they've recovered and, if so, how long that immunity lasts. In time, these tests may be used to determine who can safely go back out into the community.Scientists can also study coronavirus antibodies to learn which parts of the coronavirus the immune system responds to, in turn giving them clues about which part of the virus to target in vaccines they are developing.Serological tests are starting to become available and are being developed by many private companies worldwide. However, the accuracy of these tests needs to be validated before widespread use in the US.What is serologic (antibody) testing for COVID-19? What can it be used for?\n",

      "April 11 Update: A new research study reveals that COVID-19 attacks hemoglobin in red blood cells, rendering it incapable of transporting oxygen. In the conclusion, researchers found that chloroquine could prevent the virus attacking the hemoglobin in the red blood cells.Last Wednesday, we published the success story from Dr. Vladimir Zelenko, a board-certified family practitioner in New York, after he successfully treated 350 coronavirus patients with 100 percent success using a cocktail of drugs: hydroxychloroquine, in combination with azithromycin (Z-Pak), an antibiotic to treat secondary infections, and zinc sulfate.  Dr. Zelenko said he saw the symptom of shortness of breath resolved within four to six hours after treatment. Hydroxychloroquine is now being used worldwide, according to a map from French Dr. Didier Raoult.  In the meantime, scientists at University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine believe they’ve found potential vaccine for coronavirus.Now, Dr. Zelenko provides updates on the treatment after he successfully treated 699 COVID-19 patients in New York. In an exclusive interview with former New York Mayor, Rudy Giuliani, Dr. Vladmir Zelenko shares the results of his latest study, which showed that out of his 699 patients treated, zero patients died, zero patients intubated, and four hospitalizations.Dr. Zelenko said the whole treatment costs only $20 over a period of 5 days with 100% success. He defines success as “Not to die.” Dr. Zelenko first posted his Facebook video message last week calling on President Trump to “advise the country that they should be taking this medication.”There are many other success stories about hydroxychloroquine across the country. Last week, Dr. William Grace, an oncologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, said they’ve not had a single death in their hospital because of  hydroxychloroquine. “Thanks to hydroxychloroquine, we have not had a death in our hospital,’ Dr. Grace said.Also, in a study conducted by the National Institute of Health (NIH) also confirmed some of Dr. Dr. Zelenko’s findings. The study by NIH showed that Zinc supplementation decreases the morbidity of lower respiratory tract infection in pediatric patients in the developing world. A second study also conducted by NIH titled: “In Vitro Antiviral Activity and Projection of Optimized Dosing Design of Hydroxychloroquine for the Treatment of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),” also showed hydroxychloroquine to be more potent in killing the virus off in vitro (in the test tube and not in the body).Below is a video of his latest interview explaining the success of the treatment.Dr. Vladimir Zelenko has now treated 699 coronavirus patients with 100% success using Hydroxychloroquine Sulfate, Zinc and Z-Pak\n",

      "The emergence and outbreak of a newly discovered acute respiratory disease in Wuhan, China, has affected greater than 40000 people, and killed more than 1000 as of Feb. 10, 2020. A new human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was quickly identified, and the associated disease is now referred to as coronavirus disease discovered in 2019 (COVID-19) (https://globalbiodefense.com/novel-coronavirus-covid-19-portal/).According to what has been reported [1–3], COVID-2019 seems to have similar clinical manifestations to that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV. The SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence also has ∼80% identity with SARS-CoV, but it is most similar to some bat beta-coronaviruses, with the highest being >96% identity.Currently, there are speculations, rumours and conspiracy theories that SARS-CoV-2 is of laboratory origin. Some people have alleged that the human SARS-CoV-2 was leaked directly from a laboratory in Wuhan where a bat CoV (RaTG13) was recently reported, which shared ∼96% homology with the SARS-CoV-2 [4]. However, as we know, the human SARS-CoV and intermediate host palm civet SARS-like CoV shared 99.8% homology, with a total of 202 single-nucleotide (nt) variations (SNVs) identified across the genome [6]. Given that there are greater than 1100 nt differences between the human SARS-CoV-2 and the bat RaTG13-CoV [4], which are distributed throughout the genome in a naturally occurring pattern following the evolutionary characteristics typical of CoVs, it is highly unlikely that RaTG13 CoV is the immediate source of SARS-CoV-2. The absence of a logical targeted pattern in the new viral sequences and a close relative in a wildlife species (bats) are the most revealing signs that SARS-CoV-2 evolved by natural evolution. A search for an intermediate animal host between bats and humans is needed to identify animal CoVs more closely related to human SARS-CoV-2. There is speculation that pangolins might carry CoVs closely related to SARS-CoV-2, but the data to substantiate this is not yet published (https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00364-2).Another claim in Chinese social media points to a Nature Medicine paper published in 2015 [7], which reports the construction of a chimeric CoV with a bat CoV S gene (SHC014) in the backbone of a SARS CoV that has adapted to infect mice (MA15) and is capable of infecting human cells [8]. However, this claim lacks any scientific basis and must be discounted because of significant divergence in the genetic sequence of this construct with the new SARS-CoV-2 (>5000 nucleotides).\n",
      "The mouse-adapted SARS virus (MA15) [9] was generated by serial passage of an infectious wildtype SARS CoV clone in the respiratory tract of BALB/c mice. After 15 passages in mice, the SARS-CoV gained elevated replication and lung pathogenesis in aged mice (hence M15), due to six coding genetic mutations associated with mouse adaptation. It is likely that MA15 is highly attenuated to replicate in human cells or patients due to the mouse adaptation.It was proposed that the S gene from bat-derived CoV, unlike that from human patients- or civets-derived viruses, was unable to use human ACE2 as a receptor for entry into human cells [1011]. Civets were proposed to be an intermediate host of the bat-CoVs, capable of spreading SARS CoV to humans [612]. However, in 2013 several novel bat coronaviruses were isolated from Chinese horseshoe bats and the bat SARS-like or SL-CoV-WIV1 was able to use ACE2 from humans, civets and Chinese horseshoe bats for entry [8]. Combined with evolutionary evidence that the bat ACE2 gene has been positively selected at the same contact sites as the human ACE2 gene for interacting with SARS CoV [13], it was proposed that an intermediate host may not be necessary and that some bat SL-CoVs may be able to directly infect human hosts. To directly address this possibility, the exact S gene from bat coronavirus SL-SHC014 was synthesized and used to generate a chimeric virus in the mouse adapted MA15 SARS-CoV backbone. The resultant SL-SHC014-MA15 virus could indeed efficiently use human ACE2 and replicate in primary human airway cells to similar titres as epidemic strains of SARS-CoV. While SL-SHC014-MA15 can replicate efficiently in young and aged mouse lungs, infection was attenuated, and less virus antigen was present in the airway epithelium as compared to SARS MA15, which causes lethal outcomes in aged mice [7].\n",
      "Due to the elevated pathogenic activity of the SHC014-MA15 chimeric virus relative to MA15 chimeric virus with the original human SARS S gene in mice, such experiments with SL-SHC014-MA15 chimeric virus were later restricted as gain of function (GOF) studies under the US government-mandated pause policy (https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/who-we-are/nih-director/statements/nih-lifts-funding-pause-gain-function-research). The current COVID-2019 epidemic has restarted the debate over the risks of constructing such viruses that could have pandemic potential, irrespective of the finding that these bat CoVs already exist in nature. Regardless, upon careful phylogenetic analyses by multiple international groups [514], the SARS-CoV-2 is undoubtedly distinct from SL-SHC014-MA15, with >6000 nucleotide differences across the whole genome. Therefore, once again there is no credible evidence to support the claim that the SARS-CoV-2 is derived from the chimeric SL-SHC014-MA15 virus.There are also rumours that the SARS-CoV-2 was artificially, or intentionally, made by humans in the lab, and this is highlighted in one manuscript submitted to BioRxiv (a manuscript sharing site prior to any peer review), claiming that SARS-CoV-2 has HIV sequence in it and was thus likely generated in the laboratory. In a rebuttal paper led by an HIV-1 virologist Dr. Feng Gao, they used careful bioinformatics analyses to demonstrate that the original claim of multiple HIV insertions into the SARS-CoV-2 is not HIV-1 specific but random [15]. Because of the many concerns raised by the international community, the authors who made the initial claim have already withdrawn this report.Evolution is stepwise and accrues mutations gradually over time, whereas synthetic constructs would typically use a known backbone and introduce logical or targeted changes instead of the randomly occurring mutations that are present in naturally isolated viruses such as bat CoV RaTG13. In our view, there is currently no credible evidence to support the claim that SARS-CoV-2 originated from a laboratory-engineered CoV. It is more likely that SARS-CoV-2 is a recombinant CoV generated in nature between a bat CoV and another coronavirus in an intermediate animal host. More studies are needed to explore this possibility and resolve the natural origin of SARS-CoV-2. We should emphasize that, although SARS-CoV-2 shows no evidence of laboratory origin, viruses with such great public health threats must be handled properly in the laboratory and also properly regulated by the scientific community and governments.No credible evidence supporting claims of the laboratory engineering of SARS-CoV-2\n",

If you get vaccinated, you might become infected with the virus.\" Some vaccines do contain a version of the virus that has been weakened, but it will not give you the disease it's vaccinating against. The CDC clearly describes how vaccination works here . The CDC explains: “Vaccines help develop immunity by imitating an infection. This type of infection, however, almost never causes illness, but it does cause the immune system to produce T-lymphocytes and antibodies. Sometimes, after getting a vaccine, the imitation infection can cause minor symptoms, such as fever. Such minor symptoms are normal and should be expected as the body builds immunity.” There are multiple types of vaccines. Some – not all – vaccines use parts of a virus to strengthen the immune system to it, and this is done in a medical, scientific process (see here). Safe vaccines pass many stages before becoming available to the public, see more on this here. VERDICT. False: The coronavirus is not designed, Bill Gates did not patent COVID-19 and there is still no vaccine.

      "Bill Gates says the U.S. government is falling short in preparing the nation and the world for the “significant probability of a large and lethal modern-day pandemic occurring in our lifetimes.”In an interview this week, the billionaire philanthropist said he has raised the issue of pandemic preparedness with President Trump since the 2016 presidential election. In his most recent meeting last month, Gates said he laid out the increasing risk of a bioterrorism attack and stressed the importance of U.S. funding for advanced research on new therapeutics, including a universal flu vaccine, which would protect against all or most strains of influenza.Gates, who co-founded Microsoft and now leads a foundation on global health, said he told Trump that the president has a chance to lead on the issue of global health security. Trump encouraged him to follow up with top officials at the Health and Human Services Department, the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration, Gates said.Gates said he met several times with H.R. McMaster, the president’s former national security adviser, and hopes to meet with McMaster’s replacement, John Bolton. The National Security Council, Gates said, is an appropriate office to “show leadership on this issue and decide how to coordinate the various groups” within the government.“But, you know, I think we’ve got to push this ... with the executive branch and Congress quite a bit,” Gates said. “There hasn’t been a big effort along these lines.”His interview with The Washington Post preceded a speech — on the challenges associated with modern epidemics — that Gates gave Friday before the Massachusetts Medical Society.Gates and his wife, Melinda, have repeatedly warned that a pandemic is the greatest immediate threat to humanity. Experts say the risk is high, because new pathogens are constantly emerging and the world is so interconnected.Many experts agree that the United States remains underprepared for a pandemic or a bioterrorism threat. The government’s sprawling bureaucracy, they say, is not nimble enough to deal with mutations that suddenly turn an influenza virus into a particularly virulent strain, as the 1918 influenza did in killing an estimated 50 million to 100 million people worldwide.Even this winter’s harsh seasonal flu was enough to overwhelm some hospitals, forcing them to pitch tents outside emergency rooms to cope with the crush of patients.If a highly contagious and lethal airborne pathogen like the 1918 influenza were to take hold today, nearly 33 million people worldwide would die in just six months, Gates noted in his prepared remarks, citing a simulation done by the Institute for Disease Modeling, a research organization in Bellevue, Wash.In those remarks, Gates highlighted scientific and technical advances in the development of better vaccines, drugs and diagnostics that he said could revolutionize preparation for and treatment of infectious diseases. He praised last year’s formation of a new global coalition, known as CEPI, to create new vaccines for emerging infectious diseases. He also announced a $12 million Grand Challenge in partnership with the family of Google Inc. co-founder Larry Page to accelerate the development of a universal flu vaccine.But vaccines, he noted, take time to research, deploy and generate protective immunity.“So we need to invest in other approaches, like antiviral drugs and antibody therapies that can be stockpiled or rapidly manufactured to stop the spread of pandemic diseases or treat people who have been exposed,” he said in his speech.Among the advances in these areas are a new influenza antiviral recently approved in Japan that Gates said “stops the virus in its tracks” by inhibiting an enzyme it needs to multiply; research on antibodies that could protect against a pandemic strain of a virus; and a diagnostic test that harnesses the powerful genetic-engineering technology known as CRISPR and has the field-use potential to check a patient’s blood, saliva or urine for evidence of multiple pathogens. That test could, for example, identify whether someone is infected with Zika or dengue virus, which have similar symptoms.But even the best tools in the world won’t be sufficient, Gates said, if the United States doesn’t have a strategy to harness and coordinate resources at home and help to lead an effective global preparedness and response system.Trump and senior administration officials have affirmed the importance of controlling infectious disease outbreaks. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is facing a loss of emergency funding provided in the wake of the 2014 Ebola epidemic and has begun to planning to downsize its epidemic-prevention activities in 39 out of 49 countries where disease risks are greatest.Congress provided additional funding in last month’s spending bill. But it also directed the administration to come up with a comprehensive plan to strengthen global health security at home and abroad.“This could be an important first step if the White House and Congress use the opportunity to articulate and embrace a leadership role for the U.S.,” Gates said in the speech.No other country, he noted, has the depth of scientific or technical expertise that the United States possesses, drawing on the resources of institutions such as NIH, CDC and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, as well as the Defense Department's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.Bill Gates calls on U.S. to lead fight against a pandemic that could kill 33 million\n",

The immune system can develop antibodies that latch onto spike proteins and stop the virus.A successful vaccine for the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus would teach people’s immune systems to make antibodies against the virus without causing disease.Whole-Virus Vaccines.Vaccines that modify the entire coronavirus to provoke an immune response.Inactivated and Live Attenuated Vaccines.Most vaccines in use today incorporate an inactivated or weakened form of a virus that is not able to cause disease. When immune cells encounter them, they make antibodies.Making these vaccines means growing viruses — and lots of them. Influenza vaccines are typically grown in chicken eggs, and other vaccines are grown in tanks full of floating cells. These procedures can take months to produce a batch of new vaccines.EXAMPLES: Conventional vaccines for influenza, chickenpox, measles, mumps and rubella all fall into this category.COMPANIES DEVELOPING SARS-COV-2 VACCINES: Sinovac and others.Genetic Vaccines.Vaccines that use part of the coronavirus’s genetic code.DNA Vaccines.A number of experimental coronavirus vaccines don’t deliver whole viruses. Instead, they deliver genetic instructions for building a viral protein. The protein can then stimulate the immune system to make antibodies and help mount other defenses against the coronavirus.One of these genetic approaches is known as a DNA vaccine. A circle of engineered DNA is delivered into cells. The cells read the viral gene, make a copy in a molecule called messenger RNA, and then use the mRNA to assemble viral proteins. The immune system detects the proteins and mounts defenses.Prototype DNA vaccines based on the spike protein protected monkeys from the coronavirus.EXAMPLES: DNA vaccines have been approved for veterinary cases such as canine melanoma and West Nile virus in horses. There are no approved DNA vaccines for use in humans, but researchers are running trials to see if they might be effective for diseases such as Zika and the flu.COMPANIES: Inovio and others.RNA Vaccines. Some researchers want to skip DNA and instead deliver messenger RNA into cells. The cells read the mRNA and make spike proteins that provoke an immune response.The biotech company Moderna recently completed a small safety trial with eight volunteers that showed promising early results against the coronavirus.\n",
      "Both RNA and DNA vaccines can be produced more quickly than traditional methods.EXAMPLES: There are no approved RNA vaccines, but they are in clinical trials for MERS and other diseases.Viral Vector Vaccines. Vaccines that use a virus to deliver coronavirus genes into cells.Vaccines Using Adenovirus or Other Viruses\n",
      "Viruses are very good at getting into cells. Since the 1990s, researchers have been investigating how to use them to deliver genes into cells to immunize people against diseases.To create a coronavirus vaccine, several teams have added the spike protein gene to a virus called an adenovirus. The adenovirus slips into cells and unloads the gene. Because the adenovirus is missing one of its own genes, it cannot replicate and is therefore safe.EXAMPLES: Several virus vector vaccines are used to vaccinate animals against rabies and distemper. Johnson & Johnson has developed H.I.V. and Ebola vaccines using an adenovirus. Both have proven safe in humans and are now in efficacy trials.Protein-Based Vaccines.Vaccines that use a coronavirus protein or a protein fragment.Virus-Like Particle Vaccines.Some vaccines are particles that contain pieces of viral proteins. They can’t cause disease because they are not actual viruses, but they can still show the immune system what coronavirus proteins look like.EXAMPLES: The vaccine for HPV falls into this category.COMPANIES: Medicago, Doherty Institute and others.Recombinant Vaccines.Yeast or other cells can be engineered to carry a virus’s gene and spew out viral proteins, which are then harvested and put into a vaccine. A coronavirus vaccine of this design would contain whole spike proteins or small pieces of the protein.EXAMPLES: This category includes some vaccines for shingles and hepatitis B.COMPANIES: Novavax and others.Different Approaches to a Coronavirus Vaccine\n",

      "Clinical manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are rare or absent in children and adolescents; hence, early clinical detection is fundamental to prevent further spreading. We report three young patients presenting with chilblain-like lesions who were diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Two of them were asymptomatic and potentially contagious. Skin lesions, such as erythematous rashes, urticaria, and chicken pox-like vesicles, were reported in 18 (20·4%) of 88 patients with COVID-19 in a previous study.3 These symptoms developed at the onset of SARS-CoV-2 infection or during hospital stay and did not correlate with disease severity.3 In our cases, lesions involved the acral sites, especially the dorsum of the digits of the feet, beginning as erythematous-violaceous patches that slowly evolved to purpuric lesions and then to blisters and ulceronecrotic lesions, with final complete return to normal. Burning and itching were also present with some of the lesions. Informed consent was obtained from the parents of patients 1 and 2 and from patient 3 himself.Patient 1 was a 14-year-old boy who presented to the hospital with erythematous-violaceous lesions involving the dorsum of all digits of both feet. After 7 days, a few red macules and papules appeared on the lateral and plantar aspect of both feet and a small ulcer developed on the fifth digit of the left foot (figure). Because a family member had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the patient underwent nasopharyngeal swab and was found positive for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR. The lesions disappeared in the following 7 days.Patient 2 was a 14-year-old boy with no known contact with COVID-19 cases who had been asymptomatic since the beginning of the skin disease, for which his parents requested a teledermatology consultation. Manifestations consisted of small erythematous-violaceous lesions on the dorsum of almost all digits of the feet, some of which were characterised by necrotic aspects with blackish crusts (appendix). The lesions lasted 20 days, with complete healing. Nasopharyngeal swab taken by the family's paediatrician 2 days after the skin manifestations appeared was positive for SARS-CoV-2.Patient 3 was an 18-year-old boy whose grandfather had COVID-19 pneumonia. After 2 days with fever (38·5°C), the boy reported the appearance of chilblain-like lesions involving the distal part of all digits of the feet (appendix). Skin manifestations remained unchanged for 10 days, suddenly disappearing without treatment. Nasopharyngeal swab taken 4 days after the skin manifestations appeared was positive. The patient was otherwise asymptomatic.\n",

      "Ebola, SARS, swine flu, MERS. With the reality that a previously unknown animal virus has started infecting people, the world faces a recurring question: What does one call it? The pneumonia-causing virus, which is spreading rapidly in China and beyond, is currently being identified as 2019-nCoV, shorthand for a novel or new (i.e. “n”) coronavirus (CoV) that was first detected in 2019. The disease it causes doesn’t yet have a name, either, though Wuhan SARS or Wu Flu are among of the options being thrown around on the internet. None of these is likely to be the virus’ or the disease’s permanent name. They almost certainly would be unacceptable to the Chinese, and to the World Health Organization, which discourages the use of place names in the naming of diseases. As for the virus, the longer it spreads the less novel it becomes. 2019-nCoV is a bit like calling a daughter “the girl born in 2019.” Given that another daughter might be born in 2021, a name that might more easily distinguish between the two is probably in order. So how to name it? And who gets to name it? So how to name it? And who gets to name it? Traditionally naming rights actually belong to the scientists who first isolate a virus, who will at some point propose a name to a study group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, said Ralph Baric, a coronavirus expert who sits on that panel. That group’s next scheduled meeting is in May. It’s possible the WHO could work in conjunction with the committee to name the new virus. Ron Fouchier, a Dutch virologist who knows a thing or two about virus naming controversies, said he contacted the former chair of the coronavirus study group on Wednesday and urged him to start the process of coming up with a workable name sooner rather than later. “If nobody steps in quick, then I think that the name the lay press is going to give it is probably what’s going to fly,” Fouchier told STAT.That might mean this virus and disease become known by the name of the city currently quarantined to stop the virus’s spread, Wuhan. “NCoV is not going to fly for long,” Fouchier said. “And if they don’t do it in an authoritative way, then other people will come up with a name.” It was the WHO that chose the name SARS and was involved in the negotiations that settled on the name MERS — though WHO now uses MERS as an example of what not to do when naming a disease since it evokes a specific region. (The acronym is short for Middle East respiratory syndrome.) That, experts now agree, can be seen as disparaging. The scientists who investigated the first known Ebola outbreak were aware of the risk of leaving an indelible stain on a particular place. That team, led by legendary virus hunter Karl Johnson, traveled to Yambuku, in what was then Zaire — now the Democratic Republic of the Congo — in 1976 to try to determine what was killing people who worked in or sought care at a hospital run by Belgian nuns. Johnson proposed that the virus be called Ebola, after a river he spotted on a map, roughly 40 miles away from where the outbreak was taking place, according to a report of the outbreak response, published in 2016. Yambuku was spared the infamy of being the name of a highly deadly virus. In the case of what is now known as SARS, officials at the WHO moved early to name the new disease. The global health agency alerted the world to the fact a new virus was spreading from China on Wednesday, March 12, 2003. By Saturday, the disease had a name. “The reason we named it was we didn’t want the press or some other group to name it with a stigmatizing name,’’ said Dr. David Heymann, who led the WHO’s SARS response and who was one of a small group of people who came up with the name. Heymann, who is now a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said they wanted an easy-to-say acronym, like AIDS or HIV, that would also be easy to remember. They decided on words that described the condition, formed an acronym, and didn’t — or so they thought at the time — label any area as the source of the virus. Severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, was born. It was only later that the similarity to Hong Kong’s status as an SAR — special administrative region — within China was recognized. Hong Kong suffered mightily from SARS and did not appreciate the fact that the virus, which originated in China, appeared to hint at a Hong Kong origin. Likewise the naming of MERS created bad blood when a new coronavirus that jumped from camels to people emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012. When the virus was first isolated at Erasmus University in Rotterdam, in the Netherlands, it was called HCoV-KSA1, for human coronavirus from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The kingdom — which was already mad that a specimen from a sick Saudi had been shipped to the Netherlands without its knowledge — got madder. Fouchier, who led the work to isolate the virus, recalled the Dutch team then tried EMC1, thinking it could name the pathogen after Erasmus Medical Center. The Saudis were still not happy. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, the Saudi Arabian government, and the WHO eventually negotiated the issue and settled on MERS. Since then, the WHO has published guidance on the naming of new human diseases. Don’t name them after countries or regions. Don’t name them after people. Don’t name them after the animals they come from — the swine flu pandemic of 2009 was quickly relabeled when angry pork producers complained about sharp drops in pork sales. It’s easier to describe what viruses and diseases should not be called than to suggest what might work “People in my lab are trying to come up with names,” said Baric, a coronavirus researcher at the University of North Carolina. Two candidates have already been rejected: South East Asia respiratory syndrome, or SEARS (for obvious reasons) and Chinese acute respiratory syndrome, CARS, because “that kind of sounds stupid,” he said.It’s been sequenced. It’s spread across borders. Now the new pneumonia-causing virus needs a name\n",

      "A serologic test is a blood test that looks for antibodies created by your immune system. There are many reasons you might make antibodies, the most important of which is to help fight infections. The serologic test for COVID-19 specifically looks for antibodies against the COVID-19 virus. Your body takes at least five to 10 days after you have acquired the infection to develop antibodies to this virus. For this reason, serologic tests are not sensitive enough to accurately diagnose an active COVID-19 infection, even in people with symptoms. However, serologic tests can help identify anyone who has recovered from coronavirus. This may include people who were not initially identified as having COVID-19 because they had no symptoms, had mild symptoms, chose not to get tested, had a false-negative test, or could not get tested for any reason. Serologic tests will provide a more accurate picture of how many people have been infected with, and recovered from, coronavirus, as well as the true fatality rate.Serologic tests may also provide information about whether people become immune to coronavirus once they've recovered and, if so, how long that immunity lasts. In time, these tests may be used to determine who can safely go back out into the community.Scientists can also study coronavirus antibodies to learn which parts of the coronavirus the immune system responds to, in turn giving them clues about which part of the virus to target in vaccines they are developing.Serological tests are starting to become available and are being developed by many private companies worldwide.

      "ECDC estimates that between 15 000 and 75 000 people die prematurely due to causes associated with seasonal influenza infection each year in the EU, the UK, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. This is approximately 1 in every 1 000 people who are infected. Despite the relatively low mortality rate for seasonal influenza, many people die from the disease due to the large number of people who contract it each year. The concern about COVID-19 is that, unlike influenza, there is no vaccine and no specific treatment for the disease. It also appears to be more transmissible than seasonal influenza. As it is a new virus, nobody has prior immunity, which means that the entire human population is potentially susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.Is this virus comparable to SARS or to the seasonal flu?\n",

      "Since the outbreak of COVID-19, social distancing has provided a means to “flatten the curve” and hopefully, reduce the curve. There are significant epidemiological and economic risks and uncertainties to the policies. New estimates for the epidemiological consequences and criterion for when these policies are removed do not tell the full story of social impact by themselves and must be paired with clarity around economic impacts, and how these vary by industry sector.\n",
      "To better ground the economic costs of remaining in effect, we have estimated the economy-wide impacts of a set of social distancing policies that have been used across the United States. Our estimates provide a sense of the likely economic toll due to these policies.The economic toll is not just tied to those industries directly impacted by these policies such as restaurants and bars, but its impacts are being felt across the board due to supply chain disruptions and a reduction in demand. Weekly unemployment numbers (PDF) cut across every geography, industry, and class. The important interconnections that make an economy strong also provide a means for disruptions to cascade throughout the entire economy.Our results show that the economic costs of these policies vary widely across states, with aggregate income declines of 45 percent in states like Indiana, Wisconsin and Iowa for our worst-case scenario. These results do not take into account the reduction in demand that is likely to arise due to unemployment and households staying home. Based on our national level results, for every week that we have strict social distancing policies in place, we are reducing the Gross National Income (GNI) by approximately 0.5 percent. That is, if these policies are kept in place for three months, it would likely mean a drop of 6 percent due solely to the social distancing policies. If a modest 10 percent reduction in household demand is included, these results increase to a 9 percent drop in GNI.It is important to recognize that these economic costs are balanced by decreasing infection, hospitalization, and deaths. It is up to the state and local decisionmakers to weigh the benefits and costs of these policies. Our hope is that we are helping provide one side of the story.Supply Chain Disruptions Due to COVID-19 and Social Distancing\n",

      "CORONAVIRUS chaos appeared to come out of the blue as the illness has swiftly impacted countries all over the world. However, it has emerged that scientists warned about a new deadly virus long ago, deeming it a remote threat at the time and dubbing it \"Disease X\".The World Health Organisation released a report in 2017 in which various pathogens that posed a risk and needed addressing were listed. Featuring among the threats were Nipah disease, which causes a range of illnesses from asymptomatic infection to acute respiratory illness and fatal encephalitis (inflammation of the brain). The list was comprised of viruses which had no known treatments or vaccines, and all had the potential to trigger pandemics that could kill thousands – just as Ebola and swine flu did in previous years.But later on, a new illness was added: Disease X.The mysterious name referred to “a serious international epidemic caused by a pathogen currently unknown”.It added that humanity should now be working to seek out and tackle unknown diseases, but assumed they would remain a remote threat for some time.The recent outbreak of coronavirus – known as Covid-19 – bears similarities to the description of Disease X and suggests that researchers underestimated the danger of an enigmatic virus they the likes they warned of three years earlier.As the NHS highlights, coronavirus' main symptoms include a cough, a high temperature and shortness of breath.While scientists have been able to flag various illnesses as potential threats, some have argued that the research has been negligent in some areas, allowing the coronavirus breakout to occur under the radar.Dr Josie Golding, epidemics lead at the Wellcome Trust said: “World health authorities have spent a lot of time and money making plans for dealing with the next major outbreak, which was assumed would be an influenza pandemic. A lot of investment has gone into making influenza vaccines, for example.“But have we been thinking about diseases other than influenza that might become pandemics? I don’t think we have. There has been a real gap in our thinking.\"We just didn’t envisage a Disease X emerging on the scale we had seen with an influenza pandemic. We will do that in future.”The death toll from the coronavirus outbreak in mainland China reached 1770 as of the end of Sunday, up by 105 from the previous day.At least 100 of the new deaths were from the province of Hubei, the epicentre of the epidemic, the Commission said on Monday morning.Across the country, there were 2048 new confirmed infections, about 1933 from Hubei alone, pushing the new total to 70548.But there are fears that Africa, a continent yet to be heavily impacted by the chaos, could be extremely vulnerable should the illness arrive on its shores.Given that healthcare resources in many of the countries are scarce, and infrastructure pales in comparison to more developed countries, the death toll could rise significantly if the continent becomes affected.The epicentre of the pandemic is in Wuhan, China, and given that the country has grown its political and economic links to a number of African countries, people in places such as Nigeria and South Africa are especially at risk.Other nations among the 13 labelled as more vulnerable than most include Kenya and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, leading the World Health Organisation to mark these areas as high priority.Trade moving between China and Africa accumulated more than £150billion in 2018, figures from the China-Africa Research Initiative at Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies shows.The closer political and economic ties between Beijing and the continent mean that Africa could be vulnerable in the future.Did scientists know about coronavirus before outbreak?

      "About 60% of newly emerged and re-emerging pathogens share a common origin: the bodies of animals. Genetic and epidemiological evidence suggest that the novel coronavirus, like SARS, may have emerged from a so-called “wet market,” where wild species that would rarely encounter each other in nature are crammed together, allowing microbes to spread between species and into humans. China claimed to have cracked down on these markets after the SARS outbreak, but when I visited a few years later, it wasn’t hard to find one. But such markets are only part of the problem. The loss of wildlife habitat around the world more generally is forcing wild species to cram into closer proximity to human settlements. Bats, for example, have been fingered as the source of Ebola, SARS, and a host of other pathogens. When we cut down the forests where they live, they come roost in our backyards and farms instead. It’s this kind of novel, intimate contact that provides opportunities for the microbes that live in their bodies to spread into ours.Why are wild animals believed to be the source of this outbreak?\n",

      "ESCAPED? Given China’s poor track record with lab safety management, the virus is likely to have escaped from a facility, public health researcher Fang Chi-tai cited the opinions of other researchers as saying. Humans likely synthesized COVID-19, although more studies are needed to be certain, National Taiwan University (NTU) public health researcher Fang Chi-tai (方啟泰) said yesterday as he cited the opinions of other researchers.During his presentation at a disease-prevention education seminar held at NTU by the Taiwan Public Health Association — which invited several public health study professors and researchers to give presentations that were also broadcast live via Facebook — Fang addressed numerous hypotheses that have been raised by foreign researchers, including the possibility that the virus was leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.He has heard of many US and Europe-based researchers who are asserting that the virus was inextricably linked to the institute, Fang said, adding this assertion was highly possible as the facility’s biosafety level 4 laboratory houses samples of SARS, Ebola and other deadly viruses.Given China’s poor track record with lab safety management and overall lab culture, it is highly likely that a virus escaped from the facility, he cited the opinions of other researchers as saying.Analyses of COVID-19 have shown that is has a 96 percent genetic similarity with an RaTG13 bat virus at the institute, he said.While viruses need to be at least 99 percent similar to call them “the same,” it is the differences in particular that have led researchers to speculate that COVID-19 was manufactured by modifying RaTG13, he said.A French research team that examined the gene sequence of COVID-19 has discovered that it has four more amino acids than other coronaviruses, he said, adding that this makes its transmission easier.The findings have led some in the research community to speculate about whether China’s scientists intended to develop a virus more difficult to contain than SARS, he said.If that was their intent, they appeared to have succeeded, Fang added.Mutations of viruses that occur naturally only result in small, singular changes, he said, adding that one would not normally see a naturally mutated virus suddenly take on four amino acids.While such a large mutation is not impossible, it is highly unlikely, he said.However, only an internal administrative review at the institute could rule out whether the virus was manufactured there, he said.Such an investigation would require access to lab records, which is unlikely to happen in the short term, he added. Determining the source of the coronavirus has important implications for epidemiology, Fang said, adding that if the virus does not occur in nature, then it is likely to be entirely stamped out. This is quite different from forms of influenza, which cannot be easily eradicated, because they are part of the ecosystem, Fang added.Virus Outbreak: COVID-19 likely synthetic: Researchers say\n",

As of May 7, Chinese health authorities had acknowledged over 83970 cases and 4637 deaths – most of them within the province of Hubei. Since March, however, the country has seen a remarkable slowdown. on March 17, China recorded just 39 new cases of the virus.

By the time he has a fever and / or a cough and goes to the lung hospital, the patient may have 50% fibrosis,and then, its too late! Taiwanese experts provide simple self-monitoring that we can do every morning. Take a deep breath and hold your breath for more than 10 seconds. If you can do this successfully without coughing and without difficulty, without anxiety and chest tightness,it shows that you do not have fibrosis and generally indicate no infection. Check yourself every morning in a fresh air environment. The Japanese physician treating COVID-19 provides the best advice on preventing this: Everyone should make sure the mouth and throat are always moist.Drink some water every 15 minutes. Why not? Even if the virus gets into your mouth, drinking water or other fluids will help wash it down the esophagus into the stomach. When the virus is in the stomach, the hydrochloric acid in your stomach will kill the germs. If you do not drink enough water regularly, the virus can enter the airways and into your lungs, which is very dangerous to get.Great prevention advice , please share with all your loved ones.\n",

We will have a lag and cases will increase for the next week or so. Then we’ll begin to know how successful we have been.”Ardern told parliament the lockdown was triggered by early evidence of community transmission of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.At a news conference later in the day Ardern said modeling suggested New Zealand could have several thousands cases of COVID-19 before the numbers start coming down.“If you have any questions about what you can or can’t do, apply a simple principle: Act like you have COVID-19,” Ardern said.“Every move you then make is a risk to someone else.

Pasteur believed that diseases were caused by outside pathogens invading the body. Antoine Béchamp a Pasteur contemporary, disagreed. He believed that it was that the condition of the body, the terrain, was the source of illness. A healthy body is dependent upon its acid/base balance; its charge; the amount of toxicity and its nutritional status. Only tissue that is already diseased can harbor organisms that become pathogenic. We are starting to appreciate our complicated relationships with the microbial world as we have begun to explore the wonderful world of our microbiomes.

Temperatures rise as it is part of the body’s natural defense mechanism, but not always. There are aches and pains and general malaise and coughing. Most of us take to our beds until we feel better. However, some days after the viral assault, pneumonia (inflammation of the lungs), caused by bacteria can set in. This infection can become life threatening as it spreads, and organ systems become compromised. If someone is already struggling with organ system problems, let’s say with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or renal issues, this can become the tipping point. The infection can lead to sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response, shutting down organ systems leading to death. Even in young healthy people, this response, also called a cytokine storm, can overwhelm the body.Back to Antoine Béchamp.This is the other option. We can choose to help our body’s terrain remain in its healthy state, and if we get sick we can choose to return our body to that healthy state rather than embrace warfare on our microbial world and be left with the consequences of the “friendly fire”. The rest of this article will focus on staying well and getting well despite a flu epidemic. Admittedly, it is getting to be more and more difficult. Our water, our air and our food have become compromised like never before in human history.Basic and Free (or almost). Wash your hands. We can’t live our lives and avoid contact with other people. However, we can minimize the challenges to our immune system by frequently washing your hands. After the SARS outbreak in 2003, a Toronto epidemiologist related that the installation of  numerous handwashing stations and maintaining sanitary protocols stopped the spread of SARS in its tracks.Plain soap and water will do. You can find alcohol and chemical wipes everywhere, but this is not the best choice as these chemicals strip your skin of their natural oils which also protect you.  It’s better to use wipes that have been infused with essential oils. Essential oils have power antiviral activities and can be inhaled and infused. Using a diffuser in public spaces such as schools could cut down viral transmission. This reference holds a long list of the most effective essential oils and herbal remedies.The So-Called Flu Season. “...it has been my observation that those patients receiving a Vitamin D injection in the fall have never had a substantial cold or flu during the winter. Interestingly, the dose of a single injection is 400000 IU (International Units). While that seems a substantial dose, after administering many thousands of injections, I have never seen an example of the Vitamin D levels climbing too high. As a matter of fact, some individuals are so depleted at the intracellular level that they might need 2 or 3 injections over the winter months to preserve optimal levels of vitamin D.”  Dr. Dale Guyer, Indianapolis posting in Facebook. Vitamin D is a primary tool for preventing infection of all kinds. The flu season coincides with the greatest lack of sunshine and the opportunity to create vitamin D in the skin. It is easily supplemented. Optimal levels should be 70-80 ng/ml. Supplementing vitamin D can be preventative. High doses can be used to treat an acute incidence of the flu. Linus Pauling and Vitamin C.Linus Pauling’s claim to fame was to make vitamin C a household word. He extolled the virtues of vitamin for prevention and treatment for colds and the flu. Vitamin C can be used in smaller doses as prevention and ramped up to bowel tolerance for treatment. In severe cases, a physician may offer even higher doses in an IV treatment to speed recovery from the flu. Using vitamin C in a phospholipid delivery system can also provide higher and effective doses. Hydrocortisone.Dr. William Jefferies spent his entire career studying hydrocortisone or cortisol. In his 80’s, he made an interesting discovery. After deliberately infecting some volunteer students, he discovered that the virus inhibited the pituitary hormone ACTH which is responsible for the adrenal production of hydrocortisone. That feeling of malaise and the aches and pains and headaches that come with the flu are quickly eradicated by using supplemental hydrocortisone.  Practitioners can provide the drug Cortef to be used orally. However, hydrocortisone 1 % cream can be found in drug stores and applied to the skin. To prevent the flu, establish that there are no underlying hydrocortisone deficiencies. Practitioners rely on an Adrenal Stress Index saliva test or morning cortisol in the serum to identify problems. Dr. Jefferies used maintenance doses such as 5 mg of hydrocortisone every 6 hours. In the case of an acute flu, larger doses should be used immediately, and relief is rapid.Ozone.Antibiotics are starting to fail as mentioned above. But we really don’t have to worry much despite the dire prognostications. Ozone, a gas, which is a very reactive form of oxygen can treat any infection. Ozone treated water can be used in hand washing and cleaning surfaces.  Ozonated oils such as olive oil can be gargled if there is a sore throat. You can use ozone in your ears, vaginally, or rectally for a full body treatment. You can also ozonate your bath water. A practitioner can help you with intravenous options if a serious infection has persisted. The American Association of Ozone Therapy is a great resource to learn about ozone.\n",
      "To Be Continued.We are just scratching the surface so far on all the methods we may use to deter getting an infection and what steps we can take to treat an infection. Humanity has survived on the earth for millions of years. There are multiple modalities, both conventional and traditional that can strengthen the immune system and help prevent infections. We can open the door to rediscover and identify our rich histories of healing modalities. We have choices. We don’t have to rely only on hastily devised, unproven and untested therapies alone.Don't forget to read the companion article: https://worldhealth.net/news/2020-coronavirus-report/.The full project can been viewed at: https://www.drklatz.org/corona-virus-solution.Article courtesy of: Carol Petersen RPh CNP.Carol Petersen is an accomplished compounding pharmacist with decades of experience helping patients improve their quality of life through bioidentical hormone replacement therapy with Women’s International Pharmacy.

      "The coronavirus is providing a global rallying cry for conspiracy theorists and far-right extremists on both sides of the Atlantic.\n",
      "People seizing on the pandemic range from white supremacists and anti-vaxxers in the U.S. to fascist and anti-refugee groups across Europe, according to a POLITICO review of thousands social media posts and interviews with misinformation experts tracking their online activities. They also include far-right populists on both continents who had previously tried to coordinate their efforts after the 2016 American presidential election.\n",
      "Not all online groups peddling messages on the pandemic have links to the far right, but those extremists have become especially vocal in using the outbreak to push their political agenda at a time of deepening public uncertainty and economic trauma. They are piggybacking on social media to promote coronavirus-related themes drawn from multiple sources — among them, Russian and Chinese disinformation campaigns, the Trump administration’s musings about the coronavirus’ origins and anti-Muslim themes from India’s nationalist ruling party.“Honestly, it’s a dream come true for any and every hate group, snake oil salesman and everything in between,” said Tijana Cvjetićanin, a fact-checker in the Balkans who has watched ultranationalist groups promoting hate-filled messages on social media about the coronavirus, often against Jewish communities.Civil rights advocates have warned for months that the coronavirus could aid recruiting for the most extreme white-supremacist and neo-Nazi groups — those actively rooting for society’s collapse. Some online researchers say they also worry about the barrage of false messages from extremist groups feeding what the U.N. has dubbed an “infodemic” that makes it hard to separate fact from fiction.Opponents of government lockdown orders have used online platforms to organize protests across the U.S., including rallies where activists displayed guns inside Michigan’s state capitol. In Europe, rumors linking the coronavirus to 5G wireless technology have led to dozens of arson attacks on telecommunications masts — a phenomenon that now appears to have spread to Canada.“It's like hitting conspiracy bingo,” said Graham Brookie, director of the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensics Research Lab, which is tracking coronavirus misinformation.From 4chan to Facebook.As the world economy craters and the coronavirus’ global death toll ticks past 280000 people, extremist messages are finding fertile ground on fringe online platforms like 4chan, Telegram and a gamer hangout called Discord. From there, such harmful content can make its way to mainstream sites like Facebook and Google-owned YouTube — each boasting roughly 2 billion users apiece — despite the companies’ attempts to weed out violent or dangerous content.\n",
      "Facebook said last week that one collection of fake accounts and pages it removed in April — tied to two anti-immigrant websites in the U.S. — had drawn more than 200000 followers with messages including the hashtag “#ChinaVirus” and a false claim that the coronavirus mainly kills white people. Twitter announced Monday that it would begin more aggressively labeling tweets that contain misleading or harmful coronavirus information.But plenty of other fake coronavirus content continues to thrive online. That includes a slickly produced online video, called “Plandemic,” that garnered millions of views across YouTube, Twitter and Facebook over the weekend by promoting bogus medical cures and other conspiracy theories tied to the coronavirus. The video remains in wide circulation.\n",
      "One coronavirus-related term, “Coronachan,” has also exploded on social media, first emerging in January and drawing more than 120000 shares on Twitter in one week in late April, according to the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a London-based think tank that tracks extremist groups. (The term is a play on the name of 4chan, a message board that is a favorite gathering spot for the global far right.) In Germany, Telegram groups where influential extremists and far-right activists attack vulnerable groups have doubled their number of followers, to more than 100000 participants since February, according to a review by POLITICO of those accounts.The themes of far-right posts include long-standing grievances, including allegations that migrants spread disease, support for President Donald Trump’s proposed border wall, antagonism toward the EU or opposition to gun control. One online rumor, accusing Microsoft founder Bill Gates of creating the coronavirus, echoes centuries-old conspiracy theories and Anti-Semitic tropes about global elites pulling the world’s strings.“These aren’t new lines they are spinning,” said Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate. “They will use anything they can, whether it’s coronavirus or something else, to bring people into their radical world.”Public figures helping stoke the fires include French nationalist leader Marine Le Pen, whose Facebook account has more than 1.5 million followers, and Trump, who has defended his use of the term “Chinese virus” and pushed the theory that the disease may have come from a lab in China, despite pushback from his intelligence and defense agencies.Extremist groups on the two continents have tried before to coordinate their messaging, with middling success.\n",
      "After Trump’s surprise victory in 2016, far-right online communities sprouted up across the U.S. and Europe, at first using online platforms like Facebook and Google before shifting their focus to smaller, less-regulated networks to share conspiracy theories or organize protests.\n",
      "Americans like Steve Bannon, Trump’s former White House chief strategist, also tried to export U.S.-style online tactics in hopes of uniting European right-wing groups like Italy’s Northern League party and Le Pen’s National Rally in France, though, as POLITICO reported last year, he struggled to win over movements on the Continent.Now, as the coronavirus gives the far right a new impetus to find audiences, many European activists are wielding the same U.S.-style tactics they have spent years learning to emulate, including the creation of online “meme banks” of photos designed to spread widely. That leaves them less in need of outside help, according to researchers tracking their movements.“Europe’s far-right no longer needs additional resources from its transatlantic supporters,” said Chloe Colliver, who heads the digital research unit at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue.Blaming minorities. It does not take much digging through the online platforms to find far-right messages on the health crisis.In Italy, extremist news outlets have flooded social media with reports blaming that country’s devastating coronavirus outbreak on migrants, including an online attack that singled out a Pakistani employee at a Chinese restaurant in a northern Italian town.In France, activists called for sending non-white populations back to their “home” countries, while Le Pen, the far-right leader, alleged on Facebook that mosques had have “taken advantage of the confinement orders” by blaring “the muezzin's call to Islamic prayer” on loudspeakers.Tommy Robinson, the British anti-immigration activist, has promoted the “#GermJihad” hashtag and reposted online messages from members of India’s ruling nationalist BJP party to his more than 36000 followers on Telegram, according to the Center for Countering Digital Hate’s review of his posts.Others, on sites like Facebook and Reddit, have alleged that the Chinese created the coronavirus as a bioweapon to attack the U.S. economy, and will reap the windfall if they are not stopped. “China will become even more brazen and take down western economies with more filth in the future,” one Reddit user wrote.Those claims go much further than the recent speculation by Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that the coronavirus originated in a government lab in Wuhan, China. (The president said this month that he thinks the Chinese “made a horrible mistake and they didn’t want to admit it.”)\n",
      "While some online far-right users have jumped on Trump’s messages, others had already been promoting anti-China rhetoric before senior U.S. politicians began railing on Beijing, according to a review of social media posts from early February.Attacking governments.Extremists are also using the coronavirus to call for resistance against their governments.In Telegram channels with tens of thousands of followers, users mostly in the U.S. urged people to take up arms to protest the lockdowns and protect their civil liberties, sometimes posting photos of themselves dressed in biohazard suits and carrying automatic weapons, according to research from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue.European far-right groups also have called for national governments to reclaim their power from the EU — a message primarily focused on countries like Greece, Spain and Italy where some people remain bitter about how the bloc treated them during the 2008 financial crisis. Those countries similarly have seen a spike in Russian disinformation campaigns, mostly through Kremlin-backed media outlets, aimed at sowing doubt about Europe’s response to the coronavirus, according to a recent review conducted by EU disinformation officials obtained by POLITICO.A far more extreme incident occurred in the U.S. in March, when the FBI shot and killed a Missouri man who agents said had been plotting to blow up a hospital to call attention to his white supremacist beliefs. The man, who had posted anti-Semitic remarks on Telegram hours before being killed, had chosen the target because of \"media attention on the health sector\" during the pandemic, the bureau said in a statement quoted by NBC News.Misinformation experts at the Oxford Internet Institute documented Facebook groups across 33 states aimed at instigating opposition to quarantine measures that rob people of their freedoms and ability to earn a living, according to Aliaksandr Herasimenka, a postdoctoral researcher. Some had fewer than 10000 members, while others had grown much larger.“The similarity and design of their Facebook groups suggests that many of these protests across individual states are related to each other,” said Herasimenka. It “might be directed, not necessarily managed, but directed or inspired by some centralized lobby groups that we don't know exactly what they are.”Facebook has removed some of the protests from its network after determining they had violated state orders by encouraging people to take actions that could spread the coronavirus. But the policy hasn’t applied consistently across the social network, and Facebook has been adamant that it is not policing people’s political opinions. The company has often left it to a global network of independent fact-checkers to debunk the worst online offenders or counter misinformation by pointing people to credible sources.Several of the recently created U.S. Facebook groups have been spearheaded by the Dorr family, brothers who manage a series of aggressively U.S. pro-gun organizations, The Washington Post reported last month. One Dorr-connected private group called Wisconsinites Against Excessive Quarantine attracted 118000 members; its Pennsylvania affiliate counts 89000, according to a review of these Facebook groups. The Dorrs did not respond to requests for comment through their advocacy organizations.“The audience for this stuff isn't the average American news consumer and I'm not even sure the audience is the average person stuck at home sheltering in place,” said Philip Howard, director of the Oxford Internet Institute. “It’s people who are reluctant to take any advice or instructions from the government at any time, whether it's about guidelines on what kinds of guns you can have or whether it's health-related instructions to stay at home.”\n",
      "'There's only one conversation'. The anti-vaccine movement on both continents has also latched onto the coronavirus pandemic.Media Matters for America, a liberal media watchdog, found posts within U.S. Facebook groups claiming the pandemic is an effort to force people into accepting vaccines and, perhaps, even a surreptitious plot to inject people with microchips. Similar messages appeared in WhatsApp messages shared widely in Italy, which has a long-standing anti-vaxxer community, while groups in France have called for a boycott of any government-backed coronavirus vaccine program.U.S. anti-vaccine groups also organized an anti-lockdown rally this month outside California’s state capitol and have taken part in protests in New York, Colorado and Texas, using their opposition to state-ordered shutdowns as part of a broader message about personal “freedom,” The New York Times reported.\n",
      "Other coronavirus themes emerging online include long-running conspiracy theories blaming the “global elites” for much of the world’s ills, particularly focusing on George Soros, the Hungarian-born billionaire who has long been a target for right-wing and anti-Semitic groups.Since late January, attacks against Soros and his fellow billionaire Gates have shifted to accusing the men of either spreading the coronavirus or capitalizing on it to push a pro-vaccine agenda. Some Facebook users in private online groups seen by POLITICO also questioned whether Gates was also Jewish. Gates, who has made global public health a priority of his philanthropic efforts, has drawn their attention because of a 2015 video in which he discussed the dangers of a future global pandemic.\n",
      "“Diseases have long been used to promote disinformation,” said Ben Nimmo, director of investigations at Graphika, the social media analysis firm, who has tracked the spread of coronavirus extremist content.“But right now, there’s only one conversation that everyone is having, and that’s about the coronavirus,” he added. “The disinformation actors know that as well, and they are trying to take advantage.”Conspiracy theorists, far-right extremists around the world seize on the pandemic \n",

I can stop anytime I want.’ But it’s not that simple, and soon the virus has you in its seductive grip. So, if you see someone collapsing from a fever, just tell them, ‘No thanks, I don’t need an infectious agent to have fun,'” he continued.The medical officer also advised that if you feel you absolutely must try the coronavirus, be sure to contract it from someone you know and trust as it may turn out to be something more lethal, such as Avian Flu or SARS.WHO on the same say stated that the global risk from the deadly virus was “high,” admitting an error in its previous communications published on Thursday, Friday and Saturday which “incorrectly” said the global risk was “moderate”.In a report published late on Sunday, Jan. 26, the UN health body said the risk was “very high in China, high at the regional level and high at the global level.”There are at least five confirmed cases of the Wuhan coronavirus in the US, all people who’d traveled recently to Wuhan, China, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Sunday. They are now in isolation hospitals.Three cases were confirmed Sunday: one in Maricopa County, Arizona; one in Los Angeles County, California; and one in Orange County, California.Two others were previously reported: one in Everett, Washington, and another in Chicago. All of the patients will be evaluated case by case before they’re released, according to NBC News. The U.S. State Department said on Sunday it was arranging a flight from Wuhan to San Francisco for consulate staff and other Americans in the city.President Trump said that his administration is watching the virus outbreak closely.The CDC is screening travelers from Wuhan at several U.S. airports, including in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and John F.

      "Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Chair of Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance, says it's important to use the lessons leant fighting Ebola to overcome COVID-19.\n",
      "She stresses that this time must be used to bolster and prepare weaker health systems and that the development and global distribution of a vaccine should be our highest priority.The Democratic Republic of Congo will soon pass a milestone marking its success in the fight against Ebola. As Africa braces for COVID-19, one lesson from the DRC is that the best hope for defeating the coronavirus is not social distancing, but a vaccine that is distributed equitably.On April 12, the Democratic Republic of the Congo will mark 42 days since the last person who tested positive for Ebola was discharged from the hospital.The date is a significant milestone. It refers to twice the maximum incubation period – 21 days – of the virus, which is how the World Health Organization stipulates when an outbreak is over. If all goes well, it will be a remarkable turnaround for the DRC and a testament to the bravery and dedication of health workers, some of whom lost their lives treating the sick.The DRC’s success in combating Ebola was overshadowed by the fact that, during that fight, approximately twice as many people died from a preventable measles outbreak. One essential lesson for policymakers grappling with the greatest global health crisis in a century is that they must do everything in their power to prevent overstretched health systems from battling two epidemics simultaneously.Bloodshed and fighting during a brutal civil war exacerbated the challenge facing the DRC as it fought the Ebola and measles outbreaks. The country experienced profound difficulties immunizing its population against entirely preventable diseases. It found itself fighting a multi-front health battle when it desperately needed to marshal its available resources against a major threat.The trajectory of COVID-19 may be less advanced in many of the world’s poorest countries, but we must not fool ourselves that a warmer climate, or a younger demographic profile, will blunt its impact. The potential for death and disruption is even more pronounced than in the richer countries where the virus has hit hardest.And yet weathering two significant health threats simultaneously has shown us how to prevent this nightmare scenario.Our first priority is to maintain existing immunization programs. For measles, polio, or any other disease for which a low-cost vaccine is routinely available, it is critical that herd immunity is maintained in order to prevent any unnecessary drain on scarce health-care resources.Next, we must bolster preparedness. A number of organizations, including Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (of which I am Chair), have made funds available – $200-$300 million in Gavi’s case – to help the world’s poorest health systems step up surveillance activities, invest in testing, procure protective equipment, and train health workers. Technology is playing a part, too: Despite valid privacy concerns, some countries are rolling out tracing apps – a relatively low cost, effective way to mitigate the virus’ spread. Africa is also using drones to distribute vaccines, protective equipment, and other vital supplies to remote areas.Social distancing will slow the spread of COVID-19, but it will not win the war. Our best hope lies in finding a vaccine. While there may be 41 candidates of varying promise in the pipeline, we must learn from past mistakes. Too often, governments have sequestered vaccines in the countries where they were manufactured. We must ensure that when an effective vaccine becomes available, it is accessible to anyone who needs it, not just the rich, fortunate few.There are ways to avoid the inequitable distribution of vaccines. Gavi, which procures and distributes vaccines to 60% of the world’s children at affordable prices, regularly employs innovative mechanisms such as the International Finance Facility for Immunization, Advanced Market Commitment, and Advanced Purchase Commitment to encourage vaccine production and delivery. In the case of Ebola, Gavi created incentivizes for Merck to stockpile an experimental Ebola vaccine that was then made available to the WHO, which deployed it in the DRC. It can incentivize the production, scale, and equitable global distribution of a vaccine for COVID-19 as well.Poorer countries in Africa and elsewhere may be unable to deal with both the health and economic fallout of this pandemic on their own. The global effort that is already underway is essential, because COVID-19 knows no borders. No country is safe until every country is safe.We are not yet near the end of the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis. We must use what precious time we have to bolster our weakest health systems and economies. But shoring up our defenses is not enough. We must go on the offensive by making the development and global distribution of a vaccine our highest priority.Why vaccines are the only real solution to pandemics, according to Gavi\n",

      "A vaccine for Covid-19 isn’t around the corner. Bringing vaccines to the market is a notoriously slow process and any potential vaccine will have to pass multiple stages of testing for safety and effectiveness. And once we know a vaccine is safe, we will also need to manufacture it at a scale high enough to use across the world. It’s likely that any vaccine is around 18 months away.That said, there is lots of work being done to develop a vaccine for Covid-19. The pharmaceutical firm Sanofi is trying to build on its already-approved flu vaccine and turn it into something suitable to treat Covid-19. Other approaches – such as one being trialled by the University of Oxford – are focusing on the external spike proteins on the Covid-19 virus as a way to target vaccines.But accelerating these efforts will require funding.

      "Many hardline environmentalists are overjoyed at the atmosphere of fear that Covid-19 has created; for them, it is an instrument for realising the dream of a society that runs according to climate alarmists’ dogma. “Some believe the pandemic is a once-in-a-generation chance to remake society and build a better future,” argues one advocate of climate alarmism.  So, in case you thought that Covid-19 is a global pandemic of catastrophic proportions, think again! In the West, hardline environmentalists are working overtime to portray Covid-19 as payback for all the miseries that humans have inflicted on the planet. They claim that global warming, species extinction, the emergence of superbugs and the eating of meat are somehow directly or indirectly linked to the outbreak of the current pandemic. They regard the fears and anxiety generated by the current public health emergency as an opportunity to promote the message that, unless we accept their dogma, humanity will become extinct. Some of them are positively overjoyed at the opportunity created by the climate of fear that’s all-pervasive across the world. “We’ve been trying for years to get people out of normal mode and into emergency mode,” enthused Margaret Klein Salamon, who heads the advocacy group The Climate Mobilization. She added that “what is possible politically is fundamentally different when lots of people get into emergency mode – when they fundamentally accept that there’s danger, and that if we want to be safe we need to do everything we can.”  Keeping people in a state of fear of what they euphemistically describe as ‘emergency mode’ is the objective of Klein Salamon. As she stated, “now the challenge is to keep emergency mode activated about climate.”  That’s another way of saying that perpetuating –indeed, institutionalising– a climate of fear is the main objective of this movement. From this perspective Covid-19 is not so much a tragic public health issue but an instrument for realising the dream of a society that runs according to the environmentalist dogma of misanthropic miserabilism. What green fear entrepreneurs really hate is the spirit of human ambition, that refuses to defer to the dictates of nature. This is a spirit that is open to taking risks in order to transform the world through the use of science and technology. From the time when humans stepped out of their caves to taking the risk of travelling to space, there were always those who decided to do what was necessary to conquer their fears. The refusal not to give in to fears is always the first step towards looking for solutions that will allow us to assume greater control over our lives. It is precisely this aspiration to take control and harness the power of nature and science that climate alarmists despise. They despise it so much that they have coined the term ‘human impact’ to suggest that what people have done to the planet is by definition wholly destructive. They hate humans’ impact on the world so much that many of them want to dramatically decrease the number of babies that are born. According to the climate alarmist narrative, being scared for your life is the desirable state to be in. As Klein Salamon indicated, “we need to learn to be scared together, to agree on what we’re terrified about”! Why? Because collective fears will force governments to act! Back in the 17th century, the English philosopher Thomas Hobbes anticipated the green politics of fear in his classic text, The Leviathan. Hobbes claimed that it is good when people are scared and frightened. Why? Because in their state of fear people will readily subject themselves to an absolutist ruler in exchange for his protection. One does not need a PhD in philosophy to understand that climate alarmist politics leads straight to the doorstep of the Leviathan.While you’re terrified of Covid-19, some climate alarmists are overjoyed because, for them, fear is… an OPPORTUNITY\n",

      "I work in the healthcare field. Here’s the problem, we are testing people for any strain of a Coronavirus. Not specifically for COVID-19. There are no reliable tests for a specific COVID-19 virus. There are no reliable agencies or media outlets for reporting numbers of actual COVID-19 virus cases. This needs to be addressed first and foremost. Every action and reaction to COVID-19 is based on totally flawed data and we simply can not make accurate assessments.This is why you’re hearing that most people with COVID-19 are showing nothing more than cold/flu like symptoms. That’s because most Coronavirus strains are nothing more than cold/flu like symptoms. The few actual novel Coronavirus cases do have some worse respiratory responses, but still have a very promising recovery rate, especially for those without prior issues.The ‘gold standard’ in testing for COVID-19 is laboratory isolated/purified coronavirus particles free from any contaminants and particles that look like viruses but are not, that have been proven to be the cause of the syndrome known as COVID-19 and obtained by using proper viral isolation methods and controls (not the PCR that is currently being used or Serology /antibody tests which do not detect virus as such). PCR basically takes a sample of your cells and amplifies any DNA to look for ‘viral sequences’, i.e. bits of non-human DNA that seem to match parts of a known viral genome.The problem is the test is known not to work.It uses ‘amplification’ which means taking a very very tiny amount of DNA and growing it exponentially until it can be analyzed. Obviously any minute contaminations in the sample will also be amplified leading to potentially gross errors of discovery.Additionally, it’s only looking for partial viral sequences, not whole genomes, so identifying a single pathogen is next to impossible even if you ignore the other issues.The Mickey Mouse test kits being sent out to hospitals, at best, tell analysts you have some viral DNA in your cells. Which most of us do, most of the time. It may tell you the viral sequence is related to a specific type of virus – say the huge family of coronavirus. But that’s all. The idea these kits can isolate a specific virus like COVID-19 is nonsense.And that’s not even getting into the other issue – viral load.If you remember the PCR works by amplifying minute amounts of DNA. It therefore is useless at telling you how much virus you may have. And that’s the only question that really matters when it comes to diagnosing illness. Everyone will have a few virus kicking round in their system at any time, and most will not cause illness because their quantities are too small. For a virus to sicken you you need a lot of it, a massive amount of it. But PCR does not test viral load and therefore can’t determine if it is present in sufficient quantities to sicken you.If you feel sick and get a PCR test any random virus DNA might be identified even if they aren’t at all involved in your sickness which leads to false diagnosis.And coronavirus are incredibly common. A large percentage of the world human population will have covi DNA in them in small quantities even if they are perfectly well or sick with some other pathogen.Do you see where this is going yet? If you want to create a totally false panic about a totally false pandemic – pick a coronavirus.They are incredibly common and there’s tons of them. A very high percentage of people who have become sick by other means (flu, bacterial pneumonia, anything) will have a positive. PCR test for covi even if you’re doing them properly and ruling out contamination, simply because covis are so common.There are hundreds of thousands of flu and pneumonia victims in hospitals throughout the world at any one time.All you need to do is select the sickest of these in a single location – say Wuhan – administer PCR tests to them and claim anyone showing viral sequences similar to a coronavirus (which will inevitably be quite a few) is suffering from a ‘new’ disease.Since you already selected the sickest flu cases a fairly high proportion of your sample will go on to die.You can then say this ‘new’ virus has a CFR higher than the flu and use this to infuse more concern and do more tests which will of course produce more ‘cases’, which expands the testing, which produces yet more ‘cases’ and so on and so on.Before long you have your ‘pandemic’, and all you have done is use a simple test kit trick to convert the worst flu and pneumonia cases into something new that doesn’t actually exist.Now just run the same scam in other countries. Making sure to keep the fear message running high so that people will feel panicky and less able to think critically.Your only problem is going to be that – due to the fact there is no actual new deadly pathogen but just regular sick people, you are mislabeling your case numbers, and especially your deaths, are going to be way too low for a real new deadly virus pandemic.But you can stop people pointing this out in several ways.You can claim this is just the beginning and more deaths are imminent. Use this as an excuse to quarantine everyone and then claim the quarantine prevented the expected millions of dead.You can tell people that ‘minimizing’ the dangers is irresponsible and bully them into not talking about numbers.You can talk crap about made up numbers hoping to blind people with pseudoscience.You can start testing well people (who, of course, will also likely have shreds of coronavirus DNA in them) and thus inflate your ‘case figures’ with ‘asymptomatic carriers’ (you will of course have to spin that to sound deadly even though any virologist knows the more symptom-less cases you have the less deadly is your pathogen.Take these 4 simple steps and you can have your own entirely manufactured pandemic up and running in weeks.Manufactured Pandemic: Testing People for Any Strain of a Coronavirus, Not Specifically for COVID-19\n",

      "When a virus passes from a nonhuman animal into a human, we call that moment of spillover a zoonotic transmission. It’s an ecological event. What happens next depends on evolutionary potential and chance. If the virus is adaptable, it may succeed in replicating and proliferating in the new human host. Maybe it kills the person and the line of transmission comes to an end there—as happens with rabies. But if the virus is even more adaptable, it may acquire the ability to pass from one human host to another, perhaps by sexual contact (as with HIV), perhaps in bodily fluids such as blood (as with Ebola), perhaps in respiratory droplets launched by coughing or sneezing (as with influenza or SARS). What makes a virus adaptable? The changeability of its genome, plus Darwinian natural selection. Those viruses with single-stranded RNA genomes, which replicate themselves inaccurately and therefore have highly changeable genomes, are among the most adaptable.

      "Developing and delivering coronavirus vaccines, tests and treatments depends on a massive financial commitment from the private sector. So does the global economic outlook.The dire threat posed by the novel coronavirus is a function of its speed and scope. Wuhan, China, made its first cases public on the last day of 2019. By mid-April this year, the virus had spread to 185 nations, with over 2.5 million total cases and 165000 deaths.“This pandemic is of a completely different order of magnitude,” says Richard Hatchett, C.E.O. of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), an organization tasked with developing effective coronavirus vaccines.Almost $2 billion in funding for vaccines and treatments has flowed from governments, charitable foundations, global organizations and individual donors. But those resources are not enough — an additional $6 billion is needed by early May to develop and deliver vaccines, tests and effective therapies.\n",
      "This appeal is not based solely on public health concerns. If adequate vaccines, treatments and tests are not developed and distributed in time, a rolling cycle of lockdowns and distancing measures could ebb and flow for months, if not years, with new outbreaks and economic downturns postponing recovery indefinitely.\n",
      "For businesses, this could mean a second or third wave of economic contractions. “It’s firmly in the interests of businesses to be part of financing the science that can provide a reliable and sustainable way out of this crisis,” says Jeremy Farrar, director of Wellcome. “It is the only way we can get the world back to something like business as usual.”As such, Wellcome, a global health foundation that is calling on businesses to donate to research and development and join the COVID-Zero coalition, stresses that every industry sector has a vested interest in supporting vaccine, diagnostics and treatment research.Unprecedented acceleration, unprecedented cost\n",
      "While the global economic outlook is difficult to quantify at this early stage of the pandemic, current projections remain dire. In mid-April, the International Monetary Fund predicted cumulative global G.D.P. losses in 2020 and 2021 could reach $9 trillion, while the International Labor Organization warned the pandemic could wipe out the equivalent of almost 200 million full-time jobs — a number equal to the population of Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country.\n",
      "Improving those forecasts depends on a comprehensive response to the pandemic — delivered on a timetable far more accelerated than that of any other public health mobilization in this century. The coronavirus is now an “endemic infection,” says Farrar. “This virus — and its colossal impact on our citizens, economies and health systems — will be with us for quite some time. This is not a one-off event. There will be further waves of this pandemic,” he adds. “Investment now is crucial to give us the best possible chance of developing vaccines, treatments and rapid diagnostics in the fastest time possible.”Farrar argues that private sector fundraising is, therefore, a moral and pragmatic imperative: “These financial contributions will save lives, secure jobs and get the world moving again sooner than anything else.”Funding a crisis exit strategy.Public-private initiatives that address scientific and organizational challenges will play an important role in the pandemic response. One project, the Covid-19 Therapeutics Accelerator, seeded by $125 million in contributions from Wellcome, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Mastercard, takes a multifaceted approach to research and logistics. The initiative has received millions in donations from the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development, the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and private citizens, including the entertainer Madonna.Since there are no drugs yet to treat the disease, the Therapeutics Accelerator is supporting clinical trials for evaluating new and repurposed drugs that may treat or prevent virus outbreaks. It will also streamline funding to remove barriers to development and bring new products to scale in the shortest amount of time, thus reducing risk across the development process and freeing up resources to deliver treatments.Private-sector contributions could play a make-or-break role in numerous response efforts, including injecting some of the $2 billion needed to develop three promising vaccine candidates to late-clinical stages over the next 12 to 18 months. Hatchett calls that timeline “hugely aspirational,” considering the five years it took to bring a licensed Ebola vaccine to market, viewed by experts as an extremely fast response. The donations can also contribute to efforts like WHO’s Covid-19 Solidarity Response Fund, which funds purchases of essential equipment for medical workers, vaccine and test development, and public-education initiatives.\n",
      "Private-sector contributions would enable groups like the Therapeutics Accelerator and CEPI to act rapidly. For example, according to Hatchett, funding from business and philanthropic donors would enable the organization’s eight concurrent candidate vaccine programmes to progress at speed — at a time when all candidates with a good chance of success need to be explored in parallel.Once Covid-19 vaccines are proven to work, more funding will be needed for organizations such as Gavi, a public-private global health partnership that addresses vaccine equity, which will play a critical role in cost-effective distribution.Why Funding the Covid-19 Response Could Be the Best Investment a Business Can Make\n",

      "A pandemic is a global outbreak of disease. Pandemics happen when a new virus emerges to infect people and can spread between people sustainably. Because there is little to no pre-existing immunity against the new virus, it spreads worldwide.The virus that causes COVID-19 is infecting people and spreading easily from person-to-person. On March 11, the COVID-19 outbreak was characterized as a pandemic by the WHOexternal icon.This is the first pandemic known to be caused by a new coronavirus. In the past century, there have been four pandemics caused by the emergence of new influenza viruses. As a result, most research and guidance around pandemics is specific to influenza, but the same premises can be applied to the current COVID-19 pandemic. Pandemics of respiratory disease follow a certain progression outlined in a “Pandemic Intervals Framework.” Pandemics begin with an investigation phase, followed by recognition, initiation, and acceleration phases. The peak of illnesses occurs at the end of the acceleration phase, which is followed by a deceleration phase, during which there is a decrease in illnesses. Different countries can be in different phases of the pandemic at any point in time and different parts of the same country can also be in different phases of a pandemic.COVID-19 Pandemic\n",

      "Governor Andrew Cuomo is considering a temporary six-week ban on the sale of combustible cigarettes in order to reduce the State’s Coronavirus death count, a source familiar with his thinking tells The Chronicle.  The ban could come as soon as Monday and is expected to be included in a budget measure already scheduled to be announced. New data out of Italy suggest that the nation’s whopping Coronavirus death rate — now approaching 10% of those who test positive — is highly correlated to cigarette use.  Italian men smoke cigarettes at rates that far outpace most other developed countries, and the extreme shortage of ventilators there has been the cause of death for tens of thousands of smokers. According to Italy’s National Health Institute, smokers with COVID-19 were one-third more likely to have a serious clinical situation than non-smokers. Half of these smokers required a ventilator. For many weeks, it was observed that women in Italy are better able to overcome the virus than men.  Italian doctors now believe that the statistical difference is attributable to smoking-related gender norms. COVID-19 kills its victims by compromising the respiratory system and reducing oxygen levels in the blood.  Regular cigarette use damages the airways and small air sacs in the lungs.  Combustible cigarettes weaken smokers’ lungs by filling them with smoke and tar. “When a smoker contracts COVID-19, he or she will be far more likely to suffer respiratory system failure, thereby exacerbating New York’s ventilator shortage,” Cuomo plans to say in remarks prepared for Monday.   “Fortunately, medical science informs us that ex-smokers experience significant recovery in lung function and oxygen absorption as soon as they quit smoking.” Former smokers recover 30% of their lung function just two weeks after quitting. “Any ex-smoker can tell you how, just days after quitting, they were noticeably less out of breath after walking up a flight of stairs. Personally, I have heard hundreds of these stories,” he writes in draft remarks. Dr. Howard Zucker, the Commissioner of Health, is prodding Cuomo to issue the temporary ban and discussed the issue with him privately earlier this week.  Zucker has long advocated for additional restrictions on combustible cigarette sales, which causes more than 443000 deaths annually — more deaths each year than from murder, car accidents, alcohol or drug use, suicides, and HIV combined. It’s estimated that 81000 people will die from COVID-19. Zucker argues that a ban on cigarette sales for the duration of the outbreak will save thousands of lives and will reduce the State’s shortage of ventilators, perhaps by several thousand during its peak — expected to hit the State 21 days from today. Therefore, the Governor’s advisors postulate, if New York takes immediate action and temporarily bans combustible cigarette sales during this public health crisis, ex-smokers’ respiratory systems will make significant recovery at the very same time that COVID-19 cases are peaking in New York. “This will save lives, and not just the lives of smokers,” the Governor plans to say.  “Every former smoker that gets sick, but does not need a ventilator, means one more ventilator is available to keep our aging parents and grandparents alive.” “Importantly, we must also recognize that failing to temporarily ban combustible cigarettes immediately will cause a disproportionate increase in COVID-19 fatalities in minority communities, given the higher prevalence of immuno-deficiencies in these communities,” he plans to note. The Governor’s supporters argue that it is more important now than ever to address the public health cost of combustible cigarettes — not just to save the lives of smokers, but to save the lives of all New Yorkers by mitigating the severity of a ventilator shortage.Cuomo considers banning cigarette sales for six weeks amid Coronavirus outbreak\n",

      "The letter does not criticize any specific assertions about the origin of the outbreak, but many posts on social media have singled out the Wuhan Institute of Virology for intense scrutiny because it has a laboratory at the highest security level—biosafety level 4—and its researchers study coronaviruses from bats, including the one that is closest to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Speculations have included the possibility that the virus was bioengineered in the lab or that a lab worker was infected while handling a bat and then transmitted the disease to others outside the lab. Researchers from the institute have insisted there is no link between the outbreak and their laboratory.“We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin,” says The Lancet statement, which praises the work of Chinese health professionals as “remarkable” and encourages others to sign on as well.U.S. Senator Tom Cotton (R–AR) added fuel to controversial assertions on Fox News earlier this month when he noted that the lab was “a few miles away” from a seafood market that had a large cluster of some of the first cases detected. “We don’t have evidence that this disease originated there but because of China’s duplicity and dishonesty from the beginning, we need to at least ask the question to see what the evidence says,” Cotton said, noting that the Chinese government initially turned down the U.S. government’s offer to send scientists to the country to help clarify questions about the outbreak.The authors of The Lancet statement note that scientists from several countries who have studied SARS-CoV-2 “overwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife,” just like many other viruses that have recently emerged in humans. “Conspiracy theories do nothing but create fear, rumours, and prejudice that jeopardise our global collaboration in the fight against this virus,” the statement says.Peter Daszak, president of the EcoHealth Alliance and a cosignatory of the statement, has collaborated with researchers at the Wuhan institute who study bat coronaviruses. “We’re in the midst of the social media misinformation age, and these rumors and conspiracy theories have real consequences, including threats of violence that have occurred to our colleagues in China,” Daszak, a disease ecologist, told ScienceInsider. “We have a choice whether to stand up and support colleagues who are being attacked and threatened daily by conspiracy theorists or to just turn a blind eye.

      "COVID-19 poses a risk not only to the health of older adults who contract the disease but also to those without the health care resources and social structures that contribute to overall wellness. Before becoming a professor, Sarah Szanton made house calls to older adults as a nurse practitioner. On her visits, she saw how an older person's home environment can contribute to health outcomes. Now, as the Endowed Professor for Health Equity and Social Justice at the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing and the director of the Center for Innovative Care in Aging, Szanton works to identify solutions to narrow racial and socioeconomic disparities for older people.Szanton joined one of her PhD student mentees, Sarah LaFave, to discuss the challenges that COVID-19 poses for older adults. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.How is the COVID-19 pandemic affecting older people differently than younger generations?Older adults are more likely to have dire outcomes from the virus. It can also be a challenge to prevent older people from being exposed to the virus because they may not be be fully independent. For example, a mother might rely on her adult daughter to come and help her with groceries or take a shower. As another example, some older people depend on help from a family member or friend with sorting mail and sending in checks to pay bills. At this point, people may not have had someone come into the home to help with those kinds of things for many weeks. What happens if one of those unpaid bills is for an essential resource or accrues a lot of interest during this time?We also have to think about all of the ways that the pandemic affects older people's lives beyond morbidity and mortality from the virus itself. I am concerned about people experiencing social isolation as a result of not being able to have visitors and not being able to go out and do things with other people. The effects are compounded for any older person who doesn't have access to technology platforms like Skype and FaceTime or who has limited access to phone calls. Many lower-income older people have pay-per-minute phone plans, for example, and may have to choose between using their limited minutes for a phone visit with a doctor or a conversation with a grandchild. So we can't assume that a switch to virtual socialization or virtual access to resources is going to work for all older people.Also, I think there's a fair amount of ageism—of people thinking right now, even if they aren't saying it out loud, \"Well, older people are going to die anyway.\" But who are we to say that an 80-year-old wouldn't have otherwise lived to be 100 and done a lot of wonderful things in those 20 years? We would never think that the first 20 years of someone's life don't matter; we should recognize that the last 20 years are just as valuable.Has the pandemic exacerbated health disparities for older adults?Every experience in life is influenced by a person's access to resources and, in the United States, a person's race, socioeconomic status, and other characteristics have profound impacts on access to resources. It can be easy to jump to saying, \"Oh, well, that person was older and had diabetes, so of course they had a worse outcome from COVID.\" But you have to take a step back and ask what contributed to the person having diabetes in the first place. Because race is not biological, we know that it's not race itself that causes disparities in co-morbidities and in COVID outcomes—it's the relationship between race and resources. For example, my colleague Laura Samuel has found that the counties that have a high proportion of people who have to spend more than a third of their income on housing have higher COVID mortality rates. If we had a society that was structured so that everyone had the same chance at health, we would not see the disparities we are seeing.A lot of the potential solutions to health disparities among older adults don't exist in the health care system itself—they occur further upstream. Things like widening access to the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, addressing food deserts, and supporting returning citizens in the workforce all relate directly to health, but we don't always think that way.What challenges has COVID-19 raised for family caregivers of older adults?\n",
      "First, if family caregivers have jobs that require them to be in regular contact with others, such as bus drivers or nurses, they may have to decide between not providing essential help to an older loved one and risking passing the virus to that person.Second, direct care workers continue to come in and out of hospitals, nursing homes, and senior living buildings and are being screened upon entrance, but very few family caregivers are allowed into these same facilities right now. In some cases, family caregivers are not being recognized as essential parts of the health care team, and I think they should be. Hospitals and nursing homes have had to place restrictions on visitors for safety reasons, but I think some of those policies may be too limiting. For example, delirium is a very common and very costly issue for older adults who are admitted to hospitals. There is a better chance of preventing and managing delirium if a family member can help attend to the day-night sleep cycle, keep the person oriented, hydrated, and so on. True delirium uses so many health care resources that it can benefit all of us if an older person has a familiar caregiver with them during an inpatient stay. Of course, a major limitation is that there isn't enough personal protective equipment right now, so you have to weigh the risks and benefits of tapping into a finite supply of protective equipment.\n",
      "What can people do right now to support older adults in their communities during this crisis?There are many volunteer opportunities. For example, Baltimore Neighbors Network is a coalition of community partners that trains and supports volunteers to provide companionship and resource navigation assistance to older adults in Baltimore, which includes remote options such as phone calls. If people can't volunteer for a program like that right now, maybe they can give blood, or maybe they can take the money they would usually spend eating out each month and instead contribute financially to a food pantry. People can also support their older family members or friends by asking the person what would be most helpful to them—maybe it's dropping off a meal on a front porch, maybe it's mailing a letter. It's really important to remember, even during a crisis, to make time for our elders.The impact of COVID-19 on older adults\n",

      "The International Ultraviolet Association and RadTech North America, two industry groups made up of equipment vendors, scientists, engineers and medical professionals who deal with ultraviolet light, discouraged the exposure of parts of the body to ultraviolet light as a disinfectant against coronavirus. “We would like to inform the public that there are no protocols to advise or permit the safe use of UV light directly on the human body at the wavelengths and exposures proven to efficiently kill viruses such as SARS-CoV-2,” a joint news release stated. Trump on April 24 said the comment was meant to be sarcastic and referred to the use of disinfectant on the hands. The White House issued a statement that day blaming media for quoting him out of context. Ultraviolet light as a disinfectant.Ultraviolet light has been used for disinfection for more than 100 years, according to the International Ultraviolet Association.The association's website explains ultraviolet light can be broken up into four categories: UV-A, UV-B, UV-C and vacuum-UV. Each category includes a specific range of wavelengths.UV-A and UV-B are found in sunlight and can cause sunburns or, eventually, melanoma. They are also at times used for disinfection.UV-C, a lower and more powerful wavelength of ultraviolet light than found in sunlight, is commonly used for disinfection in water treatment facilities, surfaces and in hospital settings. It's effective because the radiation inactivates cells from reproducing. So far, no microorganisms have shown immunity to UV exposure.\"For years, we've used UV on air and surfaces and on hospital rooms, with no humans in the room,\" Jim Malley, an ultraviolet light expert and professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of New Hampshire, told USA TODAY. \"We protect ourselves in the laboratory with face shields and gloves to keep the UV away from our eyes and our skin.\" There are also contexts in which controlled ultraviolet light is used as a medical treatment. For example, the American Cancer Society's website explains that doctors may use fluorescent lamps to administer carefully controlled UV-A and UV-B treatments for those with skin lymphoma. What is ultraviolet blood irradiation?.The use of ultraviolet light to \"treat\" blood as a cure for various ailments has been around for years. Known as ultraviolet blood irradiation, or \"BioPhonic Therapy,\" it has not gained widespread acceptance. More:Meat shortages expected as coronavirus disrupts production, despite executive order.The process generally involves withdrawing a measure of blood and running it through a machine that exposes it to ultraviolet rays. The blood is then reintroduced into the person's body. One website advocating for UBI says the process creates a response in the immune system called an “autogenous vaccine,\" which \"stimulates the immune system to destroy any and all pathogens.\"The website includes a lengthy list of diseases aided by the treatment, including lymphoma, various viral infections, bacterial infections, autoimmune diseases, circulation conditions and inflammatory conditions.  In 2015, a company called UVLrx Therapautics began marketing a machine called the UVLrx 1500 in the European Union, touting that it, for the first time, eliminated the need to withdraw blood from the body to perform UBI.The system used an IV catheter to administer a 60-minute treatment into the bloodstream. The treatment included a half-hour of red light and UV-A wavelengths, followed by a half-hour of red and green light wavelengths, according to a news release.More:One in 3 death certificates were wrong before coronavirus. It's about to get even worse.In 2016, Forbes reported the device had begun appearing at alternative medicine practices in the U.S. without approval from the Food and Drug Administration. The company said it was beginning clinical trials of the device. Forbes cited an archived version of the UVLrx website, which no longer exists, that listed the conditions the clinical trial expected to explore, including dengue fever, tuberculosis, sepsis, sports-related injuries, HIV and Hepatitis C, Lyme disease and others. The file for the trial at clinicaltrials.gov, last updated in October 2016, does not include the results of the trial.Medical experts: UBI is not an effective treatment for killing viruses.UBI has faced criticism from medical experts, who say the procedure lacks clinical trials and studies that show its effectiveness.Dr. Michael Hamblin, a former principal investigator at the Wellman Center for Photomedicine at Massachusetts General Hospital and associate professor of dermatology at Harvard Medical School, wrote in a 2018 paper that UBI has become known as the \"cure that time forgot.\"It was used broadly in the 1940s and 1950s as a treatment for many diseases, although its use diminished with the rise of antibiotics, Hamblin wrote. In the years since, UBI has been studied more in Russia and Eastern countries than in the U.S. Hamblin wrote more study should be conducted on the treatment, as there is confusion regarding what is happening during the treatment and has led to controversy about its use. \"Over the years, its acceptance by the broad medical community has been hindered by this uncertainty,\" he wrote, later adding that another source of confusion is the wide array of diseases that some claim UBI can treat, which can appear \"too good to be true.\". More:How to tell the difference between coronavirus symptoms and allergies. Dr. Edzard Ernst, professor emeritus at the University of Exeter and an authority on complementary medicine, wrote a blog post about UBI following Trump's comments last week, in which he called it \"an invasive treatment where lots of things might go badly wrong.\" \"Yes, there are quite a few papers on UBI and related methods,\" he said. \"But most of them are in-vitro studies, while robust clinical trials are missing completely.\"Dr. Mitchell Grayson, a professor of pediatrics and chief of the Division of Allergy and Immunology at Nationwide Children’s Hospital and The Ohio State University, told USA TODAY he has not had experience with any sort of ultraviolet light injection like the one shown in the photograph.\"It doesn't make any sense, from a medical standpoint,\" he said. And since coronavirus lives primarily in a person's lung and intestinal cells, Grayson said he would be skeptical about the effectiveness of ultraviolet irradiation in the bloodstream as a prospective treatment for COVID-19. \"If someone coughs on a park bench, and it’s out in the sunlight for a few hours, that is probably going to work,\" he said. \"Or if the blood bank wants to make sure there’s no coronavirus in blood products, they can irradiate it. But in a living being, I think it’s unlikely to be done and successful.\"Our ruling: False. While ultraviolet blood irradiation exists, it is unproven as an effective treatment in killing infections and is not widely used. There have been studies on ultraviolet blood irradiation in the past, but experts say such treatments need proven clinical trials to gain acceptance among the wider medical community. There is also not research proving UBI as a treatment for the coronavirus. Based on our research, we rule as FALSE the claim that UV light has been injected into the body for years to kill viruses and bacteria.UV light injections are not a common medical treatment — or a COVID-19 cure\n",

Infection is theoretically possible but unlikely at the levels remaining after a few days. People need to know this.While the New England Journal of Medicine study found that the COVID virus can be detected in the air for 3 hours, in nature, respiratory droplets sink to the ground faster than the aerosols produced in this study. The experimental aerosols used in labs are smaller than what comes out of a cough or sneeze, so they remain in the air at face-level longer than heavier particles would in nature.What is the best way I can protect myself, knowing that the virus that causes COVID-19 lives on surfaces?You are more likely to catch the infection through the air if you are next to someone infected than off of a surface. Cleaning surfaces with disinfectant or soap is very effective because once the oily surface coat of the virus is disabled, there is no way the virus can infect a host cell. However, there cannot be an overabundance of caution. Nothing like this has ever happened before.The CDC guidelines on how to protect yourself include:Clean and disinfect surfaces that many people come in contact with. These include tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks. Avoid touching high-contact surfaces in public.\n",
      "Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds immediately when you return home from a public place such as the bank or grocery store.\n",
      "When in a public space, put a distance of six feet between yourself and others.Most importantly, stay home if you are sick and contact your doctor.\n",
      "There has been speculation that once the summer season arrives and the weather warms up, the virus won't survive, but we don't yet know if that is true. Does the weather or indoor temperature affect the survival of the COVID-19 virus on surfaces?There is no evidence one way or the other. The virus's viability in exposure to heat or cold has not been studied. But it does bear pointing out that the New England Journal of Medicine study was performed at about room temperature, 21-23 degrees Celsius.How does the virus that causes COVID-19 compare with other coronaviruses, and why are we seeing so many more cases?\n",
      "SARS-CoV-2 behaves like a typical respiratory coronavirus in the basic mechanisms of infection and replication. But several mutations allow it to bind tighter to its host receptor and increase its transmissibility, which is thought to make it more infectious.The New England Journal of Medicine study suggests that the stability of SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to that of SARS-CoV1, the virus that caused the 2002-2003 SARS global outbreak. But, researchers believe people can carry high viral loads of the SARS-CoV-2 in the upper respiratory tract without recognizing any symptoms, allowing them to shed and transmit the virus while asymptomatic.HOW LONG CAN THE VIRUS THAT CAUSES COVID-19 LIVE ON SURFACES?\n",

      "You've gotten the basics down: you're washing your hands regularly and keeping your distance from friends and family. But you likely still have questions. Are you washing your hands often enough? How exactly will social distancing help? What's okay to do while social distancing? And how can you strategically stock your pantry and medicine cabinet in order to minimize trips to the grocery store and pharmacy? What can I do to protect myself and others from COVID-19? The following actions help prevent the spread of COVID-19, as well as other coronaviruses and influenza: Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. Stay home when you are sick. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces every day. High touch surfaces include counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables. A list of products suitable for use against COVID-19 is available here. This list has been pre-approved by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for use during the COVID-19 outbreak. Wash your hands often with soap and water. This chart illustrates how protective measures such as limiting travel, avoiding crowds, social distancing, and thorough and frequent handwashing can slow down the development of new COVID-19 cases and reduce the risk of overwhelming the health care system.\n",
      "What do I need to know about washing my hands effectively? Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; and after handling anything that's come from outside your home. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty. The CDC's handwashing website has detailed instructions and a video about effective handwashing procedures. How does coronavirus spread? The coronavirus is thought to spread mainly from person to person. This can happen between people who are in close contact with one another. Droplets that are produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes may land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby, or possibly be inhaled into their lungs. A person infected with coronavirus — even one with no symptoms — may emit aerosols when they talk or breathe. Aerosols are infectious viral particles that can float or drift around in the air for up to three hours. Another person can breathe in these aerosols and become infected with the coronavirus. This is why everyone should cover their nose and mouth when they go out in public. Coronavirus can also spread from contact with infected surfaces or objects. For example, a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes. How could contact tracing help slow the spread of COVID-19? Anyone who comes into close contact with someone who has COVID-19 is at increased risk of becoming infected themselves, and of potentially infecting others. Contact tracing can help prevent further transmission of the virus by quickly identifying and informing people who may be infected and contagious, so they can take steps to not infect others. Contact tracing begins with identifying everyone that a person recently diagnosed with COVID-19 has been in contact with since they became contagious. In the case of COVID-19, a person may be contagious 48 to 72 hours before they started to experience symptoms. The contacts are notified about their exposure. They may be told what symptoms to look out for, advised to isolate themselves for a period of time, and to seek medical attention as needed if they start to experience symptoms.What is social distancing and why is it important? The COVID-19 virus primarily spreads when one person breathes in droplets that are produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. In addition, any infected person, with or without symptoms, could spread the virus by touching a surface. The coronavirus could remain on that surface and someone else could touch it and then touch their mouth, nose or eyes. That's why it's so important to try to avoid touching public surfaces or at least try to wipe them with a disinfectant. Social distancing refers to actions taken to stop or slow down the spread of a contagious disease. For an individual, it refers to maintaining enough distance (6 feet or more) between yourself and another person to avoid getting infected or infecting someone else. School closures, directives to work from home, library closings, and cancelling meetings and larger events help enforce social distancing at a community level. Slowing down the rate and number of new coronavirus infections is critical to reduce the risk that large numbers of critically ill patients cannot receive life-saving care. Highly realistic projections show that unless we begin extreme social distancing now — every day matters — our hospitals and other healthcare facilities will not be able to handle the likely influx of patients. What types of medications and health supplies should I have on hand for an extended stay at home? Try to stock at least a 30-day supply of any needed prescriptions. If your insurance permits 90-day refills, that's even better. Make sure you also have over-the-counter medications and other health supplies on hand. Medical and health supplies, prescription medications,prescribed medical supplies such as glucose and blood-pressure monitoring equipment, fever and pain medicine, such as acetaminophen, cough and cold medicines, antidiarrheal medication, thermometer, fluids with electrolytes,  soap and alcohol-based hand sanitizer, tissues, toilet paper, disposable diapers, tampons, sanitary napkins, garbage bags. Should I keep extra food at home? What kind? Consider keeping a two-week to 30-day supply of nonperishable food at home. These items can also come in handy in other types of emergencies, such as power outages or snowstorms. canned meats, fruits, vegetables, and soups, frozen fruits, vegetables, and meat, rotein or fruit bars, dry cereal, oatmeal, or granola, peanut butter or nuts, pasta, bread, rice, and other grains, canned beans, chicken broth, canned tomatoes, jarred pasta sauce, oil for cooking, flour, sugar, crackers, coffee, tea, shelf-stable milk, canned juices, bottled water canned or jarred baby food and formula pet food. household supplies like laundry detergent, dish soap, and household cleaner. What precautions can I take when grocery shopping? The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is primarily transmitted through droplets containing virus, or through viral particles that float in the air. The virus may be breathed in directly and can also spread when a person touches a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touches their mouth, nose, or eyes. There is no current evidence that the COVID-19 virus is transmitted through food. Safety precautions help you avoid breathing in coronavirus or touching a contaminated surface and touching your face. In the grocery store, maintain at least six feet of distance between yourself and other shoppers. Wipe frequently touched surfaces like grocery carts or basket handles with disinfectant wipes. Avoid touching your face. Wearing a cloth mask helps remind you not to touch your face and can further help reduce spread of the virus. Use hand sanitizer before leaving the store. Wash your hands as soon as you get home.If you are older than 65 or at increased risk for any reason, limit trips to the grocery store. Ask a neighbor or friend to pick up groceries and leave them outside your house. See if your grocery store offers special hours for older adults or those with underlying conditions. Or have groceries delivered to your home.What precautions can I take when unpacking my groceries? Recent studies have shown that the COVID-19 virus may remain on surfaces or objects for up to 72 hours. This means virus on the surface of groceries will become inactivated over time after groceries are put away. If you need to use the products before 72 hours, consider washing the outside surfaces or wiping them with disinfectant. The contents of sealed containers won't be contaminated. After unpacking your groceries, wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Wipe surfaces on which you placed groceries while unpacking them with household disinfectants. Thoroughly rinse fruits and vegetables with water before consuming. And wash your hands before consuming any foods that you've recently brought home from the grocery store. What should and shouldn't I do during this time to avoid exposure to and spread of this coronavirus? For example, what steps should I take if I need to go shopping for food and staples? What about eating at restaurants, ordering takeout, going to the gym or swimming in a public pool?\n",
      "The answer to all of the above is that it is critical that everyone begin intensive social distancing immediately. As much as possible, limit contact with people outside your family. If you need to get food, staples, medications or healthcare, try to stay at least six feet away from others, and wash your hands thoroughly after the trip, avoiding contact with your face and mouth throughout. Prepare your own food as much as possible. If you do order takeout, open the bag, box or containers, then wash your hands. Lift, fork or spoon out the contents into your own dishes. After you dispose of these outside containers, wash your hands again. Most restaurants, gyms and public pools are closed; but even if one is open, now is not the time to go. Here are some other things to avoid: playdates, parties, sleepovers, having friends or family over for meals or visits, and going to coffee shops — essentially any nonessential activity that involves close contact with others.What can I do when social distancing? Try to look at this period of social distancing as an opportunity to get to things you've been meaning to do. Though you shouldn't go to the gym right now, that doesn't mean you can't exercise. Take long walks or run outside (do your best to maintain at least six feet between you and non-family members when you're outside). Do some yoga or other indoor exercise routines when the weather isn't cooperating. Kids need exercise too, so try to get them outside every day for walks or a backyard family soccer game (remember, this isn't the time to invite the neighborhood kids over to play). Avoid public playground structures, which aren't cleaned regularly and can spread the virus. Pull out board games that are gathering dust on your shelves. Have family movie nights. Catch up on books you've been meaning to read, or do a family read-aloud every evening. It's important to stay connected even though we should not do so in person. Keep in touch virtually through phone calls, Skype, video, and other social media. Enjoy a leisurely chat with an old friend you've been meaning to call. If all else fails, go to bed early and get some extra sleep! Should I wear a face mask? The CDC now recommends that everyone in the US wear nonsurgical masks when going out in public. Coronavirus primarily spreads when someone breathes in droplets containing virus that are produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes or when a person touches a contaminated surface and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth. But people who are infected but do not have symptoms, or have not yet developed symptoms, can also infect others. That's where masks come in. A person infected with coronavirus — even one with no symptoms — may emit aerosols when they talk or breathe. Aerosols are infectious viral particles that can float or drift around in the air. Another person can breathe in these aerosols and become infected with the virus. A mask can help prevent that spread. An article published in NEJM in March reported that aerosolized coronavirus could remain in the air for up to three hours. What kind of mask should you wear? Because of the short supply, people without symptoms or without exposure to someone known to be infected with the coronavirus can wear a cloth face covering over their nose and mouth. They do help prevent others from becoming infected if you happen to be carrying the virus unknowingly. While N95 masks are the most effective, these medical-grade masks are in short supply and should be reserved for healthcare workers. Some parts of the US also have inadequate supplies of surgical masks. If you have a surgical mask, you may need to reuse it at this time. But never share your mask. Surgical masks are preferred if you are caring for someone who has COVID-19 or you have any respiratory symptoms (even mild symptoms) and must go out in public.Masks are more effective when they are tight-fitting and cover your entire nose and mouth. They can help discourage you from touching your face (be sure you're not touching your face more often to adjust the mask). Masks are meant to be used in addition to, not instead of, physical distancing. The CDC has information on how to make, wear, and clean nonsurgical masks. The WHO offers videos and illustrations on when and how to use a mask. Is it safe to travel by airplane? Stay current on travel advisories from regulatory agencies. This is a rapidly changing situation. Anyone who has a fever and respiratory symptoms should not fly if at all possible. Even if a person has symptoms that feel like just a cold, he or she should wear a mask on an airplane. Is there a vaccine available? No vaccine is available, although scientists will be starting human testing on a vaccine very soon. However, it may be a year or more before we even know if we have a vaccine that works. Can a person who has had coronavirus get infected again? While we don't know the answer yet, most people would likely develop at least short-term immunity to the specific coronavirus that causes COVID-19. However, that immunity could want over time and you would still be susceptible to a different coronavirus infection. Or, this particular virus could mutate, just like the influenza virus does each year. Often these mutations change the virus enough to make you susceptible, because your immune system thinks it is an infection that it has never seen before.Will a pneumococcal vaccine help protect me against coronavirus? Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, only help protect people from these specific bacterial infections. They do not protect against any coronavirus pneumonia, including pneumonia that may be part of COVID-19. However, even though these vaccines do not specifically protect against the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, they are highly recommended to protect against other respiratory illnesses.My husband and I are in our 70s. I'm otherwise healthy. My husband is doing well but does have heart disease and diabetes. My grandkids' school has been closed for the next several weeks. We'd like to help out by watching our grandkids but don't know if that would be safe for us. Can you offer some guidance?\n",
      "People who are older and older people with chronic medical conditions, especially cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and lung disease are more likely to have severe disease or death from COVID-19, and should engage in strict social distancing without delay. This is also the case for people or who are immunocompromised because of a condition or treatment that weakens their immune response.The decision to provide on-site help with your children and grandchildren is a difficult one. If there is an alternative to support their needs without being there, that would be safest.Can my pet infect me with the virus that causes COVID-19?At present, there is no evidence that pets such as dogs or cats can spread the COVID-19 virus to humans. However, pets can spread other infections that cause illness, including E. coli and Salmonella, so wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after interacting with pets.What can I do to keep my immune system strong?Your immune system is your body's defense system. When a harmful invader — like a cold or flu virus, or the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 — gets into your body, your immune system mounts an attack. Known as an immune response, this attack is a sequence of events that involves various cells and unfolds over time.\n",
      "Following general health guidelines is the best step you can take toward keeping your immune system strong and healthy. Every part of your body, including your immune system, functions better when protected from environmental assaults and bolstered by healthy-living strategies such as these:Don't smoke or vape.Eat a diet high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.Take a multivitamin if you suspect that you may not be getting all the nutrients you need through your diet.Exercise regularly.Maintain a healthy weight.Control your stress level.Control your blood pressure. If you drink alcohol, drink only in moderation (no more than one to two drinks a day for men, no more than one a day for women).Get enough sleep.Take steps to avoid infection, such as washing your hands frequently and trying not to touch your hands to your face, since harmful germs can enter through your eyes, nose, and mouth. Should I go to the doctor or dentist for nonurgent appointments? During this period of social distancing, it is best to postpone nonurgent appointments with your doctor or dentist. These may include regular well visits or dental cleanings, as well as follow-up appointments to manage chronic conditions if your health has been relatively stable in the recent past. You should also postpone routine screening tests, such as a mammogram or PSA blood test, if you are at average risk of disease. Many doctor's offices have started restricting office visits to urgent matters only, so you may not have a choice in the matter. As an alternative, doctor's offices are increasingly providing telehealth services. This may mean appointments by phone call, or virtual visits using a video chat service. Ask to schedule a telehealth appointment with your doctor for a new or ongoing nonurgent matter. If, after speaking to you, your doctor would like to see you in person, he or she will let you know.What if your appointments are not urgent but also don't fall into the low-risk category? For example, if you have been advised to have periodic scans after cancer remission, if your doctor sees you regularly to monitor for a condition for which you're at increased risk, or if your treatment varies based on your most recent test results? In these and similar cases, call your doctor for advice. Should I postpone my elective surgery?It's likely that your elective surgery or procedure will be canceled or rescheduled by the hospital or medical center in which you are scheduled to have the procedure. If not, then during this period of social distancing, you should consider postponing any procedure that can wait.That being said, keep in mind that \"elective\" is a relative term. For instance, you may not have needed immediate surgery for sciatica caused by a herniated disc. But the pain may be so severe that you would not be able to endure postponing the surgery for weeks or perhaps months. In that case, you and your doctor should make a shared decision about proceeding.Preventing the spread of the coronavirus\n",

      "The CDC has said we need to prepare for a widespread COVID-19 outbreak. How? With novel coronavirus outbreaks popping up throughout the world, U.S. health officials on Tuesday (Feb. 25) advised the American public to prepare for an epidemic in which the virus rapidly spreads to many people within a short window of time.\"Now's the time for businesses, hospitals, community schools and everyday people to begin preparing,\" Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said in a news conference held Feb. 25. With no vaccine or treatment available to combat these infections, Americans must be prepared to take other precautions to protect themselves and their communities from the virus, she said.\"If we're not able to hold the line in the next week or two, you're going to start seeing a lot more cases,\" said Dr. George Rutherford, a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California, San Francisco. But what can you do, personally, to prepare for an impending viral outbreak? Live Science talked to several experts about how to prepare for coronavirus in the US. Here are some tips:Practice good hygiene and health habits.Wash your hands often and thoroughly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer (with at least 60% to 95% alcohol).Cover your coughs and sneezes with an elbow sleeve or tissue. Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth, as you can pick up the virus that way. Clean frequently touched surfaces and objects like doorknobs and countertops. Evidence suggests that disinfectants with 62% to 71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite (bleach) can \"efficiently\" inactivate coronaviruses within a minute, though it's not yet known how the new coronavirus reacts to these products, Live Science previously reported.Get the flu shot if you haven't already! Although the seasonal flu vaccine cannot protect you from COVID-19 directly, you may be more likely to develop severe pneumonia if you contract both diseases simultaneously, The New York Times reported. By avoiding the flu, you may also avoid making a trip to the doctor in the middle of a COVID-19 epidemic, when health care workers may be overwhelmed with other patients. Be prepared to stay home.Talk with your employer about what the company's work-from-home and sick leave policy might be in the event of an outbreak.Schools may be closed in your area during an outbreak. Ask your child's school, local school board or health department about how much advance notice there might be preceding a closure. Plan for how you will handle child care if schools and day care centers are closed.Large group gatherings may be canceled, including concerts, religious services and public events. Keep up with local announcements to find out about those cancellations.If you or someone in your household regularly takes prescription drugs, it may be wise to ask your health care and insurance providers about procuring an emergency supply.Make a plan for how to care for those at greater risk of serious illness and hospitalization, such as those over 65 years old and those with preexisting health conditions. Also have a backup plan for who will care for your dependents if you get sick, personally. Make sure you have reasonable amounts of groceries and other basic household necessities, such as laundry detergent. However, it's a balance: \"On the one hand, your chance of exposure will be minimal if you stay home, but if the cost of that is runs on grocery stores and having nothing available, that's a problem,\" Rutherford said.Check in with your neighbors and loved ones. Talk with your neighbors to check in on their health status and see how you can help each other if one of you is home sick or caring for others. Share the newest information from local health authorities, and make sure others are up to date.What to do if you or a household member has symptoms of COVID-19.If you are experiencing high fever, weakness, lethargy, or shortness of breath or have underlying conditions, you should seek medical attention at the nearest hospital, according to Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. \"The older you are, the shorter the fuse you should have for seeking care,\" Rutherford added. Infants should also be taken to a health care center if they have a fever or are breathing rapidly.\n",
      "Health care centers may establish triage tents or separate entrances for those with suspected COVID-19 infections, Adalja said. It may be wise to call ahead to learn if this is the case, and what you should do when you get to the hospital.If you live with an infected person, you may be asked to voluntarily quarantine yourself at home to prevent the possible spread of the infection to others, according to the Seattle Public Health Insider.If you have to leave your home (to seek medical care, for example), wearing a medical face mask can help reduce your chance of infecting others. If you don't have a mask, make sure to cover your coughs and sneezes with an elbow sleeve or tissue.What to do if you are healthy, but have to go outside in an affected area. Wearing a standard medical mask can't protect you from COVID-19, as they are not designed to lock out viral particles, Live Science previously reported. However, if you suspect you may have been exposed to the virus, you might consider wearing a mask as a courtesy to others. In crowded spaces, creating distance between yourself and others can help reduce your risk of person-to-person infection, according to the Seattle Public Health Insider. Officials recommend standing at least 3 feet away from nearby persons, but if an epidemic proves more severe, the recommended distance may be increased.A US coronavirus outbreak is almost inevitable.

      "What you need to know about how the virus is transmitted.A delicate but highly contagious virus, roughly one-900th the width of a human hair, is spreading from person to person around the world. The coronavirus, as it’s known, has already infected more than 200000 people in 140 countries.Because this virus is so new, experts’ understanding of how it spreads is limited. They can, however, offer some guidance about how it does — and does not — seem to be transmitted.If I cross paths with a sick person, will I get sick, too?You walk into a crowded grocery store. A shopper has the coronavirus. What puts you most at risk of getting infected by that person?Experts agree they have a great deal to learn, but four factors are likely to play some role: how close you get; how long you are near the person; whether that person projects viral droplets on you; and how much you touch your face. (Of course, your age and health are also major factors.)\n",
      "Also, the larger the number of people in the store — or in any other situation —  the greater the chance that you’ll cross paths with an infected person, which is why so many health officials are now urging people to avoid crowds and to cancel gatherings large and small.What’s a viral droplet?It is a droplet containing viral particles. A virus is a tiny codependent microbe that attaches to a cell, takes over, makes more of itself and moves on to its next host. This is its “lifestyle,” said Gary Whittaker, a professor of virology at the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine.A “naked” virus can’t go anywhere unless it’s hitching a ride with a droplet of mucus or saliva, said Kin-on Kwok, a professor at the Jockey Club School of Public Health and Primary Care at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.These mucus and saliva droplets are ejected from the mouth or the nose as we cough, sneeze, laugh, sing, breathe and talk. If they don’t hit something along the way, they typically land on the floor or the ground. When the virus becomes suspended in droplets smaller than five micrometers — known as aerosols — it can stay suspended for about a half-hour, research suggests.   To gain access to your cells, the viral droplets must enter through the eyes, the nose or the mouth. Some experts believe that sneezing and coughing are most likely the primary forms of transmission. Professor Kwok said talking face-to-face or sharing a meal with someone could pose a risk.Julian Tang, a virologist and a professor at the University of Leicester in England who is researching the coronavirus with Professor Kwok, agreed.“If you can smell what someone had for lunch — garlic, curry, etc. — you are inhaling what they are breathing out, including any virus in their breath,” he said.The virus does not linger in the air at high enough levels to be a risk to most people. But the techniques health care workers use to care for sick people can generate high levels of aerosols. This is part of why it’s so important that they have proper protective equipment.How close is too close?The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends keeping a distance of six feet from other people to minimize the possibility of infection. (A useful way to think about six feet is that it’s roughly twice the length of the average person’s extended arm.Three feet is the distance the W.H.O. emphasizes as particularly risky when standing near a person who is coughing or sneezing.Still, other public health experts say that at this crucial moment, when the world still has an opportunity to slow the transmission of the coronavirus, any number of feet is too close. By cutting out all but essential in-person interactions, we can help flatten the curve, they say, keeping the number of sick people to levels that medical providers can manage.How long is too long to be near an infected person?It’s not yet clear, but most experts agree that more time equals more risk.Will you know a person is sick?Not necessarily.Fever, coughing, chest pain and shortness of breath may signal that someone has been infected with the coronavirus. (Covid-19 is the name for the disease caused by the virus.But it has become increasingly clear that people without symptoms can also infect others. In some cases, these people may later feel terrible enough to try to get tested, isolate themselves, seek treatment and notify friends and colleagues about potential risk. In still other cases, people with the virus may never experience the physical discomfort that would tip them off to the fact that they have been a danger to others.  Can the virus last on a bus pole, a touch screen or other surface?Yes. After numerous people who attended a Buddhist temple in Hong Kong fell ill, the city’s Center for Health Protection collected samples from the site. Restroom faucets and the cloth covers over Buddhist texts tested positive for the coronavirus, the agency said.This coronavirus is just the latest of many similarly shaped viruses. (Coronaviruses are named for the spikes that protrude from their surfaces, which resemble a crown or the sun’s corona.A recent study of the novel coronavirus found that it could live for three days on plastic and steel. If you are ordering lots of supplies online, you may be relieved to know that the virus did poorly on cardboard — it disintegrated over the course of a day.  It survived for about four hours on copper.Whether a surface looks dirty or clean is irrelevant. If an infected person sneezed and a droplet landed on a surface, a person who then touched that surface could pick it up. How much is required to infect a person is unclear.But as long as you wash your hands before touching your face, you should be OK, because viral droplets don’t pass through skin.Also, coronaviruses are relatively easy to destroy. Using a simple disinfectant on a surface is nearly guaranteed to break the delicate envelope that surrounds the tiny microbe, rendering it harmless, Professor Whittaker said.Does the brand or type of soap you use matter?No, several experts said.My neighbor is coughing. Should I be worried?There is no evidence that viral particles can go through walls or glass, said Dr. Ashish K. Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute.He said he was more concerned about the dangers posed by common spaces than those posed by vents, provided there is good air circulation in a room.\n",
      "An infected neighbor might sneeze on a railing and if you touched it, “that would be a more natural way to get it from your neighbor,” he said.Can I get it from making out with someone?Kissing could definitely spread it, several experts said.Though coronaviruses are not typically sexually transmitted, it’s too soon to know, the W.H.O. said.Is it safe to eat where people are sick with the coronavirus?If a sick person handles the food or it’s a high-traffic buffet, then risks cannot be ruled out — but heating or reheating food should kill the virus, Professor Whittaker said.Dr. Jha concurred.“As a general rule, we haven’t seen that food is a mechanism for spreading,” he said.Can my dog or cat safely join me in quarantine?Thousands of people have already begun various types of quarantines. Some have been mandated by health officials, while others are voluntary and primarily involve staying home.Can a cat or dog join someone to make quarantine less lonely?Professor Whittaker, who has studied the spread of coronaviruses in animals and humans, said that he had seen no evidence that people who have the virus could be a danger to their pets.Surfaces?

      "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is raising levels of anxiety worldwide: both appropriate anxiety in reaction to real dangers and maladaptive panic. Beyond handwashing, a key public health directive is social distancing, which entails avoiding public gatherings and generally keeping physical distance from others. The economy is shutting down, leaving people at home without the structure of their daily work routine. The closing of theatres, museums, restaurants, and bars has disrupted and diminished social life. Rapid shifts in information (and misinformation) about a previously unknown pathogen amplify ongoing uncertainty and anxiety. Social distancing seems to mean increasing social isolation while worrying about a potentially lethal illness. Isolation can easily translate to loss of social support, particularly for individuals who live alone; and loss of social support often compounds symptom severity.The current crisis is transforming both our society and our practice. This situation has large implications for psychotherapy, and perhaps particularly for interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT). Overnight, psychotherapy has changed from in-person treatment to teletherapy, which maintains the therapist–patient alliance despite the emotional and hygienic distancing of a computer or smartphone screen. Teletherapy is functional, but is not exactly like being in the same room with another person. In IPT, we generally aspire to have patients look up from their screens to make eye contact, but now we distance. Now talking heads might be the safest substitute for personal encounters.Whereas other treatments like psychodynamic psychotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy have intrapsychic targets, IPT focuses on the interpersonal arena. IPT therapists usually encourage patients to interact with others. Social contact is already a challenge for depressed and anxious patients, and it has just become far more complicated. It is not a good time to join a social group or meet new individuals. So how should therapists handle the current crisis? Recent virtual supervisions and treatments have offered the following suggestions.Address reality. The first step is to acknowledge the extraordinary situation. To strengthen the therapeutic alliance, therapists can be clear that we would rather meet in person, but that in this public health emergency that is not a good idea. The therapist might want to privately recognise his or her countertransference, which might well include relief at avoiding infection by maintaining a distance. The message to the patient, however, needs to convey that the therapist will stay in touch and continue working to help the patient get better, the crisis notwithstanding. Indeed, isolated patients need a lifeline now more than ever. Try to maintain a regular schedule, and have the patient find a space where he or she will not be overheard or interrupted. It is important to try to use Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-approved media to make eye contact through the screen. Give the patient your full empathic attention; do not take notes during sessions. The therapeutic alliance could have particular potency in a time of crisis.Social support. Similarly, the patient's social interaction presents a dilemma. It is important to make the most of social engagement given the limitations of the moment, to maintain social bonds, and to seek interpersonal support even as one must maintain a safe physical distance. Social engagement—attachment—is a basic human need. At a time when developing new relationships might be hard, taking a good interpersonal inventory can identify existing relationships that the patient can use to minimise isolation. The phone, FaceTime, Skype, and the like can help to lessen social isolation and maintain social support. Failing that strategy, more isolated individuals might want to use social media to maintain a sense of connection with others.Because most new therapies require in-person intake visits, a patient you terminate with is unlikely to be able to start new treatment elsewhere. Hence, even if you were planning to terminate a time-limited treatment with a patient, it might be appropriate—depending upon clinical status—to add continuation sessions to a treatment you would normally end, in order to ensure the patient's continuity of care.Every cloud has a silver lining. Objectively, this situation is a terrible moment in world history, and not one to trivialise to patients. From a therapeutic stance, however, bad news can be good news. IPT therapists capitalise on environmental stressors and losses—the death of a significant other (complicated bereavement), a painful interpersonal situation (role dispute), or other major life event (role transition)—as helpful explanations for why patients are feeling the way they do, contextualising those feelings and symptoms in a current personal crisis that the patient can work on and resolve in time-limited treatment.A pandemic can helpfully be reframed as a role transition in which the patient needs to mourn the (hopefully temporary) loss of old roles and to adaptively restructure activities and relationships in the present. Forty years ago, another frightening and initially untreatable virus with very different course, stigma, and social reverberations struck. Because the news was so bad, IPT proved particularly efficacious in treating HIV-related major depression, and might have similar potency today.This setting is a painful but powerful moment for psychotherapy. Patients need therapy more than ever, yet are physically distanced from it. Psychotherapy might be harder in some respects to do at a distance, but teletherapy does work, and the basic principles remain the same. The interpersonal, environmental context can provide a useful frame for treating the problems patients now face.JM reports personal fees from Oxford University Press, American Psychiatric Publication, and Basic Books; and support from a grant from the Bob Woodruff Foundation, outside the submitted work.Virtual treatment and social distancing\n",

      "Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people, and others cause illness in certain types of animals. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the new strain of coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19. Sometimes coronaviruses that infect animals can evolve and make people sick and become a new human coronavirus. Three recent examples of this are SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV.The media has reported that some people are seeking “alternative” remedies to prevent or to treat COVID-19. Some of these purported remedies include herbal therapies, teas, essential oils, tinctures, and silver products such as colloidal silver. There is no scientific evidence that any of these alternative remedies can prevent or cure the illness caused by COVID-19. In fact, some of them may not be safe to consume.12 It’s important to understand that although many herbal or dietary supplements (and some prescription drugs) come from natural sources, “natural” does not always mean that it’s a safer or better option for your health. For tips on how to find accurate, reliable information about health, visit our Know the Science resources. While scientists at NIH and elsewhere are evaluating candidate therapies and vaccines to treat and prevent the novel coronavirus, currently there are no treatments or vaccines for COVID-19 infection approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Researchers are studying new drugs, and drugs that are already approved for other health conditions, as possible treatments for COVID-19. The best way to prevent infection is to avoid exposure to the virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also recommends everyday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of this and other respiratory viruses, including the following:Clean your hands often.Avoid close contact.Cover your mouth and nose with a cloth face cover when around others.Cover coughs and sneezes.Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces.Follow the instructions of your state and local authorities and current guidance regarding social distancing and other measures to reduce the spread of coronavirus.If you have a fever or cough, you might have COVID-19. Most people have mild illness and are able to recover at home. If you have traveled to high risk countries or regions or were in close contact with someone with COVID-19 or think you may have been exposed to COVID-19, contact your health care provider immediately.

      "Last week, a medical journal reported that a business traveler from China had infected at least one person in Germany with the spreading coronavirus even though she had no symptoms. It was decisive evidence that the virus could transmit undetected and a critical piece of information, one of the key factors U.S. officials weighed when formulating unprecedented quarantines and travel restrictions announced by health officials at the White House.\n",
      "Now, interviews with the woman have revealed a fundamental mistake in the report, which appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine. It turns out the woman did have symptoms while she was in Germany. They were “mild unspecific symptoms,” including back pain, for which she took a fever-reducing Tylenol-like drug, according to Marieke Degen, a spokeswoman for the Robert Koch Institute, a German research organization and governmental public health agency that was following up on the case.The revelation underscores how the urgency to make sweeping public health decisions about the spread of the coronavirus is clashing with the uncertainties surrounding a novel virus. The essential question public health experts are grappling with is how easily the virus spreads, particularly from people who have mild symptoms. Despite the error in the report from Germany, first reported by Science magazine, it’s still possible that people can spread it before they have symptoms. Public health measures that depend on isolating people who could transmit the virus could become difficult to implement if the virus spreads before people realize they have been infected.The new information could intensify an already challenging public health situation, experts said. The United States imposed wide-ranging quarantine and isolation measures that took effect Sunday, including barring non-U.S. citizens who recently visited from China from entering the United States. U.S. officials will also quarantine Americans who visited Hubei province, where the outbreak began, for 14 days.Hundreds of Americans were evacuated from Wuhan on a pair of U.S. charter flights that took off from the coronavirus hot zone Tuesday night, the State Department said. The passengers will arrive in the United States Wednesday and will be quarantined for 14 days on four military bases, U.S. officials said.\n",
      "“We can’t isolate everyone who has a headache and took a Tylenol,” said Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. If there is spread of disease when someone is not yet showing signs of illness, “it becomes a considerably bigger public health challenge,” he said. “The isolation of ill cases would not be effective if there’s transmission to a considerable degree before people are really sick.”leaped on the error to inform the public on their website that the evidence the virus could spread without symptoms was not based on science. The World Health Organization issued a report saying it is “aware of possible transmission” before symptoms but noted that study is ongoing of the “few instances” in which it may have occurred.Nine countries outside China have confirmed 27 instances of human-to-human transmission of the infection, WHO officials said Tuesday during an executive board meeting at their headquarters in Geneva, a worrisome sign for containment of the disease.In China, cases continue to soar. Chinese officials on Tuesday reported a total of 20438 confirmed cases of infection — an increase of 3235 from Monday, the biggest daily jump since the National Health Commission began releasing statistics. Almost 3000 of the infected are in critical condition.WHO officials also presented additional information about symptoms of the disease, saying that 2 to 3 percent of patients also have gastrointestinal problems. The most common symptoms are fever and cough, officials have said.The WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency on Thursday and warned countries against imposing travel and trade restrictions on China. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus reiterated that call Tuesday, noting that 22 countries have reported such restrictions. The United States is one of them.“Such restrictions can have the effect of increasing fear and stigma, with little public health benefit,” he said. In countries that have imposed them, he called for them to be short, proportionate to the public health risks, and reassessed regularly.He chided “some high-income countries” with confirmed cases that are “well behind” in sharing complete data about their cases. “I don’t think it’s because they lack capacity,” he said. Without better data, it’s difficult for the WHO to assess how the outbreak is evolving or what impact it could have.Hong Kong became the second place outside mainland China to report a fatality, after China reported 425 deaths, bringing the overall toll to 427. A 39-year-old man who died had a preexisting condition and had traveled to Wuhan last month. He was hospitalized Friday.More infections were announced outside China, including six more in both Thailand and Singapore, suggesting that the virus is gaining steam internationally.In the United States, the top official at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention overseeing the coronavirus response has cited the NEJM report about asymptomatic transmission as one of several “worrisome data points” about a serious public health situation.“We are aware of the correction to the NEJM article on asymptomatic transmission, and the fact that this patient did have mild symptoms is consistent with what we know of other cases,” CDC spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund said Tuesday.She said the “enhanced response posture” of the federal government is based on “a dramatic increase in the number of cases reported, supporting efficient person-to-person spread, the geographic expansion of the outbreak, and continued reports of severe illness including those resulting in death.”Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who has often been the official called on by the past six presidents to explain outbreaks to the American public, said he still believes it is possible for the virus to spread from someone who is not showing symptoms. Fauci initially said the report had served as an important confirmation of rumors and anecdotes that had been filtering in from China, and he mentioned it at a White House briefing on Friday.“One of the problems with when the virus is transmitted in an asymptomatic way and has its implications — it puts a terrible burden on the screening process. How do you screen somebody?” Fauci said last week, when referencing the NEJM report. “You know, remember back with Ebola? Ebola doesn’t get transmitted unless you’re actively very ill, and you know that. It’s very, very clear.”Upon learning of the journal error, Fauci said he called a top public health official and scientist in Beijing who told him that the disease could spread without symptoms.“I think it’s a double-edged sword. I think it’s important to get information out quickly when you’re dealing with an emerging and evolving public health issue, but there is a danger in that, and we have just seen now a classic example of this danger,” Fauci said Tuesday. But he said his conversation made him confident that while the report was incorrect, the phenomenon it described is real.Patients often recall their symptoms differently when multiple people ask them, said Trish Perl, chief of infectious diseases and geographic medicine at UT Southwestern Medical Center, who has fought other respiratory virus outbreaks, including severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which also emerged in China and infected about 8000 people and killed nearly 800 between 2002 and 2003.“Stuff you might not consider a symptom, like a little bit of a runny nose, is something people kind of ignore,” she said.The information about the German case was published Thursday as a letter in the NEJM, which — like other scientific and medical journals — has promised to make emerging scientific information available rapidly. That speed has been praised because sharing information is essential in a public health emergency, but also opens the door for more errors.Julia Morin, a spokeswoman, said that the NEJM “is looking into the matter” but that the journal has not posted a correction or update. Degen, at the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin, said its researchers had submitted its findings, and “it is still open when (and in which journal) this will be scientifically published.” The main author of the letter did not immediately respond to questions about the report.The report could still have value, experts said, because it shows that a person with mild symptoms can transmit the illness initially.Lipsitch added that public policy should be flexible in the face of an emerging threat, to take into account information that may change or evolve. The travel restrictions announced by the White House late last week stated that policy should be reevaluated at least every 15 days.\n",
      "Lauren Ancel Meyers, a mathematical epidemiologist at the University of Texas at Austin, said she is gearing up to simulate scenarios in which the disease spreads in the United States to help with preparation and planning for countermeasures. But much depends on information that is still murky: how soon people can begin to spread the virus after contracting it, how readily it spreads and other factors.“There is so much uncertainty, and the information is changing every day about what is going on with the virus,” Meyers said.Key evidence for coronavirus spread is flawed as public health decisions loom\n",

      "The C.D.C. director says new data about people who are infected but symptom-free could lead the agency to recommend broadened use of masks.As many as 25 percent of people infected with the new coronavirus may not show symptoms, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns — a startlingly high number that complicates efforts to predict the pandemic’s course and strategies to mitigate its spread.In particular, the high level of symptom-free cases is leading the C.D.C. to consider broadening its guidelines on who should wear masks.“This helps explain how rapidly this virus continues to spread across the country,” the director, Dr. Robert Redfield, told a National Public Radio affiliate in Atlanta in an interview broadcast on Monday.The agency has repeatedly said that ordinary citizens do not need to wear masks unless they are feeling sick. But with the new data on people who may be infected without ever feeling sick, or who are transmitting the virus for a couple of days before feeling ill, Mr. Redfield said that such guidance was “being critically re-reviewed.”Researchers do not know precisely how many people are infected without feeling ill, or if some of them are simply presymptomatic. But since the new coronavirus surfaced in December, they have spotted unsettling anecdotes of apparently healthy people who were unwitting spreaders.“Patient Z,” for example, a 26-year-old man in Guangdong, China, was a close contact of a Wuhan traveler infected with the coronavirus in February. But he felt no signs of anything amiss, not on Day 7 after the contact, nor on Day 10 or 11.Already by Day 7, though, the virus had bloomed in his nose and throat, just as copiously as in those who did become ill. Patient Z might have felt fine, but he was infected just the same.Researchers now say that people like Patient Z are not merely anecdotes. For example, as many as 18 percent of people infected with the virus on the Diamond Princess cruise ship never developed symptoms, according to one analysis. A team in Hong Kong suggests that from 20 to 40 percent of transmissions in China occurred before symptoms appeared.The high level of covert spread may help explain why the novel coronavirus set off a pandemic in a way that the SARS and MERS viruses did not.The new virus spreads about as easily as flu, “and when’s the last time anyone thought anything about stopping influenza transmission, short of the vaccine?” said Dr. Michael T. Osterholm, an infectious disease expert at the University of Minnesota.With any vaccine still in early development, the best way to mitigate the pandemic is social distancing, he and other experts said. Because people may be passing the virus on to others even when they feel fine, asking only unwell people to stay home is unlikely to be enough. This is why many experts, going against recommendations by the C.D.C. and the World Health Organization, are now urging everyone to wear masks — to prevent those who are unaware they have the virus from spreading it.Like influenza, some experts now say, this virus appears to spread both through large droplets and droplets smaller than five micrometers — termed aerosols — containing the virus that infected people might release especially while coughing, but also while merely exhaling. They emphasized that the level of virus in both types of particles is low, so simply jogging or walking by an infected person does not put people at risk.“If you have a passing contact with an infectious person, you would have a very, very low chance of transmission occurring,” said Dr. Benjamin Cowling, an epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong.The risk goes up with sustained contact — during face-to-face conversation, for example, or by sharing the same air space for a prolonged time. In addition to its confusing stance on masks, “the W.H.O. has been saying aerosol transmission doesn’t occur, which is also perplexing,” Dr. Cowling said, adding, “I think both are actually wrong.”Experts agreed that infections were being passed along by people who do not report symptoms — what they call asymptomatic transmissions — but they also noted some confusion around the term.“There’s no standard definition for it, and you could say to yourself, Well, that’s kind of ridiculous: You either have symptoms or you don’t,” said Dr. Jeffrey Shaman, an infectious diseases expert at Columbia University. But studies by his team have shown, he said, that some people never notice their symptoms, others are unable to distinguish the infection from their smoker’s cough or allergies or other conditions, and still others may feel every pain acutely.There is also a largely semantic debate about what proportion of people who appear to be perfectly fine but then become ill — as in the report in The New England Journal of Medicine of an apparently asymptomatic spreader who later acknowledged having felt mild symptoms.Ultimately, Dr. Shaman said, these definitions are unimportant.“The bottom line is that there are people out there shedding the virus who don’t know that they’re infected,” he said.Where the definitions may matter is in being able to understand the true scope of the pandemic.Dr. Cowling’s team has analyzed data from China at various stages in the pandemic. The W.H.O.’s mission to China concluded that most people who were infected with the virus had significant symptoms. But in the early weeks of the epidemic, his analysis shows, China set a high bar for what constituted a confirmed case of infection — requiring respiratory symptoms, fever and a chest X-ray for pneumonia.Their definition left out mild and asymptomatic cases and, as a result, the team vastly underestimated the scale and nature of the outbreak there.“We’ve estimated in China that between 20 percent and 40 percent of transmission events occurred before symptoms appeared,” Dr. Cowling said.\n",
      "A separate analysis of the hundreds of people cloistered aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship bears out this scale. Once the ship docked in Japan on Feb. 5, researchers tested all of the passengers and reviewed those who tested positive for the virus on multiple occasions over a two-week period. They found that 18 percent of the infected passengers remained symptom-free throughout.“The substantial asymptomatic proportion for Covid-19 is quite alarming,” said Dr. Gerardo Chowell, an epidemiologist at Georgia State University who worked on the analysis.Dr. Chowell noted that the passengers on the ship tended to be older and therefore more likely to develop symptoms. He estimated that about 40 percent in the general population might be able to be infected without showing signs of it.There have also been many hints, subtle and not, that the virus can be transmitted via aerosols. Sixty members of a choir in Mount Vernon, Wash., north of Seattle, gathered on March 10 for a practice session for over two and a half hours. None of them felt ill, and they made no contact with one another. But by this weekend, dozens of the members had fallen ill, and two had died.Their experience points toward airborne transmission via aerosols, which can travel farther than the large droplets the W.H.O. and the C.D.C. have emphasized. The virus is still most likely to be expelled with a cough or a sneeze, as far as eight meters (about 26 feet), according to one study. But studies on influenza and other respiratory viruses, including other coronaviruses, have shown that people can release aerosols containing the virus simply by breathing or talking — or, presumably, by singing.“I think increasing evidence suggests the virus is spread not just through droplets but through aerosols,” Dr. Chowell said. “It would make a lot of sense to encourage at the very least face mask use in enclosed spaces including supermarkets.”Several studies have shown now that people infected with the new coronavirus are most contagious about one to three days before they begin to show symptoms. This presymptomatic transmission was not true of the coronaviruses that caused SARS and MERS.“This is where we got very lucky with SARS, was that it really didn’t transmit until after people were showing symptoms, and that made it much easier to detect it and shut it down with aggressive public health measures,” said Dr. Carl Bergstrom, an expert in emerging infectious diseases at the University of Washington in Seattle.With the new coronavirus, there is transmission by healthy-seeming people, and often severe symptoms and a high fatality rate. “That whole combination makes it very, very tough to fight using standard public health measures,” he said.A separate analysis from the C.D.C. on Tuesday offered new evidence that a significant portion of people with severe coronavirus infections in the United States have underlying medical conditions. The agency looked at 7162 cases, a small subset of the 122000 cases in the U.S., but the findings provided a stark portrait. Of 457 people in that subset who were admitted to intensive care units, 32 percent suffered from diabetes; 29 percent had heart disease; and 21 percent had lung disease. Overall, 78 percent of people with Covid-19 admitted to the I.C.U. had at least one pre-existing condition. The study did not look at deaths.Rapid tests for infection might help detect people, especially health care workers, who are infected yet feel normal. Masks may help. But experts kept returning to social distancing as the single best tool for stopping the chain of transmission in the long term — not lockdowns, necessarily, but canceling mass events, working from home when possible and closing schools.“We can’t assume that any of us are not potential vectors at any time,” Dr. Bergstrom said. “This is why even though I’m feeling great, and have felt great and haven’t been exposed to anybody with any symptoms of anything, that’s why it would be irresponsible of me to go out and about today.”Infected but Feeling Fine: The Unwitting Coronavirus Spreaders\n",

      "As countries around the world ease the lockdowns that have been crippling their economies, the race is on to develop smartphone apps to help contain the spread of the novel coronavirus when people are no longer confined to their homes.Scientists say contact tracing is key to prevent a resurgence of the virus, by tracking down infected people and finding everyone who has been near them, so they can get tested or quarantined.On Tuesday, Britain started testing its own COVID-19 tracing app on the Isle of Wight, off the south coast of England. It joins Australia, Israel, Singapore and other nations in rolling out such tools.But the tech race has raised privacy and accuracy concerns among rights groups and technology experts.And the question of whether the apps can deliver on their promise is a matter of debate, with researchers warning that mobile phones are no silver bullet against COVID-19.“A mobile app alone is not enough,” said Thomas Hardjono, chief technology officer for the Connection Science programme at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which has built its own app.Further research to better understand the virus and consistent testing efforts would be needed to complement any contact tracing app, he said. “It needs to be part of a bigger effort.”Worldwide, about 3.6 million people have been infected by the respiratory disease and more than 250000 have died, according to a Reuters tally.BEYOND TRADITIONAL TRACING. Contact tracing has been used for decades to control the spread of infectious diseases and is normally carried out by public health investigators who interview patients to find out who they have met and where they have been in the previous days.But with almost half of novel coronavirus transmissions occurring before symptoms appear, traditional methods are too slow to keep up, researchers say.\n",
      "A report published in April by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Maryland said the United States needed 100000 more contact tracers to effectively tackle the pandemic.Given the virus’ rapid spread, even a single day’s delay in contact tracing could be the difference between getting the virus under control and suffering a resurgence, according to researchers from the University of Oxford in Britain.Here is where health experts say apps can help.Smartphones keep track of their location via cell-tower signals, Wi-Fi signals and the satellite-based global positioning system, known as GPS.Through Bluetooth technology, which allows devices to connect to others nearby, phones can also log other phones that have come within a few metres of them.\n",
      "Using that data, contact tracing apps can instantly inform users if they have come into contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19, and advise them to call a doctor, get tested or self-isolate.DIGITAL HANDSHAKES.But the prospect of widespread data collection worries some citizens and civil rights groups like European Digital Rights.The use of GPS and other geolocation data could provide authorities with a detailed map of a user’s every movement, leaving the door open to abuse, said Diego Naranjo, head of policy at the digital civil rights group.“That gives (authorities) a very accurate description of your reality and who you are ... it should be avoided at all costs,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.If the data were to become public, people at risk of infection could face discrimination and the places they visited become ostracized, privacy activists say.\n",
      "Apps that work only through Bluetooth could offer more privacy protections because they amass less information, collecting only data about who people meet but not where they are, said Naranjo.Yet, issues remain around who can view a phone’s list of the devices it has connected with, known as “handshakes”.Some states favour storing all the data on a central server, while others prefer a system in which Bluetooth logs would be kept on individual devices.Centralised systems are easier to design and manage and would allow health authorities access to more information, but privacy advocates say they could also expose millions of people’s personal data to hacks and leaks.“Decentralised is the best option,” said Naranjo. “It gives more power to the individual and diminishes the risk.”NO ALTERNATIVE.Contact tracing apps are also not foolproof, tech and biology experts have warned.GPS or cell tower location data can wrongly record everyone on a busy city block as contacts.Similarly, Bluetooth can log phones that are near each other but separated by walls, although developers have been working on ways to better define “contacts” based on the length and strength of the handshakes between devices.Apps also do not take into account whether users who have been in contact with others were wearing protective equipment at the time, according to researchers from the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think tank.This raises the possibility of an app flagging someone as being in danger of infection even if, in reality, the risk is minimal, the researchers say.“There is a real risk that these mobile-based apps can turn unaffected individuals into social pariahs, restricted from accessing public and private spaces or participating in social and economic activities,” they wrote in an article last month.Another challenge is take up, with some epidemiologists saying at least 40% of a country’s population needs to activate digital contact tracing for the system to be effective.In Singapore, only about one in five people have downloaded a government-backed Bluetooth-based contact tracing app since it launched in March.\n",
      "About 12% of Australians have so far installed a similar app that was launched last week.And a poll released in April by the Washington Post and the University of Maryland found more than half of all Americans either do not own smartphones or would not use the contact tracing app being developed by tech giants Google and Apple.Yet, even with all their limitations, apps could still prove useful - if only because there is no alternative, said Hardjono of MIT.“Right now, this is all we have,” he said.Digital handshake: Can contact tracing deliver on its promise in coronavirus battle?\n",

      "More than one million people around the world are known to have recovered from coronavirus, according to Johns Hopkins University. But the road back to full health is not the same for everyone.Recovery time will depend on how sick you became in the first place. Some people will shrug off the illness quickly, but for others it could leave lasting problems.Age, gender and other health issues all increase the risk of becoming more seriously ill from Covid-19.Are ethnic minorities being hit hardest by coronavirus?How does coronavirus affect children?Coronavirus: What is the risk to men over 50?The more invasive the treatment you receive, and the longer it is performed, the longer recovery is likely to take.What if I have only mild symptoms?Most people who get Covid-19 will develop only the main symptoms - a cough or fever. But they could experience body aches, fatigue, sore throat and headache.The cough is initially dry, but some people will eventually start coughing up mucus containing dead lung cells killed by the virus.These symptoms are treated with bed rest, plenty of fluids and pain relief such as paracetamol.People with mild symptoms should make a good and speedy recovery.The fever should settle in less than a week, although the cough may linger. A World Health Organization (WHO) analysis of Chinese data says it takes two weeks on average to recover.What if I have more serious symptoms?The disease can become much more serious for some. This tends to happen about seven to 10 days into the infection.The transformation can be sudden. Breathing becomes difficult and the lungs get inflamed. This is because although the body's immune system is trying to fight back - it's actually overreacting and the body experiences collateral damage.Some people will need to be in hospital for oxygen therapy.GP Sarah Jarvis says: \"The shortness of breath may take some considerable time to improve... the body is getting over scarring and inflammation.\"She says it could take two to eight weeks to recover, with tiredness lingering.What if I need intensive care?The WHO estimates one person in 20 will need intensive care treatment, which can include being sedated and put on a ventilator.It will take time to recover from any spell in an intensive or critical care unit (ICU), no matter what the illness. Patients are moved to a regular ward before going home.Dr Alison Pittard, Dean of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, says it can take 12 to 18 months to get back to normal after any spell in critical care.\n",
      "Spending a long time in a hospital bed leads to muscle mass loss. Patients will be weak and muscle will take time to build up again. Some people will need physiotherapy to walk again.Because of what the body goes through in ICU, there's also the possibility of delirium and psychological disorders.\n",
      "\"There does seem to be an added element with this disease - viral fatigue is definitely a huge factor,\" says Paul Twose, critical care physiotherapist at Cardiff and Vale University Health Board.There have been reports from China and Italy of whole-body weakness, shortness of breath after any level of exertion, persistent coughing and irregular breathing. Plus needing a lot of sleep.\"We do know patients take a considerable period, potentially months, to recover.\"But it is hard to generalise. Some people spend relatively short periods in critical care, while others are ventilated for weeks.Will coronavirus affect my health long-term?We don't know for sure as there is no long-term data, but we can look at other conditions.Acute respiratory distress syndrome (called Ards) develops in patients whose immune systems go into overdrive, causing damage to the lungs.\"There is really good data that, even five years down the line, people can have ongoing physical and psychological difficulties,\" says Mr Twose.Dr James Gill, a GP and lecturer at Warwick Medical School, says people also need mental health support to improve recovery.\"You're finding breathing difficult, then the doctor says 'We need to put you on a ventilator. We need to put you to sleep. Do you want to say goodbye to your family?'.\"PTSD [post-traumatic stress disorder] in these most severe patients is not unsurprising. There will be significant psychological scars for many.\"There remains the possibility that even some mild cases may leave patients with long-term health problems - such as fatigue.How many people have recovered?Getting an accurate figure is difficult.As of 1 May, Johns Hopkins University reported more than 1021000 people had recovered out of 3.2 million people known to have been infected around the world.But countries use different recording methods. Some are not publishing recovery figures and many mild infections will be missed.Mathematical models have estimated between 99-99.5% of people recover.Can I catch Covid-19 again?There has been much speculation, but little evidence, on how durable any immunity is. If patients have successfully fought off the virus, they must have built up an immune response.Reports of patients being infected twice may just be down to tests incorrectly recording they were free of the virus.The immunity question is vital for understanding whether people can be reinfected and how effective any vaccine may be.\n",

      "Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that can cause illnesses such as the common cold, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). In 2019, a new coronavirus was identified as the cause of a disease outbreak that originated in China.The virus is now known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease it causes is called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic.Public health groups, including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and WHO, are monitoring the pandemic and posting updates on their websites. These groups have also issued recommendations for preventing and treating the illness.Symptoms.Signs and symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may appear two to 14 days after exposure. This time after exposure and before having symptoms is called the incubation period. Common signs and symptoms can include:Fever.Cough. Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. Other symptoms can include:Tiredness.Aches.Chills.Sore throat.Loss of smell.Loss of taste.Headache.Severe vomiting.The severity of COVID-19 symptoms can range from very mild to severe. Some people may have only a few symptoms, and some people may have no symptoms at all. People who are older or who have existing chronic medical conditions, such as heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, severe obesity, chronic kidney or liver disease, or who have compromised immune systems may be at higher risk of serious illness. This is similar to what is seen with other respiratory illnesses, such as influenza.Some people may experience worsened symptoms, such as worsened shortness of breath and pneumonia, about a week after symptoms start.When to see a doctor.If you have COVID-19 symptoms or you've been in contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19, contact your doctor or clinic right away for medical advice. Tell your health care team about your symptoms and possible exposure before you go to your appointment.If you have emergency COVID-19 signs and symptoms, seek care immediately. Emergency signs and symptoms can include:Trouble breathing.Persistent chest pain or pressure. New confusion.Blue lips or face.If you have signs or symptoms of COVID-19, contact your doctor or clinic for guidance. Let your doctor know if you have other chronic medical conditions, such as heart disease or lung disease. During the pandemic, it's important to make sure health care is available for those in greatest need.Causes.Infection with the new coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).The virus appears to spread easily among people, and more continues to be discovered over time about how it spreads. Data has shown that it spreads from person to person among those in close contact (within about 6 feet, or 2 meters). The virus spreads by respiratory droplets released when someone with the virus coughs, sneezes or talks. These droplets can be inhaled or land in the mouth or nose of a person nearby.It can also spread if a person touches a surface with the virus on it and then touches his or her mouth, nose or eyes.Risk factors.Risk factors for COVID-19 appear to include:Recent travel from or residence in an area with ongoing community spread of COVID-19 as determined by CDC or WHO. Close contact with someone who has COVID-19, , such as being within 6 feet, or 2 meters, or being coughed on — which can occur when a family member or health care worker takes care of an infected person.Complications.Although most people with COVID-19 have mild to moderate symptoms, the disease can cause severe medical complications and lead to death in some people. Older adults or people with existing chronic medical conditions are at greater risk of becoming seriously ill with COVID-19.Complications can include:Pneumonia in both lungs.Organ failure in several organs.Respiratory failure.Heart problems, such as heart rhythm problems and a disease of the heart muscle that makes it hard for your heart to pump blood to the body (cardiomyopathy).Acute kidney injury.Additional viral and bacterial infections. Prevention. Although there is no vaccine available to prevent COVID-19, you can take steps to reduce your risk of infection. WHO and CDC recommend following these precautions for avoiding COVID-19:Avoid large events and mass gatherings.Avoid close contact (within about 6 feet, or 2 meters) with anyone who is sick or has symptoms.Stay home as much as possible and keep distance between yourself and others (within about 6 feet, or 2 meters) if COVID-19 is spreading in your community, especially if you have a higher risk of serious illness. Keep in mind some people may have COVID-19 and spread it to others, even if they don't have symptoms or don't know they have COVID-19.Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.Cover your face with a cloth face covering in public spaces, such as the grocery store, where it's difficult to avoid close contact with others, especially if you're in an area with ongoing community spread. Only use nonmedical cloth masks — surgical masks and N95 respirators should be reserved for health care providers.\n",
      "Cover your mouth and nose with your elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw away the used tissue.Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.Avoid sharing dishes, glasses, bedding and other household items if you're sick.Clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces daily.Stay home from work, school and public areas if you're sick, unless you're going to get medical care. Avoid taking public transportation if you're sick.If you have a chronic medical condition and may have a higher risk of serious illness, check with your doctor about other ways to protect yourself.Travel. If you're planning to travel, first check the CDC and WHO websites for updates and advice. Also look for any health advisories that may be in place where you plan to travel. You may also want to talk with your doctor if you have health conditions that make you more susceptible to respiratory infections and complications.Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)\n",

      "There is no cure for COVID-19. A vaccine is being developed, but it will be some time before it is available. Different medicines are being tested to see whether they can help patients with COVID-19. The research is in the early stages, so these medicines are normally. only given as part of a clinical trial. A drug called remdesivir may be used in patients who have severe COVID-19. Other drugs that are being investigated are called chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and lopinavir/ritonavir. Another treatment is being developed from the blood of people who have recovered from COVID-19. Their blood contains proteins called antibodies, which can stick to the virus that causes COVID-19 and help to fight the infection. This treatment is called convalescent plasma.Hospital treatment. The treatment for someone with COVID-19 is the same as for pneumonia or any other serious viral chest infection.If you are treated in hospital, the treatment will consist of: rest, making sure you get plenty of fluids, possibly through an IV (intravenous) drip, medication to lower fever and reduce pain, if needed oxygen, if you need it, and close monitoring. You might also be given antibiotics to begin with, in case you have a bacterial infection. But if testing shows that you have a viral infection, the antibiotics will be stopped, as antibiotics don’t work against viruses.People with severe symptoms might be treated in an intensive care unit (ICU). If you need to be treated in intensive care, your treatment might also include:a tube passed through your mouth to your windpipe, called an endotracheal tube, and a ventilator to support your breathing. Some people being treated in hospital might also need treatment for sepsis.Home treatment.In most countries, people who are seriously ill would probably be isolated and treated in hospital.But if someone has mild symptoms of suspected COVID-19, they can probably be looked after at home until they can be tested. For example, in the UK, people who have symptoms are advised not to go to hospital right away, but to stay at home and contact their health authorities, and to follow their advice. This will help stop the spread of the virus.The guidance for looking after them at home is as follows: They should be looked after in a well ventilated room by themselves, and should stay in that room as much as possible, so that they don’t spread the infection. The number of people who look after the ill person should be limited to as few as possible. Ideally, anyone looking after the ill person should be in good health.If you wear a medical mask while looking after someone with symptoms, change it for a new one if it comes into contact with their bodily fluids.Wash your hands thoroughly after touching the ill person. You might want to wear disposable gloves, such as latex gloves.Dispose carefully of any tissues the person uses. Don’t share anything like towels or bedclothes with the ill person. Carefully wash any plates, drinking glasses and cutlery after they use it. Regularly wipe and disinfect any surfaces the person touches regularly, such as bedside tables.Clean toilet and bathroom surfaces regularly.Clean all clothes, bedclothes, and towels used by the ill person at 60 to 90° C. The ill person should limit contact with pets and other animals. At this time, there is no evidence that pets and other animals can spread COVID-19 but caution is advised. Cats. can become infected with coronavirus after contact with people who have COVID-19.Scientists are carrying out research in this area too. Keep taking any prescribed medications, unless your doctor recommends that you stop.The advice might change as we find out more about this virus and how it spreads.If you are looking after someone who might have COVID-19 at home, your whole household might need to stay in isolation for up to 14 days, to reduce the risk of passing on the infection.If you are not sure what to do, contact your doctor for advice.What will happen?It’s not possible to say what will happen to someone infected with COVID-19. The outcome can vary. What we know so far is that: the infection is most likely to be serious in older people with existing long-term health problems. But most people with COVID-19 don't become seriously ill, about 80 in 100 people with COVID-19 have a mild illness, about 20 in 100 people develop more severe symptoms, most people who become ill are middle aged and older, but some young adults have become very ill as well, children are much less likely than adults to become ill, but a few children do become very ill, men are more likely than women to become severely ill. The best thing you can do is to follow the advice about travel restrictions, other prevention measures and about what to do if you feel ill. This will help to protect you and the people around you. During the COVID-19 pandemic, doctors have noticed that fewer people are coming to hospital with serious illnesses like heart attacks or cancers. If you feel unwell, even if you don’t think you have COVID-19, it is very important to get help. Hospitals are still open for other emergencies.If you usually do a lot of exercise, you should rest for at least two weeks after recovering from COVID-19 or testing positive for coronavirus. You should speak to your doctor about when you can start exercising again.What treatments work?\n",
