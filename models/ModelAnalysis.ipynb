      "The breakdown of the global liberal world order and its foundations. What is happening now is a global breakdown of the world order. It does not matter at all whether the nature of the coronavirus is artificial or not, nor is it even of principal importance whether, if it is artificial, it was deliberately released by the “world government” or not. The epidemic has begun - it is a fact. Now the main thing is to trace how the \"world government\" has reacted to it.To clarify, the \"world government\" is the totality of global political and economic elites and the intellectuals and media (mediacrats) that serve them. Such a \"world government\" necessarily exists, because on a global scale there are strictly-defined, fundamental norms that determine the basic parameters of politics, economics and ideology.In the economy, the only recognized norm is capitalism, the market economy (which is disputed only by North Korea - not, and this is very important, by China, which presents its own version of national state capitalism under the management of the Communist Party).In politics the only recognized norm is parliamentary liberal democracy, based on civil society being the subject and source of legality and legitimacy (besides North Korea, almost everyone is in agreement with this, although China interprets \"civil society\" in a special socialist and partly national-cultural optic and carries out mediacratic screening by means other than direct parliamentary elections; and some Islamic states - for example, Iran and the Gulf monarchies - have a number of special features. In ideology, everyone agrees with the arrangement that any individual has a number of inalienable rights (to life, freedom of conscience, freedom of movement, etc.) which all states and societies are obliged to guarantee.In essence, these are the three basic principles of the global world that emerged after the collapse. of the USSR and the victory of the capitalist West in the Cold War. The main players in politics, economics and ideology are concentrated in Western countries, which set the model for others. This is the core of the \"world government\". Inside this government, China is beginning to play an increasingly important role, towards which the elite of Russia and all other states are rushing.\n",
      "Whether the coronavirus is artificial is not so important. It does not matter whether the coronavirus was produced artificially and deliberately used by the \"world government\" in this sense.But it is this world, under the umbrella of such a \"world government” with all three of its axiomatic foundations, that is collapsing before our very eyes. This is reminiscent of the end of the socialist camp, the bipolar world and the USSR, but then one of two worlds disappeared, while one remained and extended its rules to all others including its yesterday's opponents. Gorbachev himself wanted to get into the \"world government\" without dissolving the USSR, but he was not accepted. Nor were the pro-Western leaders of the Russian Federation who surrendered to the West accepted. They still are not. And now, today, this very \"world government\" is collapsing. Could it have voluntarily opted for liquidation? Hardly. But it reacted to the coronavirus as if to something inevitable, and this was a choice.There was freedom on whether or not to recognize the coronavirus as existing. And by the very fact of its recognition of the pandemic, the \"world government\" signed its own death sentence. Did it do so consciously? No more (or no less) consciously than Gorbachev in Perestroika. In the case of the USSR, one pole disappeared, while the other remained. Today the end of planetary liberal democracy means the end of everything. This system has no other paradigm - except for North Korea (which is still a pure anachronism, albeit a very interesting one) or China’s compromised version.Who should have defeated the coronavirus and how?The coronavirus has already struck a blow from which neither politics, economics, nor ideology will recover. The pandemic would have to have been dealt with by the existing institutions, in normal mode without changing the basic rules neither in politics (meaning no quarantine, no forced isolation, let alone a state of emergency);nor in the economy (no remote work, no stopping of production, exchanges and financial- industrial institutions or trading platforms, no vacation, etc.);nor in ideology (no restrictions, albeit temporary on essential civil rights, freedom of movement, the cancellation or postponement of elections, referenda, etc.).but all of this has already happened on a global scale, including in Western countries, i.e., in the territory of the \"world government\" itself. The very foundations of the global system have been suspended.This is how we see the ongoing situation. For the \"world government\" to take such a step, it had to be forced to do so. By whom? After all, there simply cannot be any higher instance of authority than modern materialistic, atheistic and rationalistic humanity.\n",
      "Liberalism as the final result of New Time. Let us postpone this question for later and now look at the larger historical trajectory of the modern liberal-democratic global system, that is, the government of the \"liberal political elites\" (parliamentarism), major economic players (oligarchs and transnational monopolies), the ideologists of the \"open society\" and the journalists who serve them (including moderators of sentiments on social networks and the Internet). The source of this system should be sought in the end of the Renaissance and in the “New Time” (early Modernity) that emerged therefrom, which saw a fundamental break with the Middle Ages with regard to the subject of power and, consequently, to its very nature. In the Middle Ages and in the society of Tradition overall, the legitimacy and legality of the political model of society were based on the transcendent - superhuman, divine - factor. The supreme subject of power and law was God, His revelations and the laws and settings established by Him, as well as those institutions which were considered to be his representatives on Earth: in the Christian world, these were the Church and the monarchical state. The New Time of Modernity abolished this vertical and set itself the goal of building a society on earthly foundations. Thus the main subject and source of legitimacy and legality became man, and the \"celestial government\" - the \"supra-world government\" - gave way to the \"earthly government\". Politics, economy and ideology changed accordingly: democracy,capitalism and civil society emerged.For several centuries, these principles fought against the old (medieval) order until the last empires - the Russian, Ottoman, Austrian and German - fell in the 20th century. However, liberal democracy still had to cope with such heretical (from the liberal point of view) versions of Modernity as communism and fascism, which in their own ways interpreted \"civil society” and the human being as such: the former in class optics and the latter in national or racial terms. In 1945, the Communists and Liberals jointly ended fascism, and in 1991 the Communists fell. The liberals were the only ones left, and henceforth the \"world government\" turned from a plan into nearly a reality, as all countries and societies have recognized the standards of democracy, the market, and human rights. This is what Francis Fukuyama meant in his book The End of History and the Last Man. The history of this New Time began when the goal was set to replace the celestial subject with the earthly one, and it ended when this replacement was accomplished on a global scale.The end of the liberal world and its parallels with the end of the USSR. Today, instead of the end of history, that is, instead of the total triumph of liberal democracy, world capitalism and the ideology of the \"open society\" (rights of the human as an individual), we have collapsed into completely new conditions overnight. This is as unexpected as the end of the USSR. Even after 1991, many people could not believe that the Soviet system had disappeared, and some cannot even realize it now. Of course, the end of globalism was sensed by some critical thinkers: it was spoken of by conservatives, and the sharp rise of China, which represents a special model of globalism, Putin's refusal to cede power to the manipulable and controllable (as the West thought) Medvedev in 2012, and perhaps most importantly, Brexit and the rise of populism, could all be considered clear signs that, despite its proximity to the final point, globalism has not only been unable to effectively achieve the “end of history”, but is beginning to paradoxically move away from it. On a philosophical level, the postmodernists began to reflect on this, loudly proclaiming that something was wrong with Modernity.But history has no other way left: it must either move forward along the inertia which it has over the past few centuries, since New Time and the Enlightenment, or collapse. Everyone believed that somehow everything would resolve itself, and that the only thing that mattered was to effectively confront those who were categorized as the \"enemies of open society”, i.e., Putin, Iran, Islamic fundamentalism, or the new rise of nationalist movements rapidly responding to the crisis of mass migration. In general, no one thought of an alternative, even consciously ruling out such. And that is why, in the moment of serious crisis, the global liberal system has failed and collapsed. Almost no-one has understood this yet, but it has already happened. And it has happened irrevocably. Coronavirus, by its very fact and especially by the way in which it has been responded to by the \"world government\", has become the end of the modern world.The end of \"the Ego and Its Own\"Does this mean that humanity will die? This is still unknown, but it cannot be ruled out. One can only guess whether it will perish or not. But what can already be said with certainty is that the global world order based on capitalism, liberal democracy and the principles of the sovereign individual (civil society, the open society) has already perished. It is gone, it has collapsed, although desperate efforts will still be undertaken to save it for some time to come. How they will be deployed and how long they will last is not crucial now. It cannot be ruled out that it will disappear altogether like smoke, just like the Soviet system dissolved in thin air.That which just a second ago was, was fleeting, as if it never was. It is much more important to look at what is coming to replace the old world order.\n",
      "The most important thing to understand is that it is not merely a technical failure in the system of global governance that has happened, but rather the resulting, final element of the entire historical process of Modernity, of New Time, over the course of which power was transferred from the celestial subject to the earthly one, and this subject itself - through the ideological and political battles of the last centuries, including the world hot and cold wars - moved towards a certain crystallization, that of parliamentary democracy, the global capitalist market and the individual endowed with rights. The whole system of modern global capitalism is built on the premise of \"the Ego and its Own\" (Max Stirner). The political rights of the \"Ego\" (the individual in complete isolation from nation, race, religion, sex, etc.) were fixed and entrenched in the global systems of political democracy. Economic rights were embodied in the norms of private property and market mechanisms. Thus, the source of political power reached its imminent limit: in liberalism and globalism, the last hints of verticality and “transcendence\" which had been preserved still at the first stages of Modernity, in particular the structures of the state, were eliminated. Hence the globalist aspiration to abolish the sovereignty of the state and transfer its powers to the supranational level, thus legalizing the \"world government\", which de facto already exists. In other words, the political, economic, and ideological history of New Time moved towards a quite definite end, in which the purely human, immanent, individual subject would be finally formed and laid as the basis for political legitimization. Little was left to chance: the complete abolition of states which took place on the level of the European Union was to be repeated on a global scale.The cancelled finale of liberalism. This final moment, to which everything was headed, today is not merely postponed indefinitely, but is altogether cancelled. If political history could not reach this point without the coronavirus, then the whole process collapsed in the face of this epidemic. In order to effectively counteract the epidemic, the authorities of nearly all countries, including those of the West, have introduced compulsory quarantine with strict measures for its violation, or have outright declared emergency situations. The economic mechanisms of the global market have collapsed due to closure of borders, as have stock exchanges and financial institutions. The open society and unhindered migration have come into direct contradiction with basic sanitary standards. In fact, a dictatorial regime has rapidly been established all over the world, under which power has been transferred to a completely new entity. Neither \"the Ego\", nor \"its Own\", nor all of the world's giant superstructures that guaranteed their legal and legitimate rights and statuses are any longer considered the source of political power. What Giorgio Agamben has called the \"naked life\", i.e., the absolutely special, physical survival imperative that has nothing to do with the logic of liberal capitalism, has come to the foreground. Neither equality, rights, law, private property, collective decision-making, the system of mutual obligations, nor any other fundamental principle of liberal democracy has real power. Only those mechanisms that contribute to survival, to stopping infection and providing for the simplest, purely physiological, needs, are important now.But this means that the subject of power is radically changing. It is no longer the free society, nor the market, nor the humanist presumptions of the sovereign individual, nor guarantees of personal freedom and private life. All of this is to be sacrificed if the matter at hand is physical survival. Political rights are abolished, economic obligations are abolished, total surveillance and strict disciplinary control become the only overriding social norm.If the \"world government\" has gone into a state of emergency, proved unable to or did not even dare to bypass it, or was simply forced to accept it, then this means that the paradigm which just yesterday seemed to be unshakeable has been abandoned. And in this case, there is either no \"world government\" at all, and every society saves itself as it can, or the fundamental paradigm abruptly changes and turns into something else. Both in the first and in the second cases, the former order has collapsed, and something new is being built before our very eyes.Such radical conclusions are not just related to the scale of the pandemic, which is not even so great yet. Much more important is the perception of the epidemic by the power elites, who have so quickly and easily abandoned their seemingly inviolable foundations. That is the most fundamental thing. The measures aimed at combating the coronavirus have already undermined the foundations of liberal democracy and capitalism, rapidly abolishing the subject of power itself. From now on, the \"ego and its own\" is no longer the basis of legality and legitimacy: under the conditions of the State of Emergency, power is being transferred to another authority. Something new is becoming the bearer of sovereignty.So what is it?The coronavirus as the ruling subject: the secular gods of the plague. On the one hand, it could be said that the coronavirus itself (the virus has its \"royal\" name for a reason) is demonstrating a status unique to that of the subject. To better understand this, we can recall the ancient plague gods, who were considered formidable deities in the religious beliefs of the peoples of the Middle East. The peoples of Mesopotamia had Erra, Nergal, and others, and in the monotheistic traditions, in particular in Judaism, plagues were sent by the supreme deity, Yahweh, to punish the Jews for idolatry. In the Middle Ages, epidemics and plagues were considered signs of divine punishment. Traditional society can justifiably give the status of subjectivity to large-scale phenomena or link them to the divine element. However, in the New Time of Modernity, man held himself to be the complete master of life, hence the development of modern medicine, drugs, vaccines, etc. Therefore, it is as if the complete inability of governments to counteract the coronavirus today is casting mankind beyond the edge of New Time. But the God or gods to whom the modern virus plague could be ascribed and left to no longer exist. The modern world is convinced that the virus must have earthly, material and immanent origin. But what kind of materiality is stronger than man? Hereby arise the many conspiracy theories linking the origin of the virus to malefactors aspiring to establish their control over mankind. For the philosophers of \"speculative realism,\" who for decades have been thinking about the need to replace humanity with a system of objects - whether Artificial Intelligence or cyborgs - the virus itself might very well be granted the status of sovereign actor, a kind of hyperobject (a la Morton) capable of subjugating the masses of beings to its will, as does mold, the rhizome, and so on. In other words, the collapse of the liberal model brings to the forefront the hypothesis of the post-human, post-humanist actor.Coronavirus, whose Latin name literally means “the crowned poison”, is thus (at least theoretically) a contender for the center of the new world system. If the main concern of mankind from now on will be to counteract the virus, fight against it, protect against it, etc., then the whole system of values, rules and guarantees will be rebuilt according to absolutely new principles and priorities. Speculative realists go even further and are ready to recognize in the hyperobject the presence of infernal entities of the ancient gods of chaos emerging out of the bottom of existence, but it is not necessary to go that far, insofar as, if we simply assume that\n",
      "political, economic and ideological rationality will henceforth be built around the counteraction of contagious viruses, we will live in a different - for example, in a hygienocentric - world, organized in a completely different way than the modern world. The \"Ego\", \"its Own\" and all the structures which guarantee them predictability, stability and protection, which elevate them to the status of the foundations of legality and legitimacy, will fall into the background, while the coronavirus or its analogue will establish a different hierarchy, a different political and economic ontology, a different ideology.The state vs. coronavirus. But which state?If we look at how the fight against coronavirus is unfolding today, we can notice an abruptly sharp increase in the role of the state, which over the course of globalization was considerably relegated to the back-burner. It is at the level of the state that decisions on quarantine, self- isolation, travel bans, restrictions on freedoms and economic measures, are being made. In fact, everywhere in the world - whether openly or by default - a state of emergency has been declared. According to the classics of political thought, and in particular Carl Schmitt, this means the establishment of a regime of dictatorship. The sovereign, according to Schmitt, is he who makes the decision in an emergency situation (Ernstfall), and today this is the state. However, it should not be forgotten that today’s state has until the altogether recent last moment been based on the principles of liberal democracy, capitalism, and the ideology of human rights. In other words, this state is, in some sense, deciding on the liquidation of its own philosophical and ideological basis (even if such are for now formalized, temporary measures, the Roman Empire still began with the temporary dictatorship of Caesar, which gradually became permanent). Thus, the state is rapidly mutating, just as the virus itself is mutating, and the state is following the coronavirus in this constantly evolving struggle, which is taking the situation ever further from the point of global liberal democracy. All the extant borders which until yesterday seemed to be erased or half-erased are once again gaining fundamental meaning - not only for those who are going to cross them, but also for those who simply have managed in time to return to their country. At the same time, in larger countries this fragmentation is being carried over to individual regions, where states of emergency are leading to the establishment of their own, regional dictatorships, which in turn will be strengthened as communication with the center becomes more difficult. Such fragmentation will continue all the way down to small towns and even individual households, where forced closure will open up new horizons and volumes of domestic violence.The state is taking upon itself the mission of fighting the coronavirus under certain conditions, but is waging this fight in already different circumstances. Over the course of this mission, all state institutions related to law, legality and economy are being transformed. Thus, the very introduction of quarantine completely overturns the logic of the market, according to which only the balance of supply and demand and the agreements concluded between employer and employee can regulate the relations between them. Bans on working for hygienic reasons are irrevocably collapsing the entire construction of capitalism. The suspension of freedom of movement, assembly and democratic procedures is blocking the institutions of political democracy and paralyzing individual freedoms.Post-liberal dictatorship. Over the course of this epidemic, a new state is emerging which is beginning to function with new rules. It is very likely that in the process of the state of emergency there will be a shift of power from formal rulers to technical and technological functionaries, e.g., the military, epidemiologists, and institutions especially created for such extreme circumstances. The physical threat which the virus poses to leaders is forcing them to be placed in special conditions that are not always compatible with full control over situations. As legal norms are suspended, new algorithms of behavior and new practices are beginning to be deployed. Thus is born the dictatorial state, which, unlike the liberal-democratic state, has completely different goals, foundations, principles and axioms. In this case, the \"world government\" is dissolved, because any supranational strategy loses all meaning. Power is rapidly moving to an ever lower level - but not to society and not to citizens, but to the military-technological and medical-sanitary level. A radically new rationality is gaining force - not the rationale of democracy, freedom, the market and individualism, but that of pure survival, for which responsibility is assumed by a subject combining direct power and the possession of technical, technological, and medical logistics. Moreover, in the network society, such is based on a system of total surveillance excluding any kind of privacy.Thus, if at one end we have the virus as the subject of transformation, then at the other end we have military-medical surveillance and punitive dictatorship fundamentally differing in all parameters from the state that we knew until yesterday. It is not at all guaranteed that such a state, in its fight against the secular \"plague gods”, will precisely coincide with the borders of existing national entities. Since there will be no ideology or politics beyond the straightforward logic of survival, centralization itself will lose its meaning and its legitimacy.From civil society to \"naked life”. Here once again let us recall the \"naked life\" of Giorgio Agamben, who in a similar vein and based on Schmitt's ideas on the \"state of emergency\" analyzed the situation in Nazi concentration camps, where the dehumanization of people attained the extreme, under which the \"naked life\" revealed itself. The “naked life” is not human life, but some other life that is beyond the limits of self-consciousness, personality, individuality, rights, and so on. Hence why Agamben has been more radical than others and opposed the measures taken against the coronavirus, preferring even death to the introduction of a state of emergency. He clearly saw that even a small step in this direction will change the entire structure of the world order. Entering the stage of dictatorship is easy, but exiting it is sometimes impossible.The \"naked life” is the victim of the virus. It is not people, families, citizens, or private owners. Here there is neither one nor many. There is only the fact of infection, which can turn anyone - including oneself - into an other, and therefore into the enemy of \"naked life.” And it is fighting this other, \"naked life\" that grants dictatorship the new status of the subject. Then, society itself, at the mercy of dictatorship, will be turned into “naked life” organized by the dictatorship in accordance with its own peculiar rationality. Out of fear of the coronavirus, people are ready to go for any of the steps of those who have taken upon themselves responsibility for the state of emergency.Thus, the fundamental split between the healthy and the sick, considered by Michel Foucault in his book \"Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison”, becomes even more impassable of a line than all the oppositions of the classical ideologies of Modernity, e.g., between the bourgeoisie and proletariat, the Aryans and Jews, the liberals and “enemies of the open society”, etc., and will see its dividing line set between the poles of the “naked life” and “medical technologists”, who have in their hands all the instruments of violence, surveillance, and authority. The difference between the already sick and the not yet sick which at first justified the new dictatorship will be erased, and the dictatorship of virologists, which has built new legitimacy on the basis of this distinction, will create a completely new model.\n",
      "The new dictatorship is neither fascism nor communism. This situation will seem to many to be reminiscent of fascism or communism, but these parallels are imaginary. Both fascism and communism represented types of “civil society”, albeit totalitarian ones, with pronounced ideologies which guaranteed civil rights - not to all, but to the significant and, de facto, overwhelming majority of their citizens. Liberalism, by reducing all identities down to the level of the individual, paved the way and created the preconditions for a special type of post-liberal dictatorship that, unlike communism and fascism, should have no ideology at all, insofar as it will have no reason to persuade, mobilize, or \"seduce\" the element of the “naked life\". The \"naked life” is already consciously ready to surrender to dictatorship, regardless of what it promises or insists on. The structures of such a dictatorship will be built on the basis of the fact that it opposes the virus, not on the basis of ideas and preferences. The military-medical hygienic dictatorship will be characterized by a post-liberal logic, for which the only operation will be rational treatment of the \"naked life\", the bearers of which have no rights at all and no identity. This order will be built along the infected vs. healthy watershed, and this dual code will be as powerful as it is obvious, with no need for any justification or argumentation.Artificial Intelligence and its enemies. Here the following consideration comes to mind: in the carriers of such a post-liberal anti-virus dictatorship, we see virtually no properly human traits. Any humanity would only hinder the most effective operation on the \"naked life\", and would thus represent a restless, trembling,survival-at-all-costs-seeking chaos. Consequently, Artificial Intelligence, abstract mechanical calculation, would cope best with this task. In military-medical dictatorship we see a distinct cybernetic dimension, something machine-like and mechanical. If the \"naked life\" is chaos, then there must be a cold mathematical order at the other pole. And from now on, its only legitimization will be not the consent of society, which loses everything but its survival instinct, but the very criterion of its ability to make balanced logical decisions without being affected by superfluous emotions and passions. Therefore, even if a military-medical hygienic dictatorship is established by people, sooner or later its main bearers will be machines.There will be no return Several conclusions can be drawn from this very preliminary analysis of the near future - the future that has already begun:It is impossible to go back to the world order that existed only recently and which seemed so familiar and natural that no one thought about its ephemerality. Liberalism either did not reach its natural end and the establishment of a \"world government\", or nihilistic collapse was its original goal, merely covered by increasingly less convincing and increasingly perverse \"humanist\" decor. Proponents of philosophical \"accelerationism\" speak of \"Black Enlightenment,\" emphasizing this dark, nihilistic aspect of liberalism as representing merely the accelerated movement of man toward the abyss of post-humanism. But in any case, instead of \"world government\" and total democracy, we are entering an era of new fragmentation, of \"closed societies\" and radical dictatorship, perhaps exceeding Nazi concentration camps and the Soviet gulag.The end of globalization will not mean, however, a simple transition to the Westphalian system, to realism and a system of closed trade states (Fichte). Such would require the well- defined ideology that existed in early Modernity, but which was completely eradicated in late Modernity, and especially in Postmodernity. The demonization of anything remotely resembling “nationalism” or “fascism” has led to the total rejection of national identities, and now the severity of the biological threat and its crude physiological nature makes national myths superfluous. The military-medical dictatorship does not need additional methods to motivate the masses, and moreover, nationalism only enhances the dignity, self-consciousness and civil feeling of society which contradict the rules of the \"naked life\". For the society to come, there are only two criteria - healthy and sick. All other forms of identity, including national ones, have no meaning. Approximately the same was true for communism, which was also a motivating ideology that mobilized the consciousness of citizens to build a better society. All these ideologies are archaic, meaningless, redundant and counterproductive in the fight against coronavirus. Therefore, it would be wrong to see any \"new fascism\" or \"new communism\" in the impending post-liberal paradigm. It will be something else. It cannot be ruled out that this new stage will affect so greatly the life of humankind or what will remain of it that, having passed through all these trials and tribulations, mankind will be ready to accept any form of power, any ideology, and any order that will weaken the terror of the Artificial Intelligence-military-medical dictatorship. And then, in a cycle, we cannot rule out a return to the project of \"world government\", but this will already be on a completely different basis, because society will be irreversibly changed over the period of “quarantine\". It will no longer be the choice of \"civil society\", but the cry of \"naked life”, which will recognize any authority that can offer deliverance from the horror that has occurred. This would be the right time for what Christians call the \"Antichrist\" to appear.Exaggeration and the liquidation of leaders Is such an analytical forecast too much of a dramatized exaggeration? I think it is quite realistic, although, of course, \"nobody knows the time\", and in any situation everything might be postponed for some time. The epidemic could end abruptly and a vaccine will be found. But all that has alPANDEMIC AND THE POLITICS OF SURVIVAL: THE HORIZONS OF A NEW TYPE OF DICTATORSHIP\n",

      "The global coronavirus pandemic has huge geopolitical implications. The world will never be the same again. However, it is premature to talk about what kind of world it will end up being. The epidemic has not passed: we have not even reached the peak. The main unknowns remain the following:how many losses will humanity suffer in the end - how many deaths?who will be able to stop the spread of the virus and how?what will be the real consequences for those who fell ill and for those who survived?No one can yet answer these questions, even roughly, and therefore we cannot even remotely imagine what the real damage will be. In the worst case, the pandemic will lead to a serious drop in the world population. At best, panic will prove premature and unfounded. But even after the first months of the pandemic, some global geopolitical changes are already quite evident and largely irreversible. No matter how the events that follow will develop, something in the world order has changed once and for all.The outbreak of the coronavirus epidemic represents a decisive moment in the destruction of the unipolar world and the collapse of globalization. The crisis of unipolarity and the breakdown of globalization have been evident since the beginning of the 2000s - the catastrophe of September 11, the strong growth of the Chinese economy, the return to Putin's Russia's global politics as an increasingly sovereign entity , the strong mobilization of the Islamic factor, the growing migration crisis and the rise of populism in Europe and even in the United States, which led to the election of Trump and many other parallel phenomena, made it clear that the world formed in the nineties around the predominance of the West, the United States and global capitalism has entered a phase of crisis. The multipolar world order begins to form with new central actors, civilizations, as anticipated by Samuel Huntington [Cfr. Aleksandr Dugin, Multipolar World Theory , AGA Editrice, 2019, NdT]. But in the face of the signs of an emerging multipolarity, one thing is a trend, another is objective reality. It is like ice cracked in the spring - it is clear that it will not last long, but at the same time, it is undeniable that you can also move on it, even if you run some risk. Nobody can be sure when the cracked ice will actually give up.Now we can start a countdown to a multipolar world order and the starting point is the coronavirus epidemic. The pandemic has buried globalization, open society and the global capitalist system. The virus forced us on ice and the individual enclaves of humanity began to take their own isolated historical trajectories.Coronavirus has buried all the major myths of globalization:the effectiveness of open borders and the interdependence of countries in the world,the ability of supranational institutions to cope with an extraordinary situation,the sustainability of the global financial system and the global economy as a whole, facing serious challenges, the futility of centralized states, socialist regimes and disciplinary methods in solving acute problems and the total superiority of liberal strategies towards them,\n",
      "- the total triumph of liberalism as a panacea for all problematic situations.Their solutions have not worked in Italy, nor in other European Union countries, nor in the United States. The only thing that proved effective was the clear closure of society, dependence on internal resources, the strong power of the state and the isolation of the sick from the healthy, citizens from foreigners, etc.At the same time, Western countries also reacted to the pandemic in a very different way: the Italians introduced the total quarantine, Macron introduced a state dictatorship regime (in the Jacobin spirit), Merkel has allocated 500 billion euros to support the population, and Boris Johnson, following the spirit of Anglo-Saxon individualism, suggested that the disease should be considered a private matter affecting every English taken individually and refused to perform the swab tests, sympathizing in advance with those who lose loved ones. Trump established a state of emergency in the United States, closing connections with Europe and the rest of the world. If the West acts in such a disparate and contradictory way, what will become of the rest of the countries? Everyone seems to be saved as they can. This goal was best achieved by China, which, thanks to the practical policies of the Communist Party, established strict disciplinary methods to combat contagion, accusing the United States of spreading it. The same accusation was made by Iran, which was hit hard by the virus - even among the leaders of the country.Thus, the virus tore open society to pieces and pushed humanity forward on its path to a multipolar world.Regardless of how the fight against coronavirus will end, it is clear that globalization has collapsed. This could almost certainly mark the end of liberalism and its total ideological domination. It is difficult to predict the final version of the future world order - especially in its details. Multipolarism is a system that historically has never existed, and if we look for some remote analogy, we should not turn to the era of the more or less equivalent European states according to the Westphalian world, but to the period before the era of the Great Geographical Discoveries, when, together with Europe (divided into western and eastern Christian countries), the Islamic world, India, China and Russia existed as independent civilizations. The same civilizations existed in the pre-colonial period in America (the Incas, the Aztecs, etc. ) and in Africa. There were links and contacts between these civilizations, but there was no single type of link with universal values, institutions and systems.The post coronavirus world is likely to include individual regions of the world, civilizations, continents that are gradually transforming themselves into independent actors. At the same time, the universal model of liberal capitalism is likely to collapse. This model currently serves as the common denominator of the whole structure of unipolarity: from the absolutization of the market to parliamentary democracy and the ideology of human rights, including the notion of progress and the law of technological development which have risen to the rank of dogma in the 'Europe  New Age  (of the New Times) and have spread to all human societies through colonization (directly or indirectly in the form of westernization).Much will depend on who defeats the epidemic and how: where disciplinary measures prove effective, they will enter the future political and economic order as an essential component. The same conclusion can be reached by those who, on the other hand, will not be able to face the threat of a pandemic through the opening and absence of severe measures. Temporary alienation dictated by the direct threat of contagion from another country and from another region, the breakdown of economic ties and the necessary alienation from a single financial system will force the states affected by the epidemic to seek self-sufficiency, because the priority will be food security, minimum autonomy and economic autarchy to meet the vital needs of the population, beyond any economic dogma considered mandatory before the coronavirus crisis. Even where liberalism and capitalism are preserved, they will be placed in a national framework in the spirit of mercantilist theories that insist on maintaining the monopoly of foreign trade in the hands of the state. Those who are less tied to the liberal tradition can very well move in the areas of the most optimal organization of the \"great space\" in other directions - taking into account the civilizational and cultural specificities.\n",
      "It cannot be said in advance what the multipolar model as a whole will eventually become, but the very fact of breaking the universally binding dogma of liberal globalization will open up completely new opportunities and paths for each civilization.After the coronavirus: multipolar security. The multipolar world will create a completely new security architecture. It may not be more sustainable or adaptable to conflict resolution, but it will be different. In this new model, the West, the United States and NATO, if NATO still exists, will be only one factor among others. The United States itself will clearly not be able (and probably will not, if Trump's line eventually prevails in Washington) to play the role of sole global arbiter, and therefore the United States will acquire a different status after the quarantine and emergency state. It can be compared to Israel's role in the Middle East. Israel is undoubtedly a powerful country, which actively influences the balance of power in the region, but does not export its ideology and values ​​to the surrounding Arab countries. On the contrary, it retains its Jewish identity for itself, rather trying to free itself from readers of other values ​​rather than include them in its composition. The construction of a wall with Mexico and Trump's invitation to the Americans to focus on their internal problems is similar to Israel's path: the United States will be a powerful power, but its liberal-capitalist ideology will have value are for themselves , without attracting third parties. The same will apply to Europe. As a result, the most important factor in the unipolar world will radically change its status. The construction of a wall with Mexico and Trump's invitation to the Americans to focus on their internal problems is similar to Israel's path: the United States will be a powerful power, but its liberal-capitalist ideology will have value are for themselves , without attracting third parties.

The same will apply to Europe. As a result, the most important factor in the unipolar world will radically change its status.This, of course, will lead to a redistribution of forces and functions among other civilizations. Europe, if it maintains its unity in some way, is likely to create its own military blockade independent of the United States, which has already been mentioned after the collapse of the Soviet Union (the Eurocorps project  ) and to which Macron and Merkel have repeatedly mentioned. While not directly hostile to the United States, such a blockade will in many cases pursue purely European interests, which at times may differ significantly from those of the United States. This will primarily affect relations with Russia, Iran, China and the Islamic world.China will have to transform itself from the beneficiary of globalization and adapt to pursue its national interests as a regional power. This is exactly what all the processes in China are heading towards lately - the strengthening of Xi Jianping's power, the \"One Belt One Road\" project, etc. It will no longer be a globalization with Chinese characteristics, but a project explicitly focused on the Far East with peculiar Confucian and partly socialist characteristics. Clearly, conflicts in the Pacific Ocean with the United States will worsen at some point.The Islamic world will face a difficult problem linked to the new paradigm of self-organization, since in the conditions of formation of the great spaces - Europe, China, USA, Russia, etc. - the individual Islamic countries will not be fully commensurate with the rest and effectively defend their interests. There will be a need for several Islamic integration poles - Shiites (with the center in Iran) and Sunnis, where, together with Indonesia and Pakistan in the east, a western Sunni bloc will probably be built around Turkey and some Arab countries such as Egypt or the Gulf States.And finally, in the multipolar world order, Russia will have the historical possibility of strengthening itself as an independent civilization that will see its power increase following the strong decline of the West and its internal geopolitical fragmentation. But, at the same time, this will also represent a challenge: before establishing itself fully as one of the most influential and powerful poles of the multipolar world, Russia will have to pass the test of maturity, preserving its unity and reaffirming its areas of influence in the Eurasian space. It is not yet clear where the southern and western borders of Russia-Eurasia will be post coronavirus. This will largely depend on what regime, what methods and efforts Russia will use to deal with the pandemic and what political consequences this will have. Moreover, it is impossible to predict with cognition the state of the other \"great spaces\" - the poles of the multipolar world. The establishment of the Russian perimeter will depend on many factors, some of which may prove to be rather acute and conflicting.Gradually, a multipolar settlement system will be formed - both based on a UN reformed under the conditions of multipolarity, and in the form of some new organization. Again, it will all depend on how the fight against coronavirus will unfold.The virus as a mission. Without pretense: the coronavirus pandemic represents a turning point in world history. Not only are stock indices and oil prices plummeting, the world order itself is also plummeting. We live in the period that marks the end of liberalism and its \"obviousness\" as a global meta-narrative, the end of its dispositions and standards. Human societies will soon become freely floating: no more dogmas, no more imperialism than the dollar, no more spells of the free market, no more dictatorship than the Fed or global stock exchanges, no more enslavement to the world media elite. Each pole will build its future on its civilization foundations. It is obviously impossible to say what this will look like or what it will bring. However,What neither ideologies, nor wars, nor bitter economic conflicts, nor terror, nor religious movements have been able to do, has been accomplished by an invisible but deadly virus. It brought with it death, suffering, horror, panic, pain ... but also the future.THE CORONAVIRUS AND THE HORIZON OF A MULTIPOLAR WORLD: THE GEOPOLITICAL POSSIBILITIES OF THE EPIDEMIC\n",

      "Last year a mysterious shipment was caught smuggling Coronavirus from Canada. It was traced to Chinese agents working at a Canadian lab. Subsequent investigation by GreatGameIndia linked the agents to Chinese Biological Warfare Program from where the virus is suspected to have leaked causing the Wuhan Coronavirus outbreak.Note: The findings of this investigation has been corroborated by none other than the Bioweapons expert Dr. Francis Boyle who drafted the Biological Weapons Convention Act followed by many nations. The report has caused a major international controversy and is suppressed actively by a section of mainstream media.The Saudi SARS Sample. On June 13, 2012 a 60-year-old Saudi man was admitted to a private hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, with a 7-day history of fever, cough, expectoration, and shortness of breath. He had no history of cardiopulmonary or renal disease, was receiving no long-term medications, and did not smoke.Egyptian virologist Dr. Ali Mohamed Zaki isolated and identified a previously unknown coronavirus from his lungs. After routine diagnostics failed to identify the causative agent, Zaki contacted Ron Fouchier, a leading virologist at the Erasmus Medical Center (EMC) in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, for advice. Fouchier sequenced the virus from a sample sent by Zaki. Fouchier used a broad-spectrum “pan-coronavirus” real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method to test for distinguishing features of a number of known coronaviruses known to infect humans.This Coronavirus sample was acquired by Scientific Director Dr. Frank Plummer (key to Coronavirus investigation Frank Plummer was recently assassinated in Africa) of Canada’s National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) in Winnipeg directly from Fouchier, who received it from Zaki. This virus was reportedly stolen from the Canadian lab by Chinese agents.The Canadian Lab\n",
      "Coronavirus arrived at Canada’s NML Winnipeg facility on May 4, 2013 from the Dutch lab. The Canadian lab grew up stocks of the virus and used it to assess diagnostic tests being used in Canada. Winnipeg scientists worked to see which animal species can be infected with the new virus.Research was done in conjunction with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency’s national lab, the National Centre for Foreign Animal Diseases which is housed in the same complex as the National Microbiology Laboratory.NML has a long history of offering comprehensive testing services for coronaviruses. It isolated and provided the first genome sequence of the SARS coronavirus and identified another coronavirus NL63 in 2004.This Winnipeg based Canadian lab was targeted by Chinese agents in what could be termed as Biological Espionage.Chinese Biological Espionage. In March 2019, in mysterious event a shipment of exceptionally virulent viruses from Canada’s NML ended up in China. The event caused a major scandal with Bio-warfare experts questioning why Canada was sending lethal viruses to China. Scientists from NML said the highly lethal viruses were a potential bio-weapon.\n",
      "Following investigation, the incident was traced to Chinese agents working at NML. Four months later in July 2019, a group of Chinese virologists were forcibly dispatched from the Canadian National Microbiology Laboratory (NML). The NML is Canada’s only level-4 facility and one of only a few in North America equipped to handle the world’s deadliest diseases, including Ebola, SARS, Coronavirus, etc.Xiangguo Qiu – The Chinese Bio-Warfare Agent. The NML scientist who was escorted out of the Canadian lab along with her husband, another biologist, and members of her research team is believed to be a Chinese Bio-Warfare agent Xiangguo Qiu. Qiu was the head of the Vaccine Development and Antiviral Therapies Section in the Special Pathogens Program at Canada’s NML.Xiangguo Qiu is an outstanding Chinese scientist born in Tianjin. She primarily received her medical doctor degree from Hebei Medical University in China in 1985 and came to Canada for graduate studies in 1996. Later on, she was affiliated with the Institute of Cell Biology and the Department of Pediatrics and Child Health of the University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, not engaged with studying pathogens. But a shift took place, somehow. Since 2006, she has been studying powerful viruses in Canada’s NML. The viruses shipped from the NML to China were studied by her in 2014, for instance (together with the viruses Machupo, Junin, Rift Valley Fever, Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever and Hendra).Infiltrating the Canadian Lab. Dr. Xiangguo Qiu is married to another Chinese scientist – Dr. Keding Cheng, also affiliated with the NML, specifically the “Science and Technology Core”. Dr. Cheng is primarily a bacteriologist who shifted to virology. The couple is responsible for infiltrating Canada’s NML with many Chinese agents as students from a range of Chinese scientific facilities directly tied to China’s Biological Warfare Program, namely:Institute of Military Veterinary, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Changchun. Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Chengdu Military Region. Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hubei.Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing. All of the above four mentioned Chinese Biological Warfare facilities collaborated with Dr. Xiangguo Qiu within the context of Ebola virus, the Institute of Military Veterinary joined a study on the Rift Valley fever virus too, while the Institute of Microbiology joined a study on Marburg virus. Noticeably, the drug used in the latter study – Favipiravir – has been earlier tested successfully by the Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences, with the designation JK-05 (originally a Japanese patent registered in China already in 2006), against Ebola and additional viruses.However, the studies by Dr. Qiu are considerably more advanced and apparently vital for the Chinese biological weapons development in case Coronavirus, Ebola, Nipah, Marburg or Rift Valley fever viruses are included therein.The Canadian investigation is ongoing and questions remain whether previous shipments to China of other viruses or other essential preparations, took place from 2006 to 2018, one way or another.Dr. Xiangguo Qiu also collaborated in 2018 with three scientists from the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, Maryland, studying post-exposure immunotherapy for two Ebola viruses and Marburg virus in monkeys; a study supported by the US Defense Threat Reduction Agency.The Wuhan Coronavirus. Dr. Xiangguo Qiu made at least five trips over the school year 2017-18 to the above mentioned Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which was certified for BSL4 in January 2017. Moreover, in August 2017, the National Health Commission of China approved research activities involving Ebola, Nipah, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses at the Wuhan facility.Coincidentally, the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory is located only 20 miles away from the Huanan Seafood Market which is the epicenter of the Coronavirus outbreak dubbed the Wuhan Coronavirus.The Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory is housed at the Chinese military facility Wuhan Institute of Virology linked to China’s Biological Warfare Program. It was the first ever lab in the country designed to meet biosafety-level-4 (BSL-4) standards – the highest biohazard level, meaning that it would be qualified to handle the most dangerous pathogens. \n",
      "In January 2018, the lab was operational ‘for global experiments on BSL-4 pathogens,’ wrote Guizhen Wu in the journal Biosafety and Health. ‘After a laboratory leak incident of SARS in 2004, the former Ministry of Health of China initiated the construction of preservation laboratories for high-level pathogens such as SARS, coronavirus, and pandemic influenza virus,’ wrote Guizhen Wu.Coronavirus Bioweapon. The Wuhan institute has studied coronaviruses in the past, including the strain that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, H5N1 influenza virus, Japanese encephalitis, and dengue. Researchers at the institute also studied the germ that causes anthrax – a biological agent once developed in Russia.“Coronaviruses (particularly SARS) have been studied in the institute and are probably held therein,” said Dany Shoham, a former Israeli military intelligence officer who has studied Chinese biowarfare. He said. “SARS is included within the Chinese BW program, at large, and is dealt with in several pertinent facilities.”James Giordano, a neurology professor at Georgetown University and senior fellow in Biowarfare at the U.S. Special Operations Command, said China’s growing investment in bio-science, looser ethics around gene-editing and other cutting-edge technology and integration between government and academia raise the spectre of such pathogens being weaponized.That could mean an offensive agent, or a modified germ let loose by proxies, for which only China has the treatment or vaccine. “This is not warfare, per se,” he said. “But what it’s doing is leveraging the capability to act as global saviour, which then creates various levels of macro and micro economic and bio-power dependencies.”China’s Biological Warfare Program. In a 2015 academic paper, Shoham – of Bar-Ilan’s Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies – asserts that more than 40 Chinese facilities are involved in bio-weapon production.China’s Academy of Military Medical Sciences actually developed an Ebola drug – called JK-05 — but little has been divulged about it or the defence facility’s possession of the virus, prompting speculation its Ebola cells are part of China’s bio-warfare arsenal, Shoham told the National Post.Ebola is classified as a “category A” bioterrorism agent by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, meaning it could be easily transmitted from person to person, would result in high death rates and “might cause panic.” The CDC lists Nipah as a category C substance, a deadly emerging pathogen that could be engineered for mass dissemination.China’s Biological Warfare Program is believed to be in an advanced stage that includes research and development, production and weaponization capabilities. Its current inventory is believed to include the full range of traditional chemical and biological agents with a wide variety of delivery systems including artillery rockets, aerial bombs, sprayers, and short-range ballistic missiles.Weaponizing Biotech.China’s national strategy of military-civil fusion has highlighted biology as a priority, and the People’s Liberation Army could be at the forefront of expanding and exploiting this knowledge.The PLA is pursuing military applications for biology and looking into promising intersections with other disciplines, including brain science, supercomputing, and artificial intelligence. Since 2016, the Central Military Commission has funded projects on military brain science, advanced biomimetic systems, biological and biomimetic materials, human performance enhancement, and “new concept” biotechnology.In 2016, an AMMS doctoral researcher published a dissertation, “Research on the Evaluation of Human Performance Enhancement Technology,” which characterized CRISPR-Cas as one of three primary technologies that might boost troops’ combat effectiveness. The supporting research looked at the effectiveness of the drug Modafinil, which has applications in cognitive enhancement; and at transcranial magnetic stimulation, a type of brain stimulation, while also contending that the “great potential” of CRISPR-Cas. as a “military deterrence technology in which China should “grasp the initiative” in development.In 2016, the potential strategic value of genetic information led the Chinese government to launch the National Genebank, which intends to become the world’s largest repository of such data. It aims to “develop and utilize China’s valuable genetic resources, safeguard national security in bioinformatics, and enhance China’s capability to seize the strategic commanding heights” in the domain of Biotechnology Warfare.Chinese military’s interest in biology as an emerging domain of warfare is guided by strategists who talk about potential “genetic weapons” and the possibility of a “bloodless victory.”This story has been published in full in one of the world’s largest Chinese TV News Network – NTDTV.\n",

      "A few days ago, Dr. Tedros, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) repeated what he said already a few weeks ago, that there are about 20 pharmaceutical laboratories throughout the world that are developing a vaccine for the novel coronavirus, named COVID-19, also called 2019-nCOV, or SARS-CoV-2. For the layman, it is just a stronger mutation of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus, that broke out in 2002 / 2003, also in China. To be sure, a mutation made in a laboratory. In a US high-security biological warfare laboratory. In other words, both SARS and COVID-19 – among many other bio-war agents – were made in the US.And now, the chaotic western-style race of private corporations for a vaccine wanting to outdo one another, has begun.\n",
      "Who is first to develop a vaccine? – It’s a fierce competition to establish a patent, a monopoly – for a possibly multi trillion-dollar business. Its western neoliberal capitalism at its very worst – or best, depending on the angle from where one looks.There are no words to describe this chaotic fever for profit over human wellbeing. It has nothing to do with health, with healing sick and suffering, possibly dying people. It’s all about money. Hundreds of billions, if not trillion of profit for the pharmaceutical oligarch and their associated research laboratories and enterprises. And even more so, if the WHO-declared “pandemic” (sic) will prompt a forced vaccination campaign, enhanced by military and police surveillance.Let’s put COVID-19 in context. As of 23 March 2020 (18:33 GMT), and according to WHO statistics, reported worldwide cases are 372572; deaths 16313; recovered 101373 – a death rate of 4.37%. However, these figures must be considered with caution. In many countries, especially developing economies, accurate testing may be a problem. Test kits are often not available, or not reliable. So, may people who go to the doctor with some flu symptoms are possibly falsely diagnosed as COVID-19 victims, as it serves the publicity hype.Miscalculations and false reporting may even occur in the United States. Mr. Robert Redfield, CEO of the US Center for Disease Control (CDC), testified before Congress that CDC does no longer carry out regular tests, that these were carried out at State-level and only in extreme cases. See also this reference form the LA Times of California measures and directives.By comparison, the US CDC estimates that in the 2019 / 2020 flu season in the US alone, some 38 to 54 million people may catch the common flu, and 23000 to 59000 may die from it. The vast majority of these deaths will be elderly people above 70-years of age and many of them with pre-health conditions and /or pre-existing respiratory problems. This is pretty much the same disease and death pattern as with COVID-19. Expanding these common flu figures linearly on a worldwide scale would result in hundreds of thousands of flu deaths. In the particularly strong 2017-2018 US flu season, an estimated 60000 people died from the flu in the US alone. The reader may himself judge whether WHO was justified declaring COVID-19 a “pandemic” — or whether there may have been – just perhaps – another agenda behind it?The vaccine that might eventually be applied to COVID-19, may most likely no longer be valid for the next coronavirus outbreak – which, also according to Mr. Redfield, CDC, will most probably occur. A later virus may most certainly have mutated. It’s quite similar to the common flu virus. In fact, the annually reoccurring common flu virus contains a proportion of 10% to 15% (some times more) of coronaviruses.\n",
      "The effectiveness of the annual flu vaccines is on average less than 50%, not to mention all the potential harmful side effects, they carry along. COVID-19 is very similar to influenza. Will a corona virus vaccine be equally weak in protecting a potential patient from a future infection?Cooperation instead of competition, doesn’t occur in the west. It’s all profit-driven. With a number of different vaccines from different pharma giants coming on the market, who will tell the patient which one is the best, most suitable for the patient’s condition? It smells like an utter chaotic scam.The real question is – are vaccines – or a vaccine – even necessary? Maybe – maybe not. The production of vaccines is pushed for profit motives and for an important political agenda for a New World Order – that has been planned to change human life as we know it, or thought we knew it. See further explanations below.Vaccines don’t heal, they may prevent the virus from hitting as hard as it might otherwise do, or not at all, depending on the age, physical and health condition of a person. Worldwide statistics show that usually a person up to the age of 40 or 50, who is infected by the COVID-19, has none or only slight symptoms, nothing to worry about.Should symptoms show up, staying home, resting and using traditional, age-old medicine, the same that might be used for the common flu, might be enough to get rid of the virus. This might resolve the disease within one or two weeks. Then, the person will be naturally “vaccinated” against this strand of coronavirus. Elderly people above 65 or 70 may be more at risk and special attention may be in order – separated from crowds, isolation during a two-week quarantine (the incubation period), while the rest of society goes on with life as normal as possible, thereby reducing the huge cost to society.China has brought the COVID-19 pandemic under control without a vaccine, but using common sense and traditional, rather inexpensive medication. What are these regular medicines that are effective and have helped to bring COVID-19 under control in China, without a vaccine?The “Children’s Health Defense” (the Children’s Defense Fund – CDF), an American NGO, founded 1973 by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., depicts the current power struggle in France between health official and the country’s leading experts in virology, as representative for the worldwide fight between corporate pharma supported by (bought) governments and international organizations, such as WHO – and renowned scientists. If laid open, it is an eye-opener. See full CDF study.French Professor Didier Raoult, who is one of the world’s top 5 scientists on communicable diseases, argued that the approach of mass quarantine is both inefficient and outdated and that large-scale testing and treatment of suspected cases achieves far better results.Early on, Dr. Raoult suggested the use of hydroxychloroquine (Chloroquine or Plaquenil), a well-known, simple, and inexpensive drug, also used to fight Malaria, and that has shown efficacy with previous coronaviruses such as SARS. By mid-February 2020, clinical trials at his institute and in China already confirmed that the drug could reduce the viral load and bring spectacular improvement. The Chinese scientists published their first trials on more than 100 patients and announced that the Chinese National Health Commission would recommend Chloroquine in their new guidelines to treat Covid-19.In addition, China and Cuba are working together with the use of Interferon Alpha 2B, a highly efficient anti-viral drug developed in Cuba some 39 years, but little known to the world, because of the US imposed embargo on anything from Cuba. Interferon has also proven to be very effective in fighting COVID-19 and is now produced in a joint-venture in China.\n",
      "Chinese researchers in cooperation with Cuban scientists are also developing a vaccine which may soon be ready for testing. In contrast to the west, working exclusively on profit-motives, the Chinese-Cuban vaccine would be made available at low cost to the entire world.Other simple, but effective remedies include the use of heavy doses of Vitamin C, as well as Vitamin D3, or more generally the use of Micronutrients essential to fight infections, include vitamins A, B, C, D, and E.Another remedy that has been used for thousands of years by ancient Chinese, Romans and Egyptians, are Colloidal silver products. They come in forms to be administered as a liquid by mouth, or injected, or applied to the skin. Colloidal silver products are boosting the immune system, fighting bacteria and viruses, and have been used for treating cancer, HIV/AIDS, shingles, herpes, eye ailments, prostatitis – and COVID-19.\n",
      "Yet another simple and inexpensive remedy, to be used in combination with others, is menthol-based “Mentholatum”. It’s used for common flu and cold symptoms. Rubbed on and around the nose, it acts as a disinfectant and prevents germs to enter the respiratory track.Northern Italy and New Orleans report that an unusual number of patients had to be hospitalized in Intensive Care Units (ICU) and be put 24×7 on a 90% strength respirator, with some of them remaining unresponsive, going into respiratory failure. The reported death rate is about 40%. The condition is called acute respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS. That means the lungs are filled with fluid. When this description of ARDS episodes applies, Dr. Raoult and other medical colleagues recommend COVID-19 patients to “sleep sitting up” until they are cured. This helps drain the liquid out of the lungs. The method has been known to work successfully since it was first documented during the 1918 Spanish Flu epidemic.As you may expect, if you look up any of these alternative cures on internet – internet controlled by Google and the Big Corporatocracy, including the pharmaceuticals, will logically advise you against using them. At best they will tell you that these products or methods have not proven effective, and at worst, that they may be harmful. Don’t believe it. None of these products or methods are harmful. Remember, some of them have been used as natural remedies for thousands of years. And remember, China has successfully come to grips with COVID-19, using some of these relatively simple and inexpensive medications.Unfortunately, few doctors are aware of these practical, simple and inexpensive remedies. They are safe and more often than not successful. The media, under pressure from the pharma giants and the compliant government agencies, have been requested to censoring such valuable information. The negligence or failure, to make such easily accessible remedies public knowledge is killing people.Now, let’s cut to the chase, to what’s behind it all – behind the extraordinary monstrous media propaganda hype that is bringing down the entire (western) world’s socioeconomic system, creating untold misery, famine, and death. A misery with suffering potentially by orders of magnitude worse than the Big Depression of 1928 / 1929 and the subsequent years.If anybody had any doubts up to now, where the virus originated, the truth was dropped surreptitiously, a slip of the tongue or on purpose, by Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, when he addressed the Nation on 21 March on COVID-19, he said, “This is not about retribution, we are in a live exercise here…”, meaning military exercise, or a war game.President Trump by Pompeo’s side was whispering, “you should have let us know”. Whatever that means. It’s hard to believe that Mr. Trump didn’t know. But these are the vagaries of American politics, even on a death-serious subject like the new coronavirus breakout. See here with a brief video. See this also.This live (military) exercise has unimaginable worldwide implications which may completely transform our lives. It’s economic warfare. Almost every country on this planet is on some kind of a lock-down, a quarantine of sorts for an as of yet undetermined period, with businesses closed, shops and restaurants shot, construction sites halted, people working from home if they can, being in the streets is forbidden, in many countries under police and military surveillance, with cases of people being beaten up and hand-cuffed, if they have no good explanation.The President Macron-inspired French police is especially known for its uncontrolled brutality fighting the Yellow Vests. They have already demonstrated their same despise for their fellow citizens, when they are in the streets, even food shopping, without a special permit.Borders are shot, airlines are grounded, tourism comes to a screeching halt, basically from one day to the other, stranded throughout the world. With a few exceptions, Germany and France are rare ones, they organize return flights for their citizens abroad. Otherwise, with uncertain flight departures, over-booked and over-crowded flights, the stranded tourists have hardly a chance to return home soon.The socioeconomic cost is astronomical. In the multi-quadrillion, or quintillion; numbers with so many zeros they make you dizzy. This calamity can only partly be valued with numbers, and not now, as the world’s lock-down continues – with a social cost that cannot be valued. The dive of the stock market by about 30% – a typical bonanza for forward speculators and Big Finance, Big Banking, with multi-trillion-dollar losses for the small investors.Millions, if not hundreds of millions of small and medium size businesses going broke, unemployment going rampant, in the hundreds of millions, throughout the world, and the poorest of the poor, especially in developing countries, who are either unemployed or survive on small hourly or day-to-day jobs – they have no income, cannot buy the basics for survival – some of them may die from famine, others may commit suicide, others convert to crime. This is Greece by a factor of thousand, or worse.Then, there is a moral and societal breakdown from a forced quarantine, for which there is no clear end in sight. This creates fear and anxieties, frustration and anger.  For many it’s like solitary confinement – all of which is bad for health, and lowers the immune defense system. Just what those who pull the strings want.So, whom does this live (military) exercise serve? – First one would assume its destined to break China’s back, as China is the up-and-coming economic power. It is true, China’s economy has suffered enormously, with about 60% to 70% of all production stopped for the first two months this year, the time of the COVID-19 outbreak and peak, meaning a significant plunge of China’s GDP, maybe as much as 40% for January and February 2020.However, China has the corona virus now firmly under control. And China being China, her economy is recovering fast and may soon be back to what it was in December 2019. In fact, despite the significant impact of COVID-19, China’s economy may soon overtake that of the self-styled empire, the United States of America. China’s currency the yuan, is solidly backed by a strong economy and by gold, and is slated to become the world’s chief reserve currency, replacing the US-dollar, which had that role for the last 100 years. When that happens, the US hegemony is doomed.It goes without saying, our monetary system is planned to be fully electronic, no more cash – cash is poison – or as WHO’s Director General recently warned, not verbatim, but with that meaning, cash is dangerous for infections, paper money and coins may carry deadly viruses – thereby paving the way for full digitization of our monetary system. This has, indeed, already been tested over the past few years, mainly in Scandinavian countries, where entire department stores refuse to accept cash. In response to the WHO DG’s recommendation, some shops and restaurants in Germany refuse to accept cash.The universal vaccination and electronic ID go together and will first be tested in a few developing countries. Bangladesh is one of them. The vaccination program is the platform for the mega-changes the New World Order (NOW), or the One World Order (OWO) wants to bring about. This, in addition to the enormous money-making bonanza.An almost unknown agency called Agenda ID2020 is behind all this, monitoring, directing and adjusting the implementation of the various programs – that are supposed to eventually lead to Full Spectrum Dominance. For more details, see also the recent article on the dangers of Agenda ID2020.Behind this elaborate and complex network of things, appears time and again, one prominent name: Bill Gates, the Bill and Melinda Gate’s Foundation. Bill Gates has been funding vaccination programs in Africa for decades. And Bill Gates and the Rockefellers make no secret that one of their ultimate goal for planet earth is a drastic population reduction.Abstract of Agenda ID2020.Agenda ID2020 – is an alliance of public-private partners, including UN agencies and civil society. It’s an electronic ID program that uses generalized vaccination as a platform for digital identity. The program harnesses existing birth registration and vaccination operations to provide newborns with a portable and persistent biometrically-linked digital identity.GAVI, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, identifies itself on its website as a global health partnership of public and private sector organizations dedicated to “immunization for all”. GAVI is supported by WHO, and needless to say, its main partners and sponsors are the pharma-industry.The ID2020 Alliance at their 2019 Summit, entitled “Rising to the Good ID Challenge”, in September 2019 in New York, decided to roll out their program in 2020, a decision confirmed by the WEF in January 2020 in Davos. Their digital identity program will be tested with the government of Bangladesh. GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, and “partners from academia and humanitarian relief” (as they call it), are part of the pioneer party.Is it just a coincidence that ID2020 is being rolled out at the onset of what WHO calls a Pandemic? – Or is a pandemic needed to ‘roll out’ the multiple devastating programs of ID2020?How the Vaccination Research and Production is supposed to work.How will this elaborate and complex business of creating vaccines and implementing vaccine campaign work? As most official activities that basically are government responsibilities are privatized and outsourced, they become complex, chaotic at times and inefficient. In the case of the west, the US pretends to take the lead, but will also assign responsibilities to European pharma-labs.The National Institute of Health (NIH) has overall responsibility for national health research and program implementation. NIH’s Director is Anthony Fauci. The Institute was created in 1955. Under NIH, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), one of 27 institutes, reporting to NIH, is responsible for vaccination programs. NIAD’s mission is to conduct basic and applied research to better understand, treat and prevent infectious, immunologic and allergic diseases. NIAD has outsourced the vaccination program to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).CEPI was formed by the WEF (World Economic Forum) in Davos in January 2017. It was founded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) and the London-based Welcome Trust, created in 1936, but including now as members several European countries and the European Union (EU). The BMGF made a first infusion to CEPI of US$ 460 million. CEPI also receives funding from Norway and India and is also heavily supported by the pharma-industry.According to CEPI’s website, CEPI has appealed for US$ 2 billion to support the development of a vaccine for COVID-19 and to expand the number of vaccine candidates to increase the chances of success and to fund the clinical trials for these candidate vaccines. CEPI’s ambition is to have at least three vaccine candidates, which could be submitted to regulatory authorities for licensing for general use/use in outbreaks.“Governments around the world will need to invest billions of euros more in coronavirus vaccine development, to take forward some promising candidates that are emerging.  – It’s a very risky business – everything is being done in parallel, you’re not building on the expertise of others – but good progress is being made,” said Melanie Saville, director of vaccine research and development at CEPI.CEPI has already some preselected international pharma corporations to research and work on a COVID-19 vaccine. They include the biotech “Moderna” in Seattle, not far from the Microsoft Headquarters – also a Bill Gates creation; the biotech lab Inovio, the University of Queensland, Australia, and the Germans, BioNTech and CureVac.rom the outset it looks that Moderna, CureVac and BioNTech are best suited to produce fast a vaccine, because according to a Health and Science report, published on March 17, 2020, “all three of these firms specialize in messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics. These mRNA molecules are used to instruct the body to produce its own immune response to fight a range of different diseases. This type of vaccine can potentially be developed and produced more quickly than traditional vaccines.”Enters GAVI – the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization has also been created by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It is a global health partnership of public and private sector organizations, dedicated to “immunization for all”. GAVI is supported by WHO, and needless to say, its main partners and sponsors are the pharma-industry. GAVI has already announced it needs billions of dollars to support its COVID-19 vaccination program. In June 2020, the UK Government will sponsor a donor conference in support of GAVI’s COVID-19 vaccination program, expecting to raise US$ 7.3 billion.From this maze of overlapping organizations, activities and unclear responsibilities, the money-flow is likely going to be a crisscross that nobody can follow. Accountability on a large scale will be lost.As to the output – hopefully a vaccine – or several vaccines. For the layman and potential patient, it will be a matter of luck (or bad luck) what cocktail of biological substances will be injected into his or her body. In any case, the long-term outcome, is unpredictable. Remember, Bill Gates has been pursuing during the last fifteen or twenty years his own very special agenda. It is unlikely he will abandon it now. Rather COVID-19 and the ensuing vaccination program will allow him to enhance it.Concluding – it is amply clear that this is a huge money-making and public-rip-off proposition by the pharma industry. What makes this multi-billion-dollar scam even worse, is that it has an official rubber-stamp, by being supported by western governments and international organizations, foremost WHO, UNICEF and the World Bank.This may be the last opportunity for the elite, the 0.1%, to shuffle social capital and worker funded assets from the bottom to the top, before we enter an era of total control through electromagnetic fields (EMF), managed by the minions of the 0.1% and with 5G / 6G technology, where we, the remaining humans may have become mere tele-guided robots.It is by now a pipe dream to believe that the world may continue as it did until the end of the last decade. It would be too much of a coincidence that Agenda ID2020 started activating its evil programs exactly at the beginning of the decade 2020. Unfortunately, it is also a far-away dream that China and Cuba could lead the way for finding a cure for the most likely recurring coronavirus in one mutation or another – including but not exclusively, using traditional methods and remedies that have proven successful in the current battle to control COVID-19.There are draconian measures on the way, and we may just pray that they fail, or that we, the people, awake in time and in sufficient numbers – a critical mass – and find back to our innermost voice and soul – solidarity for each other that gives us strength to fight this Luciferian monster.\n",

      "Washington benefits from new SARS unsettling major competitors. Prior to the advent of the 2019-nCoV coronavirus, the so-called “first package” of the US-China trade agreement, which was signed on behalf of the Celestial Empire by Vice-Premier of the State Council of the PRC Liu He, was a tactical move that would allow China to take a break. And there is the presidential election in the United States, and it remains to be seen whether Donald Trump will be able to gain a foothold in the Oval Office for a second term ... But it looks like a malicious virus that has matured either in the stomachs of bats or in a snake’s gut has confused all the cards to a friend Xi Jinping.Against the background of alarming reports from the Chinese province of Hubei (when this material was being prepared, more than 4.5 thousand people fell ill with pneumonia, and 106 died, and these are not final numbers. - Auth.) Copper and iron ore prices collapsed.Copper cheaper ten days in a row, and yesterday the price fell by 1.5% - up to 5834.5 dollars per ton. Iron ore futures are falling in price, on Tuesday at the Singapore auction they offered 85 dollars per ton - a decrease of 6.4%. But, as Bloomberg predicts, $ 80 per tonne is not such a distant prospect. Prices for black gold also plummeted - April futures for the North Sea Brent oil mix were already trading below $ 58 per barrel.At the same time, the Fitch rating agency cautiously reports that the spread of coronavirus will first of all have a negative impact on the economies of Thailand, Vietnam and Singapore, since in these countries the most vulnerable regions to the epidemics are tourism and the service sector. The statement is indisputable - everyone will get it, and yet China, presumably, is more than others, since it is the Chinese economy that is the main consumer of both metals and energy resources, and tourism with services is not the last source of replenishment of the treasury. And since the prices of these goods went down, the Chinese economy also caught the “virus”. And it’s easier to negotiate with a “sick” client, which is well known even without Trump.It is noteworthy that 2019-nCoV got to the American technological giant Apple, whose production facilities are located just 500 kilometers from the “homeland” of the coronavirus - the Wuhan metropolis. And now, according to the Nikkei Asian Review, the production of popular iPhone smartphones is in jeopardy. Starbucks also found itself in a difficult situation, which, due to quarantine, had to close a large half of its four thousand coffee houses operating in China (by the way, this is the second largest market after the United States). But at the same time, the Americans for some reason do not look like such victims of the epidemic, especially Apple, whose leadership at the very beginning of the trade and economic confrontation with China advised to evacuate production facilities in the United States. It seems as if President Trump saw everything in advance, like Wolf Messing or old Wang. However, both Apple and Starbucks were really out of luck. You can’t say the same about the American political establishment, which is making titanic efforts to bring to its knees the \"presumptuous China.\" And why should these efforts necessarily be economic in nature? The main question is - who benefits from another SARS unsettling a competitor? If we apply the well-known trick highly likely, unceremoniously used by the British ex-prime minister Theresa May to hang the so-called Skripals poisoning in Russia, then the answer is obvious: the coronavirus epidemic 2019-nCoV, which hit China, is highly likely on the hand of the United States. And the worse for Beijing, the better for Washington. Moreover, the outlook for the epidemic is not yet encouraging. For example, some experts argue: if the spread of 2019-nCoV cannot be stopped, up to 250 million Chinese can become victims of the virus, which is almost two in number in Russia.By the way, about the prospects. The Cepi Global Vaccine Coalition has reportedly invested a total of $ 12.5 million in three projects, in which researchers are ready to expeditiously develop the 2019-nCoV vaccine.Scientists from the Australian University of Queensland, as well as two American biotechnology companies Inovio and Moderna, participate in the work. The American National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is also involved. And it seems that microbiologists from Hong Kong have already developed a vaccine against the new coronavirus, as Professor of Hong Kong University Ewan Kwok-Jung hastened to inform the newspaper South China Morning Post. But her research, he claims, could take more than a year. German Shipulin, the deputy director of the Center for Strategic Planning of the Russian Ministry of Health, does not promise an imminent victory over 2019-nCoV. So the hands of the coronavirus 2019-nCoV can be considered as yet untied, and there are suspicions that the United States may be involved in this epidemic. In the Russian media, this assumption has already been made.\n",
      "US operations as part of a biological warfare against the entire planet.As a result of the dengue epidemic in Cuba from 1978-1981, up to 500 thousand people were affected. Fidel Castro said this was the result of an American biological attack. Washington did not confirm or refute the allegations of the Cuban leader.Pentagon bio laboratories exist in 25 countries around the world. They are funded by the Military Threat Reduction Agency under a $ 2.1 billion military program. The joint biological interaction program includes laboratories located in the countries of the former Soviet Union, such as Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, as well as in the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Africa. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.By the location of these biological laboratories, we can confidently indicate the four countries and territories against which the American biological threats are now directed, these are Russia, Iran, China and the countries of Central and West Africa. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.The American company CH2M Hill, under contracts for the Pentagon bio-laboratories in Georgia, Uganda, Tanzania, Iraq, Afghanistan, Southeast Asia, was funded in the amount of $ 341.5 million. Of this amount, almost half ($ 161.1 million) was allocated for research in Lugar Center in Tbilisi. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.Its subcontractor, the private company Battelle, has worked in Pentagon bio labs in Afghanistan, Armenia, Georgia, Uganda, Tanzania, Iraq, Afghanistan and Vietnam. Battelle conducts research, development, testing and evaluation of the use of both highly toxic chemicals and highly pathogenic biological agents for a wide range of US government agencies. The company entered into federal contracts totaling $ 2 billion and ranks 23rd in the list of 100 best US state contractors. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.The Pentagon has a very long history of using insects as carriers of disease. According to a partially declassified US Army report of 1981, American scientists conducted a series of experiments on insects. These operations were part of the US Entomological War as part of a biological weapons program. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.The report reported two scenarios: 16 simultaneous attacks on the city by A. Aegypti mosquitoes infected with yellow fever, as well as Tularemia aerosol attack, and assessed their effectiveness in cash and loss of life. The results were very cynical. Pentagon experts were able to \"kill\" 625 thousand people at a cost of $ 0.29 per unit. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.Operation Big Itch: Field trials were carried out to determine the coverage and survivability of tropical rat fleas Xenopsylla cheopis for use as a disease carrier in biological warfare. In Ashington neither confirmed nor refuted this information.Operation Big Buzz: 1 million A. Aegypti mosquitoes were raised. One third of them were placed in ammunition, dropped from aircraft and scattered on the ground. Mosquitoes survived in the air and actively sought human blood. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.Operations on military experiments with tropical mosquitoes and ticks in Georgia. These types of mosquitoes and fleas (which were studied in the past as part of the US Entomological War Program) were imported into Georgia and tested at the Lugar Center. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.Anthrax is one of the biological agents in service with the US Army, not only in the past. Despite Pentagon claims that this program is only defensive, there are facts to the contrary. In 2016, at the Lugar Center, American scientists conducted the study “Genome Sequence of the Soviet / Russian Bacillus anthracis Vaccine Strain 55-VNIIVViM” (the sequence of the Soviet / Russian anthracite cancer vaccine in Russia), which was funded by the US Agency for Biological Weapons Sharing Program Threat Reduction (DTRA) in Tbilisi, and implemented by Metabiota. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is caused by the tick-borne virus Nairovirus (Nairovirus). The disease was first described in Crimea in 1944 and was called Crimean hemorrhagic fever. Later, it caused an epidemic in the Congo in 1969. In 2014, 34 people were infected with the CCHF, including a 4-year-old child, three of whom died. Pentagon biologists are currently studying the virus in Georgia as part of the DTRA project, Epidemiology of febrile illnesses caused by Dengue viruses and other Arboviruses in Georgia. The project included trials on patients with fever symptoms and collection of ticks as possible distributors of CCHV for laboratory analysis. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.Similar CCHV outbreaks occurred in Afghanistan, where there are 3 Pentagon bio labs. As of December 2017, 237 cases of CCHV were reported in this country, 41 of which were fatal. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.Bats are also being investigated as a carrier of various diseases at the Lugar Center, which scientists say are carriers of the Ebola virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and other deadly diseases. As of June 2017, 1980 cases were recorded with 699 deaths in 19 countries worldwide caused by MERS-CoV. This virus is designed and manufactured in the USA. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.Another weapon of bioterrorism is, according to a 1981 US Army report, Tularemia developed in the USA, or Rabbit Fever. New tularemia carriers, such as ticks and rodents, are currently being developed. DTRA has launched a number of projects on Tularemia and in Georgia at the Lugar Center. Highly pathogenic agents (EDP) can be used for military purposes. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.\n",
      "Ukraine itself does not have control over military biological laboratories on its territory. Under the 2005 Agreement between the US Department of Defense and the Department of Health of Ukraine, the Ukrainian government is prohibited from publicly disclosing confidential information about the US program. Ukraine is also required to transfer all dangerous pathogens to the US Department of Defense for biological research. Under this Agreement, the Pentagon was granted access to many state secrets of Ukraine. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.The Pentagon has invested at least $ 65 million in gene editing research. The U.S. Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has provided seven research teams to develop tools for altering the genome of insects, rodents, and bacteria through the DARPA Safe Gene program using new CRISPR-Cas9 technology. Washington did not confirm or refute this data.The worst biological weapon that may have already been used and possibly used in Russia is, again, perhaps used against the “enemy” of the USA - China. Until recently, ethnic biological weapons (biogenetic weapons) were theoretical weapons, the purpose of which is, first of all, to harm people of certain ethnic groups or genotypes (Russians, Chinese, etc.). Although officially the research and development of ethnic bio-weapons has never been publicly confirmed, documents show that the United States collects biological materials from certain ethnic groups - Russians and Chinese. American National Socialism in its purest form.US Air Force specifically collects samples of Russian DNA and synovial tissue, which causes concern in Moscow about a hidden American program for the use of biological weapons.Senator Franz Klintsevich commented on the words of President Vladimir Putin about the purposeful collection of Russian biomaterial: “In the West, everything is done very scrupulously and verified to the smallest detail: if we use biological weapons, then surely ... The relevant services in the West should know that we are aware of their interest. Let those who are engaged in this work on the territory of the Russian Federation not be offended. ”And it cannot be said that such suspicions have no reason. As you know, the United States ratified the Geneva Protocol and the Biological Weapons Convention back in 1975. But the biological games overseas have not stopped, and not only in the national territory. Already after the collapse of the USSR, American biological laboratories appeared, which is precisely established in Georgia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan. Where else - except that the State Department knows that it is, they say, absolutely peaceful organizations involved in the development of medicines. But if they are so peaceful, then why, one wonders, did the Americans build them not at home, but at the other end of the world?And the participants of the “visiting” American biological project are very specialized. For example, the US Army Institute of Infectious Disease Medical Research (USAMRIID, Fort Detrick), the Military Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), which is a division of the Pentagon, the Central Asian and Caucasian Biosafety Association, which monitors the biological potential of the CIS countries, the Biological Threat Reduction Program (Nunn-Lugar program) and so on.Comments, as they say, are unnecessary. Not so long ago, the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation analyzed documents on the activities of the so-called \"health center\" that the Americans built in Georgia, and came to the conclusion: in fact, this is a \"death factory\", which killed 73 people who were used by overseas biologists as experimental rabbits. But the fact of the matter is that American bio-laboratories are scattered not only around Russia, but also around the world, where America has its own interests.And another question, where did the 2019-nCoV coronavirus originate - in a bat or in some American \"health center\"? Where is it more highly likely?Coronavirus: US biological warfare against Russia and China\n",

      "Last year a mysterious shipment was caught smuggling Coronavirus from Canada. It was traced to Chinese agents working at a Canadian lab. Subsequent investigation by GreatGameIndia linked the agents to Chinese Biological Warfare Program from where the virus is suspected to have leaked causing the Wuhan Coronavirus outbreak.On June 13, 2012 a 60-year-old Saudi man was admitted to a private hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, with a 7-day history of fever, cough, expectoration, and shortness of breath. He had no history of cardiopulmonary or renal disease, was receiving no long-term medications, and did not smoke.Egyptian virologist Dr. Ali Mohamed Zaki isolated and identified a previously unknown coronavirus from his lungs. After routine diagnostics failed to identify the causative agent, Zaki contacted Ron Fouchier, a leading virologist at the Erasmus Medical Center (EMC) in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, for advice.Fouchier sequenced the virus from a sample sent by Zaki. Fouchier used a broad-spectrum “pan-coronavirus” real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method to test for distinguishing features of a number of known coronaviruses known to infect humans.This Coronavirus sample was acquired by Scientific Director Dr. Frank Plummer of Canada’s National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) in Winnipeg directly from Fouchier, who received it from Zaki. This virus was reportedly stolen from the Canadian lab by Chinese agents.The Canadian Lab. Coronavirus arrived at Canada’s NML Winnipeg facility on May 4, 2013 from the Dutch lab. The Canadian lab grew up stocks of the virus and used it to assess diagnostic tests being used in Canada. Winnipeg scientists worked to see which animal species can be infected with the new virus.Research was done in conjunction with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency’s national lab, the National Centre for Foreign Animal Diseases which is housed in the same complex as the National Microbiology Laboratory.NML has a long history of offering comprehensive testing services for coronaviruses. It isolated and provided the first genome sequence of the SARS coronavirus and identified another coronavirus NL63 in 2004.This Winnipeg based Canadian lab was targeted by Chinese agents in what could be termed as Biological Espionage.Chinese Biological Espionage. In March 2019, in mysterious event a shipment of exceptionally virulent viruses from Canada’s NML ended up in China. The event caused a major scandal with Bio-warfare experts questioning why Canada was sending lethal viruses to China. Scientists from NML said the highly lethal viruses were a potential bio-weapon.Following investigation, the incident was traced to Chinese agents working at NML. Four months later in July 2019, a group of Chinese virologists were forcibly dispatched from the Canadian National Microbiology Laboratory (NML). The NML is Canada’s only level-4 facility and one of only a few in North America equipped to handle the world’s deadliest diseases, including Ebola, SARS, Coronavirus, etc.The NML scientist who was escorted out of the Canadian lab along with her husband, another biologist, and members of her research team is believed to be a Chinese Bio-Warfare agent Xiangguo Qiu. Qiu was the head of the Vaccine Development and Antiviral Therapies Section in the Special Pathogens Program at Canada’s NML.Xiangguo Qiu is an outstanding Chinese scientist born in Tianjin. She primarily received her medical doctor degree from Hebei Medical University in China in 1985 and came to Canada for graduate studies in 1996. Later on, she was affiliated with the Institute of Cell Biology and the Department of Pediatrics and Child Health of the University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, not engaged with studying pathogens.But a shift took place, somehow. Since 2006, she has been studying powerful viruses in Canada’s NML. The viruses shipped from the NML to China were studied by her in 2014, for instance (together with the viruses Machupo, Junin, Rift Valley Fever, Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever and Hendra).Infiltrating the Canadian Lab.Dr. Xiangguo Qiu is married to another Chinese scientist – Dr. Keding Cheng, also affiliated with the NML, specifically the “Science and Technology Core”. Dr. Cheng is primarily a bacteriologist who shifted to virology. The couple is responsible for infiltrating Canada’s NML with many Chinese agents as students from a range of Chinese scientific facilities directly tied to China’s Biological Warfare Program, namely:Institute of Military Veterinary, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Changchun. Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Chengdu Military Region. Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hubei. Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing. All of the above four mentioned Chinese Biological Warfare facilities collaborated with Dr. Xiangguo Qiu within the context of Ebola virus, the Institute of Military Veterinary joined a study on the Rift Valley fever virus too, while the Institute of Microbiology joined a study on Marburg virus. Noticeably, the drug used in the latter study – Favipiravir – has been earlier tested successfully by the Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences, with the designation JK-05 (originally a Japanese patent registered in China already in 2006), against Ebola and additional viruses.However, the studies by Dr. Qiu are considerably more advanced and apparently vital for the Chinese biological weapons development in case Coronavirus, Ebola, Nipah, Marburg or Rift Valley fever viruses are included therein.The Canadian investigation is ongoing and questions remain whether previous shipments to China of other viruses or other essential preparations, took place from 2006 to 2018, one way or another.Dr. Xiangguo Qiu also collaborated in 2018 with three scientists from the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, Maryland, studying post-exposure immunotherapy for two Ebola viruses and Marburg virus in monkeys; a study supported by the US Defense Threat Reduction Agency.The Wuhan Coronavirus.Dr. Xiangguo Qiu made at least five trips over the school year 2017-18 to the above mentioned Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which was certified for BSL4 in January 2017. Moreover, in August 2017, the National Health Commission of China approved research activities involving Ebola, Nipah, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses at the Wuhan facility.Coincidentally, the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory is located only 20 miles away from the Huanan Seafood Market which is the epicenter of the Coronavirus outbreak dubbed the Wuhan Coronavirus.The Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory is housed at the Chinese military facility Wuhan Institute of Virology linked to China’s Biological Warfare Program. It was the first ever lab in the country designed to meet biosafety-level-4 (BSL-4) standards – the highest biohazard level, meaning that it would be qualified to handle the most dangerous pathogens. In January 2018, the lab was operational ‘for global experiments on BSL-4 pathogens,’ wrote Guizhen Wu in the journal Biosafety and Health. ‘After a laboratory leak incident of SARS in 2004, the former Ministry of Health of China initiated the construction of preservation laboratories for high-level pathogens such as SARS, coronavirus, and pandemic influenza virus,’ wrote Guizhen Wu.Coronavirus Bioweapon.The Wuhan institute has studied coronaviruses in the past, including the strain that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, H5N1 influenza virus, Japanese encephalitis, and dengue. Researchers at the institute also studied the germ that causes anthrax – a biological agent once developed in Russia.“Coronaviruses (particularly SARS) have been studied in the institute and are probably held therein,” said Dany Shoham, a former Israeli military intelligence officer who has studied Chinese biowarfare. He said. “SARS is included within the Chinese BW program, at large, and is dealt with in several pertinent facilities.”James Giordano, a neurology professor at Georgetown University and senior fellow in Biowarfare at the U.S. Special Operations Command, said China’s growing investment in bio-science, looser ethics around gene-editing and other cutting-edge technology and integration between government and academia raise the spectre of such pathogens being weaponized. That could mean an offensive agent, or a modified germ let loose by proxies, for which only China has the treatment or vaccine. “This is not warfare, per se,” he said. “But what it’s doing is leveraging the capability to act as global saviour, which then creates various levels of macro and micro economic and bio-power dependencies.”China’s Biological Warfare Program.In a 2015 academic paper, Shoham – of Bar-Ilan’s Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies – asserts that more than 40 Chinese facilities are involved in bio-weapon production.China’s Academy of Military Medical Sciences actually developed an Ebola drug – called JK-05 — but little has been divulged about it or the defence facility’s possession of the virus, prompting speculation its Ebola cells are part of China’s bio-warfare arsenal, Shoham told the National Post.Ebola is classified as a “category A” bioterrorism agent by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, meaning it could be easily transmitted from person to person, would result in high death rates and “might cause panic.” The CDC lists Nipah as a category C substance, a deadly emerging pathogen that could be engineered for mass dissemination.China’s Biological Warfare Program is believed to be in an advanced stage that includes research and development, production and weaponization capabilities. Its current inventory is believed to include the full range of traditional chemical and biological agents with a wide variety of delivery systems including artillery rockets, aerial bombs, sprayers, and short-range ballistic missiles.Weaponizing Biotech. China’s national strategy of military-civil fusion has highlighted biology as a priority, and the People’s Liberation Army could be at the forefront of expanding and exploiting this knowledge. The PLA is pursuing military applications for biology and looking into promising intersections with other disciplines, including brain science, supercomputing, and artificial intelligence. Since 2016, the Central Military Commission has funded projects on military brain science, advanced biomimetic systems, biological and biomimetic materials, human performance enhancement, and “new concept” biotechnology.In 2016, an AMMS doctoral researcher published a dissertation, “Research on the Evaluation of Human Performance Enhancement Technology,” which characterized CRISPR-Cas as one of three primary technologies that might boost troops’ combat effectiveness. The supporting research looked at the effectiveness of the drug Modafinil, which has applications in cognitive enhancement; and at transcranial magnetic stimulation, a type of brain stimulation, while also contending that the “great potential” of CRISPR-Cas as a “military deterrence technology in which China should “grasp the initiative” in development.In 2016, the potential strategic value of genetic information led the Chinese government to launch the National Genebank, which intends to become the world’s largest repository of such data. It aims to “develop and utilize China’s valuable genetic resources, safeguard national security in bioinformatics, and enhance China’s capability to seize the strategic commanding heights” in the domain of Biotechnology Warfare.Chinese military’s interest in biology as an emerging domain of warfare is guided by strategists who talk about potential “genetic weapons” and the possibility of a “bloodless victory.”\n",

      "THE STORY:The China Coronavirus COVID-19 rose to public attention late December 2019, but certain events October 2019 either planned for or precipitated it – such as the rollout of 5G in Wuhan.THE IMPLICATIONS:What is the coronavirus-5G connection? Is this bioweapon an excuse for mandatory vaccination, including DNA vaccines, which can be injected using a technique very similar to the EMF pulsed waves of 5G? The China Coronavirus 5G Connection is a very important factor when trying to comprehend the coronavirus (formerly abbreviated 2019-nCoV, now COVID-19) outbreak. Various independent researchers around the web, for around 2-3 weeks now, have highlighted the coronavirus-5G link despite the fact that Google (as the self-appointed NWO Censor-in-Chief) is doing its best to hide and scrub all search results showing the connection. The coronavirus 5G connection doesn’t mean the bioweapons connection is false (it’s not a case of either-or), but rather broadens the scope of the entire event. Wuhan was one of the test cities chosen for China 5G rollout; 5G went live there on October 31st, 2019, almost exactly 2 months before the coronavirus outbreak began. Meanwhile, many scientific documents on the health effects of 5G have verified that it causes flu-like symptoms. This article reveals the various connections behind the coronavirus phenomenon, including how 5G can exacerbate or cause the kind of illness you are attributing to the new virus. The rabbit hole is deep so let’s take a dive.5G – A Type of Directed Energy Weapon.For the deeper background to 5G, read my 2017 article 5G and IoT: Total Technological Control Grid Being Rolled Out Fast. Many people around the world, including concerned citizens, scientists and even governmental officials, are becoming aware of the danger of 5G. This is why it has already been banned in many places worldwide, such as Brussels, the Netherlands and parts of Switzerland, Ireland, Italy, Germany, the UK, the USA and Australia. After all, 5G is not just the next generation of mobile connectivity after 4G; it is a radical and entirely new type of technology – a military technology used on the battlefield that is now being ‘deployed’ (military term) in the civilian realm. It is phased array weaponry being sold and disguised as primarily a communications system when the frequency bands it uses (24GHz – 100+GHz including MMW [millimeter waves]) are the very same ones used in Active Denial Systems, i.e. crowd control. Even mainstream Wikipedia describes Active Denial Systems as directed energy weaponry; it disperses crowds by firing energy at them, causing immediate and intense pain, including a sensation of the skin burning. Remember, directed energy weapons (DEW) are behind the fall of the Twin Towers on 9/11 and the fake Californian ‘wildfires’.Numerous scientists have warned of the dangerous health effects of 5G. For instance, in this 5G Appeal from 2017 entitled Scientists and Doctors Warn of Potential Serious Health Effects of 5G, scientists warned of the harmful of non-ionizing RF/EMF radiation:If you listen to Mark Steele and Barrie Trower, you’ll get an idea of the horrifying effects of 5G. In this interview, Trower echoes the above quote by stating how 5G damages the immune system of trees and kills insects. He reveals how in 1977, 5G was tested on animals in hopes of finding a weapon. The results were severe demyelination – stripping the protective sheath of nerve cells. Some nations are now noticing a 90% loss of insects (including pollinating insects like bees) which congregate around lamp-posts where 5G is installed. \n",
      "Wuhan Military Games and Event 201 Simulation.If you dig deep enough, some disturbing connections arise between 5G and the men who have developed or are developing vaccines for novel viruses like ebola, zika and the new coronavirus COVID-19. In a fantastic piece of research, an author under the pen name of Annie Logical wrote the article Corona Virus Fakery And The Link To 5G Testing that lays out the coronavirus 5G connection. There is a ton of information, so I will break it all down to make it more understandable.From October 18-27th 2019, Wuhan hosted the Military World Games and specifically used 5G (for the first time ever) for the event. Also on October 18th, 2019 in New York, the Johns Hopkins Center in partnership with World Economic Forum (WEF) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation hosted Event 201 – “A Global Pandemic Exercise” which is a simulation of a pandemic. Guess what virus they happen to choose for their ‘simulation’? A coronavirus! Guess what animal cells they use? Pig cells! (COVID-19 was initially reported to be derived from a seafood market, and the fish there are known to be fed on pig waste). Event 201 includes the UN (since the WEF now has a partnership agreement with UN), Big Pharma (Johnson and Johnson), Bill Gates (key figure in pushing vaccines, human microchipping and Agenda 2030) and both China and America’s CDC. Participants in Event 201 recommended that governments force social media companies to stop the spread of ‘fake news’ and that ultimately the only way to control the information would be for the WHO (World Health Organization, part of the UN) to be the sole central purveyor of information during a pandemic.Inovio, Electroporation and 5G.As reported on January 24th, 2020, US biotech and pharmaceutical company Inovio received a $9 million grant to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus. Inovio got the money grant from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), however they already have an existing partnership with CEPI; in April 2018 they got up to $56 million to develop vaccines for Lassa Fever and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). CEPI was founded in Davos by the governments of Norway and India, the Wellcome Trust … and the participants of Event 201: the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the WEF. CEPI’s CEO is the former director of BARDA (US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority) which is part of the HHS. Inovio claimed they developed a coronavirus vaccine in 2 hours! On the face of it such a claim is absurd; what is more likely is that they are lying or that they already had the vaccine because they had the foreknowledge that the coronavirus was coming and was about to be unleashed.So who owns and runs Inovio? Two key men are David Weiner and Dr. Joseph Kim. Weiner was once Kim’s university professor. Weiner was involved with developing a vaccine for HIV and zika (you can read my articles about zika here and here where I exposed some of the lies surrounding that epidemic). Kim was funded by Merck (a large Big Pharma company) and produced something called Porcine Circovirus (PCV 1 and PCV 2). As mentioned above, there is a link between pig vaccines/pig DNA and the coronavirus; Annie Logical notes that it “has long been established that seafood in the area is fed on pig waste.” Kim served a 5-year tenure as a member of the WEF’s Global Agenda Council – yet another organ pushing the New World Order One World Government under the banner of Agenda 2030 Global Governance.Weiner is an employee and advisor to the FDA, is considered a DNA technology expert and pioneered a new DNA transference method called electroporation – a microbiology technique which uses an electrical pulse to create temporary pores in cell membranes through which substances like chemicals, drugs or DNA can be introduced into the cell. This technique can be used to administer DNA vaccines, which inject foreign DNA into a host’s cells that changes the host’s DNA. This means if you take a DNA vaccine, you are allowing your DNA to be changed! As if vaccines weren’t already horrific enough … but here’s the kicker: electroporation uses pulsed waves. Guess what else uses pulsed waves? 5G! This is either a startling coincidence or evidence or a sinister coronavirus 5G-connection. [T]he same action that 5G technology uses in pulsed waves and the coronavirus was reported to have started in an area in China that had rolled out 5G technology! So we can see how geneticists using scientists are tampering with the building blocks of our existence and what is disturbing is that Prof Wiener is a HIV pioneer and we know that soon after the Polio vaccines were given to millions in Africa that HIV emerged. They have perfected the art of injecting animal or bird DNA into human chromosomes which alters our DNA and causes things like haemorrhaging, fever, cancers and even death.”Speaking of HIV (which is not the same things as AIDS, but that is another story), remember also that a group of Indian scientists put out their research that the virus was manmade and had HIV inserts. They found that 4 separate HIV genes were randomly embedded within the coronavirus. These genes somehow converged to create receptor sites on the virus that were identical to HIV, which was a surprise due to their random placement. They also specifically stated that this was not likely to happen naturally (“unlikely to be fortuitous in nature”). In yet another example of egregious censorship, these scientists were pressured to withdraw their work.5G and Electroporation DNA Vaccines – Both Producing Pulsed EMF Waves. Consider the implications of this for a moment. The technology exists to use EMFs to open your very skin pores and inject foreign DNA into your bloodstream and cells. This is an extreme violation of your bodily sovereignty, and it can have long-term effects, because of genetic mutation – changing your very DNA which is the biological blueprint and physical essence of who you are.What if 5G mimics electroporation? What if 5G can do on a large scale what electroporation does on a small scale? We already know that 5G has the potential to be mutagenic (DNA-damaging). The frequencies that 5G uses, especially 75-100GHz, interact with the geometrical structure of our skin and sweat ducts, acting upon them like a transmission reaching an antenna, and fundamentally affecting us and our mood.What if 5G is being used to open up the skin of those in Wuhan so as to allow the new bioweapon coronavirus to infiltrate more easily?Mandatory Vaccines, Depopulation and Transhumanism.So, what’s at the bottom of the coronavirus-5G connection rabbit hole? I would suggest we find mandatory vaccine agenda, the depopulation agenda and transhumanist agenda (via DNA vaccines). The key figures and groups who appear to have planned this already have the vaccine in place, just as they did for the other epidemics that fizzled out (SARS, ebola and zika). Weiner even has links to HIV/AIDS, and if you dive into that as Jon Rappoport did, you find gaping holes in that story.It’s the same epidemic/pandemic game played out every 2-3 years. There’s a couple of versions. In the first version, you invent a virus, hype it up, get people scared, do ineffectual and inconclusive tests (e.g. like the PCR test which measures if a viral fragment is present but doesn’t tell you the quantities of whether it would actually causing the disease), inflate the body count, justify quarantine/martial law and brainwash people into thinking they have to buy the (toxic) vaccine and introduce mandatory vaccination. You don’t even need a real virus or pathogen for the version. In the second version, you create a virus as a bioweapon, release it as a test, pretend it was a natural mutation, watch how many people it kills (which helps with the eugenics and depopulation agendas), again justify martial law, again justify the need for mandatory vaccines and even pose as the savior with the vaccine that stops it. As a variation on this second version, you can even develop a race-specific bioweapon so as to reduce the population of rival nations or enemy races as a geopolitical strategy. This article suggests that the coronavirus targets Chinese people/Asians more than others, and certainly the official death count attests to that, although it’s always hard to trust governmental statistics. Annie Logical gives her take:The con job goes like this.poison the population purposely to create disease that does not and would never occur naturally. parlay the purposely created disease as being caused by something invisible, outside the realm of control or knowledge of the average person, create a toxic vaccine or medication that was always intended to further poison the population into an early grave. parlay the vaccine or medication poisoning as PROOF the disease, which never existed, is much worse than anticipated. increase the initial poisoning, which is marketed as a fake disease, and also increase the vaccine and medication poisoning, to start piling the bodies into the stratosphere. repeat as many times as possible upon an uninformed population because killing a population this way (the art of having people line up to kill themselves with poison……known as a “soft kill” method) is the only legal way to make sure such eugenic operations can be executed on mass and in plain sight.“DNA vaccines are a disturbing new advancement for transhumanism. After all, the objective of the transhumanist agenda is to merge man with machine, and in doing so, wipe out what fundamentally makes us human, so we can be controlled and overtaken by a deeply sinister and negative force. It’s all about changing us at the fundamental level, or attacking human sovereignty itself. DNA vaccines fit right in with that – literally changing your DNA by forcefully inserting foreign DNA to change your genetics, with consequences no one could possibly fully foresee and predict.One Last Coronavirus-5G Connection. Finally, I will finish with another coronavirus-5G connection. The word coronavirus itself refers to many kinds of viruses by that name, not just COVID-19. Guess who owns a patent for a coronavirus strain (not SARS CoV2 or COVID-19) that can be used to develop a vaccine? The Pirbright Institute.  And guess who partially owns them? Bill Gates! As you can read here Pirbright is being supported in their vaccine developement endeavors by a British company Innovate UK … who also funds and supports the rollout of 5G. Innovate UK ran a competition in 2018 with a £15 million share out to any small business that could produce vaccines for ‘epidemic’ potential.The Motivation to Hype and the Motivation to Downplay. History has shown that in cases of epidemics (or fake epidemics) there is almost always a morass of conflicting reports and contradictory information. In such situations, it can be very difficult to get to the bottom of the matter and find the truth. The conflict stems from the different motivations of nations, governments and other interested groups. Essentially, there are 2 main motivations: the motivation to hype (exaggerate and use fear to grab attention, sell something, make a group look bad/incompetent, make people scared, make the public accept mandatory vaccination and martial law) and the motivation to downplay (cover up and hide the true extent of the damage, morbidity or mortality so as to appear competent and in control, to lessen possible anger, backlash or disorder). Sometimes, these 2 motivations may drive the behavior of the same group, e.g. in the case of the Chinese Government, it has the motivation to hype (to get people afraid so they easily follow its draconian quarantine rules) and the motivation to downplay (so as to appear in the eyes of its people and the rest of the entire world to have the situation under control, to ensure saving face, credibility and a good reputation).\n",
      "Final Thoughts on the Coronavirus 5G Connection. Governments around the world have experimented with bioweapons both on their own citizens and foreign citizens, and even sold that research to other governments for their own benefit (e.g. Japan’s notorious Unit 731 which developed bioweapons in China, only to hand over that research to the US after losing World War 2). See Bioweapons: Lyme Disease, Weaponized Ticks, Plum Island & More for a brief history of the USG’s usage of weaponized ticks which resulted in Lyme Disease. The evidence that COVID-19 is a bioweapon is overwhelming – and so is the evidence that 5G is involved to either cause the flu-like symptoms/pneumonia people have been experiencing, and/or to exacerbate the virulence of the virus by weakening people’s immune systems and subjecting them to pulsed waves of EMF to open up their skin to foreign DNA fragments (including viruses).\n",

      "STORY AT-A-GLANCE\n",
      "Francis Boyle, who for decades has advocated against the development and use of bioweapons, suspects COVID-19 is a weaponized pathogen that escaped from Wuhan City’s Biosafety Level 4 facility, which was specifically set up to research coronaviruses and SARS\n",
      "According to Boyle, the COVID-19 virus is a chimera. It includes SARS, an already weaponized coronavirus, along with HIV genetic material and possibly flu virus. It also has gain of function properties that allow it to spread a greater distance than normal\n",
      "The incubation period for COVID-19 infection is still unknown, but estimates range from 14 days to 30 days\n",
      "The U.S. government spent $100 billion on biological warfare programs since September 11, 2001, up until October 2015\n",
      "While there have so far only been a limited number of reported cases of COVID-19 infection in the U.S., the U.S. military has designated several detention sites around the country to quarantine Americans, should the situation take a turn for the worse. As you know, a novel coronavirus (initially labeled 2019-nCOV before being renamed COVID-19 by the World Health Organization1) originating in Wuhan City, Hubei Province in China, is rapidly spreading across the world.\n",
      "The first case was reported in Wuhan on December 21, 2019. Symptoms include fever, shortness of breath, severe cough and pneumonia which, in more severe cases, can lead to impaired kidney and liver function and kidney failure.On January 21, 2020, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the first U.S. case4 — a patient in Washington state who had recently visited Wuhan. Then, the first U.S. death was reported February 29, 2020, in Washington state.\n",
      "Less than a week later, CBS News reported March 5, 2020, that the number of deaths had quickly risen to 11 nationwide in the U.S. — 10 in Washington state and one in California.6 Not only that, but as of that day, “The World Health Organization urged governments around the world to pull out ‘all the stops’” to fight the outbreak. On the up side, China “appeared to be over the worst” of it, CBS said.All told, as of March 5, 2020, there were 98067 reported cases of novel coronavirus infections affecting 88 countries, 80430 of which were in China. Worldometer.info provides an easy overview of confirmed cases and deaths that you can check for the latest statistics.COVID-19 — A Weaponized Coronavirus?In this interview, Francis Boyle — whose background includes an undergraduate degree from the University of Chicago, a juris doctor (lawyer) degree from Harvard and a Ph.D. in political science — shares his theory of the origin of this novel coronavirus.For decades, he's advocated against the development and use of bioweapons, which he suspects COVID-19 is. In fact, Boyle was the one who called for biowarfare legislation at the Biological Weapons Convention of 1972, and the one who drafted the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989, which was passed unanimously by both houses of Congress and signed into law by George Bush, Sr.At the time of this recording, February 14, 2020, more than 50000 people in China had been infected with the virus. Certainly, it does not originate from infected bat soup.As a result of Boyle's antibiological warfare work, which goes back to the early days of the Reagan administration — a time in which they were using DNA genetic engineering to manufacture biological weapons — Boyle has carefully followed \"mysterious outbreaks of disease in both humans and animals around the world\" that have appeared since then.\"My biowarfare antiterrorism act was specifically designed to not only to deal with regular biological weapons but also with DNA genetic engineering for biological weapons that was just coming into its infancy when the BWC was being drafted.Even though the BWC would cover DNA genetic engineering, I wanted to make it clear by name that it was covered. I also made it clear [that] it covered synthetic biology as well,\" Boyle says.\"So, when these unexplained mysterious illnesses break out, I monitor them a while and usually I just conclude they can be explained by normal reasons: lack of sanitation, poverty, things of that nature. But in Wuhan it seemed pretty suspicious to me.There is this Biosafety Level 4 facility there in Wuhan. It's the first in China, and it was specifically set up to deal with the coronavirus and SARS. SARS is basically a weaponized version of the coronavirus.There have been leaks before of SARS out of this facility, and indeed the only reason for these BSL-4 facilities, based on my experience, is the research, development, testing and stockpiling of offensive biological weapons.For that reason, I stated my opinion: That this Wuhan coronavirus leaked out of that BSL-4 facility … maybe mid-November … and the Chinese government has been lying about it and covering up ever since.\"Many Unknowns Remain. The first reported case of COVID-19 infection was December 1, 2019. Depending on the incubation period, which is still unknown, the initial lead, provided there was one, might have occurred anywhere in November. The official estimate is a 14-day incubation period, but a British health expert believes it's 24 days, and North Korean biological warfare experts believe it's 30 days, Boyle says.\"As for Wuhan and Hubei Province, they're basically under martial law. There's no other word for it. If you read the statements by President Xi and his assistants, they've made it very clear they're at war here, and that is correct. They're at war with their own biological warfare agent.President Xi just fired the party apparatchiks in charge of this and has brought in trusted military personnel to handle it, as well as large numbers of PLA [People's Liberation Army] forces saying they're health care workers. They don't look like health care workers to me. So, as of now, that's my best reading of the situation.\"\n",
      "When asked about rumors the COVID-19 virus might have been stolen from a high-security laboratory in Winnipeg, Canada, Boyle says:\"It could have been. I want to make it clear that, in my opinion they were already working on that at the Wuhan BSL-4 facility. They were working on a biological warfare weapon involving SARS, which is a coronavirus to begin with.We do know that Dr. [Yoshihiro] Kawaoka at the University of Wisconsin … resurrected the Spanish flu virus for the Pentagon, obviously for weapons purposes, and he specializes in mating the Spanish flu virus to all sorts of hideous biowarfare instrumentalities. And there was a record of him shipping his products to Winnipeg.\n",
      "Winnipeg is Canada's equivalent of our own Fort Detrick. It's a BSL-4 facility, and yes, they research, develop tests, manufacture and stockpile every type of hideous biological warfare weapon that we know of. So, some of this technology could have been stolen from Winnipeg. I don't know about that but, as I said, the Wuhan BSL-4 was already working on this to begin with.They had already developed SARS. SARS had leaked out two to three times before this, and it seems they were turbocharging SARS, which is what [COVID-19] looks to be. This is a brand-new generation of biowarfare weapons we haven't seen before.Its lethality goes from 15%, as estimated by Lancet, up to 17% to 18% by a British health official and even Chinese statistics. Its infectivity is 83%. It can infect maybe three to four people for every person infected.It has gain of function properties, which means it travels through air at least 6 or 7 feet, and … there are reports that even contaminated human feces give it off, that the human feces radiate off maybe 6 or 7 feet. So, we've never seen anything like this before in the history of biological warfare, at least in the public record.\n",
      "I want to make it clear: I have never worked for the United States government. I've never had a security clearance. I've never had access to any type of secret information.I just read what is in the public record and the scientific record and try to draw my own conclusions, and that's what I'm giving you today. I could change my opinion if people can provide me reputable scientific evidence to the contrary.Right now, I'm standing by my conclusion that it leaked out of the Wuhan BSL-4, the highest level of the Chinese government has known about it, they've been covering it up from the get-go, until they informed the WHO at the end of December.\"Despite Laws, Biowarfare Experimentation Is Alive and Well. As noted by Boyle, the Wuhan lab is a designated WHO research lab, which may sound odd, considering these facilities specialize in developing and researching dangerous pathogens that can easily be turned into bioweapons. According to Boyle, we should not be surprised however, as \"WHO is up to its eyeballs in this type of work and has been for quite some time.\" The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the drug industry also appear to have had their hand in many of the outbreaks of what appear to be weaponized viruses.\n",
      "\"I won't go through the long history of big pharma getting involved in this. There's huge amounts of money here. I believe the West Africa Ebola pandemic originated out of the US BSL-4 facility in Sierra Leone, and [that] they were testing out a so-called vaccine that contained live Ebola and gave it to these poor people,\" Boyle says.\"As for the CDC, it has been involved in every … BSL-4 biological warfare death science you could possibly imagine … It's a matter of public record that during the Reagan administration, the CDC and the American Type Culture Collection sent 40 shipments of weapons-grade biological warfare agents to Saddam Hussein in Iraq, in the hope and expectation that he would weaponize these agents and use them against Iran.Of course, the problem is that when that war was over … an order was given to U.S. military forces to blow up Saddam Hussein's biological warfare facilities, and that's not how you deal with biological warfare weapons. [It] contaminated our own troops, and that was a causative factor in the Gulf War Syndrome that … murdered about 11000 U.S. troops and disabled about 100000.\"According to Boyle, the U.S. government spent $100 billion on biological warfare programs since September 11, 2011, up until October 2015, which is no small sum. To put it into perspective, the U.S. spent $40 billion (assuming a constant dollar value) on the Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bomb. Boyle also estimates the U.S. has some 13000 life scientists working within the biowarfare industry.\"Clearly, the Reagan administration, under the influence of its neoconservatives who definitely believe in biological weapons and ethnic-specific biological weapons (you can see that in the PNAC report), were engaged in the use of DNA genetic engineering for the purpose of manufacturing biological weapons.That is why I gave a Congressional briefing in Washington, D.C. in 1985. I was asked to do that by the Council for Responsible Genetics that I work with, which involves the leading life scientists in the world from MIT and Harvard.I spent seven years at Harvard. I have three degrees and I knew all these people. They asked me to serve as their lawyer and give this Congressional briefing. I blew the whistle, and then they asked me to draft the implementing legislation, which I did.I want to make it clear I'm not here to speak in their name, I'm only speaking in my name, but if you look at my book, 'Biological Warfare and Terrorism,' professor Jonathan King wrote the foreword. So, I have the leading MIT professor of molecular biology supporting what I'm saying, if you don't think I know enough science about it.\"US Prepares for COVID-19 Pandemic. While there have so far only been a limited number of reported cases of COVID-19 infection in the U.S., the U.S. military has designated several detention sites around the country to quarantine Americans,8 should the situation take a turn for the worse.Historically speaking, however, government health officials have been vastly exaggerating the threat of pandemics in the U.S., including the bird flu, the swine flu, anthrax and Ebola.For example, as detailed in my 2009 New York Times bestseller \"The Great Bird Flu Hoax,\" then-President George Bush Jr. projected 2 million Americans would die from bird flu; the best-case scenario taking only 200000 lives. The final death count in the U.S. from that pandemic was zero.It generated massive profits, though, as U.S. taxpayer dollars were used to purchase 20 million doses of Tamiflu. One of the people who was able to line his pockets from that hoax was defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who was president of Gilead Sciences when the drug was created.\"[The bird flu] was another DNA, genetically engineered biological warfare weapon,\" Boyle notes. \"It was a chimera. It had three different elements in it and we were all lucky that somehow they attenuated the lethality and the infectiveness of the bird flu.\"Whether or not COVID-19 will be similarly ineffective in its spread and lethality remains to be seen. Judging by the statistics in China, \"it doesn't look very good,\" Boyle says.Understanding the COVID-19 Virus. According to Boyle, the COVID-19 virus is a chimera, like the avian flu virus before it. It includes SARS, an already weaponized coronavirus, along with HIV genetic material. \"That was in a published article by Indian scientists. You could see the pictures right there, [but] political pressure was brought to bear upon them so they withdrew [the paper].\"This is why some scientists are now looking into using HIV drugs to treat it,9 Boyle says. COVID-19 may also have a flu virus mixed in, along with gain of function properties that allow it to spread a greater distance than normal.Pandemics Repeatedly Used to Further Police State. Pandemics have also been used to chip away public freedoms. For example, the anthrax scare of 2001 was used as the impetus for signing the Patriot Act, which was the first step in taking away many of our personal freedoms and rolling out a complete surveillance state. To me, such outcomes are far more concerning than the risk of infection itself. Boyle adds:\"They used Amerithrax to ram the Patriot Act through, that is correct … We became a police state … And as I pointed out in 'Biowarfare and Terrorism,' I think the same people who were behind the 9/11 terrorist attack were also behind the Amerithrax, but I'm just connecting dots there. What's called Amerithrax came out of a U.S. government biological warfare weapons lab and program, and I publicly blew the whistle on that the first weekend of November 2001.The Council for Responsible Genetics was having its convention at Harvard Business School and I was chairing a panel with King and other experts on biological warfare, on U.S. biological warfare programs.As I was walking into the Harvard Divinity School, Fox TV had a camera crew there and I said, 'Obviously, this came out a U.S. biological weapons program and probably Fort Detrick.'I conducted the session and made the same comment. Then I made a comment to a Washington, D.C., radio station to that effect [and to] the BBC, so everyone in the world heard me.At that point, someone gave an order that I was never to be interviewed again by any mainstream news about biological warfare programs. And that's been the case since the first week of November 2001.\"As noted by Boyle, George Orwell's book, \"1984,\" has become reality. Boyle has since lectured lawyers at DePaul Law School in Chicago about the totalitarian nature of the Patriot Act.\"Snowden has correctly pointed out the federal government is spying on everything we say, all of our electronic communications, you name it,\" Boyle says.\"And again, the proof is I've been completely blackballed out of U.S. media. Indeed, if you go back and look at the Amerithrax attacks, they also hit mainstream U.S. media to make it clear to them that if they covered this issue they will be killed too.\"Bioweapons Are Developed To Be Used. As noted by Boyle, the U.S. government has a large stockpile of Amerithrax — a super weapons-grade nanotechnology anthrax with 1 trillion spores per gram — and that's just the tip of the iceberg of the biological weapons developed. What's more, Boyle has no doubt these weapons will eventually be put to use, as they have in the past. He says:\"There was a tabletop exercise at John Hopkins University last fall … on coronavirus.10 Tabletop exercise, that's a euphemism for a war game. Their estimate was that it killed 65 million people11. John Hopkins is up to their eyeballs in this Nazi biological warfare dirty work. They have a BSL-3 facility there … that they proudly announce on their website … They justify it by saying they're developing vaccines. OK … How do they do that?They go out around the world, and this is a matter of public record, and scour for every type of hideous disease, fungus, virus and bacteria you can possibly imagine. They then bring it back to these BSL-4 labs and develop an offensive, biological agent using DNA genetic engineering and synthetic biology … set up by the Pentagon under DARPA. Once they have this offensive agent, they then proceed to develop a vaccine, because the agent is no good unless you can have a vaccine to protect your own people.So, they're developing vaccines to have biological weapons, because a biological weapon consists of two elements: the offensive biological warfare agent in the first place, and then, second, a vaccine to protect your own people, and that is what is being done at all these BSL-4 facilities, and many of the BSL-3s as well.John Hopkins has a BSL-3 and they admit they do dual use. That's what dual use means. They first develop the offensive biological warfare agent and then they develop the supposed vaccine.\"Indeed, Johns Hopkins University is the biggest recipient of research grants from federal agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation and Department of Defense. It has also received millions of dollars in research grants from the Gates Foundation.12 In 2016, Johns Hopkins spent more than $2 billion on research projects, leading all U.S. universities in research spending for the 38th year in a row.How Can We Best Prevent or Treat COVID-19 Infection?While it's unclear exactly which treatment is the most effective, my guess is that Dr. Paul Marik's intravenous vitamin C protocol for sepsis would be a good starting point, seeing how sepsis appears to be what kills those who succumb to a serious COVID-19 infection.Marik's retrospective before-after clinical study1415 showed that giving patients IV vitamin C with hydrocortisone and vitamin B1 for two days reduced mortality from 40% to 8.5%. The precise protocol used was 200 mg of thiamine every 12 hours, 1500 mg of ascorbic acid every six hours, and 50 mg of hydrocortisone every six hours.16 Importantly, the treatment has no side effects and is inexpensive, readily available and simple to administer.According to Marik, vitamin C and corticosteroids have a synergistic effect,17 which is part of why his combo protocol is so effective. Still, simply using high-dose IV vitamin C exclusively has been shown to improve survival in patients with sepsis and acute respiratory failure, reducing mortality from 46% to 30%.It also reduced the number of days they needed to remain hospitalized. On average, those who received vitamin C had by Day 28 spent three fewer days in the intensive care unit than the placebo group (seven days compared to 10). By Day 60, the treatment group had also spent seven fewer days in the hospital overall —15 days compared to 22.19. While there are no trials that look at integrating hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), my suspicion is that this would provide a powerful synergy that could get the fatality rate from sepsis even closer to zero. Sadly, HBOT is not available at many hospitals, and even if it were, it is not approved for sepsis.Bioweapons Expert Speaks Out About Novel Coronavirus\n",

      "5G DANGERSCONSPIRACYCONTROLCORONAVIRUSThere’s A Connection Between Coronavirus And 5GHAFFebruary 19, 2020\n",
      "Sponsored by RevcontentTrending Now. The China Coronavirus 5G Connection is a very important factor when trying to comprehend the coronavirus (formerly abbreviated 2019-nCoV, now COVID-19) outbreak. Various independent researchers around the web, for around 2-3 weeks now, have highlighted the coronavirus-5G link despite the fact that Google (as the self-appointed NWO Censor-in-Chief) is doing its best to hide and scrub all search results showing the connection. The coronavirus 5G connection doesn’t mean the bioweapons connection is false (it’s not a case of either-or), but rather broadens the scope of the entire event. Wuhan was one of the test cities chosen for China 5G rollout; 5G went live there on October 31st, 2019, almost exactly 2 months before the coronavirus outbreak began. Meanwhile, many scientific documents on the health effects of 5G have verified that it causes flu-like symptoms. This article reveals the various connections behind the coronavirus phenomenon, including how 5G can exacerbate or cause the kind of illness you are attributing to the new virus. The rabbit hole is deep so let’s take a dive. 5G – A Type Of Directed Energy Weapon\n",
      "For the deeper background to 5G, read my 2017 article 5G and IoT: Total Technological Control Grid Being Rolled Out Fast. Many people around the world, including concerned citizens, scientist and even governmental officials, are becoming aware of the danger of 5G. This is why it has already been banned in many places worldwide, such as Brussels, the Netherlands and parts of Switzerland, Ireland, Italy, Germany, the UK, the USA and Australia. After all, 5G is not just the next generation of mobile connectivity after 4G; it is a radical and entirely new type of technology – a military technology used on the battlefield that is now being ‘deployed’ (military term) in the civilian realm. It is phased array weaponry being sold and disguised as primarily a communications system when the frequency bands it uses (24GHz – 100+GHz including MMW [millimeter waves]) are the very same ones used in Active Denial Systems, i.e. crowd control. Even mainstream Wikipedia describes Active Denial Systems as directed energy weaponry; it disperses crowds by firing energy at them, causing immediate and intense pain, including a sensation of the skin burning. Remember, directed energy weapons (DEW) are behind the fall of the Twin Towers on 9/11 and the fake Californian ‘wildfires’. Numerous scientists have warned of the dangerous health effects of 5G. For instance, in this 5G Appeal from 2017 entitled Scientists and Doctors Warn of Potential Serious Health Effects of 5G, scientists warned of the harmful of non-ionizing RF/EMF radiation: “Effects include increased cancer risk, cellular stress, increase in harmful free radicals, genetic damages, structural and functional changes of the reproductive system, learning and memory deficits, neurological disorders, and negative impacts on general wellbeing in humans. Damage goes well beyond the human race, as there is growing evidence of harmful effects to both plants and animals.” If you listen to Mark Steele and Barrie Trower, you’ll get an idea of the horrifying effects of 5G. In this interview, Trower echoes the above quote by stating how 5G damages the immune system of trees and kills insects. He reveals how in 1977, 5G was tested on animals in hopes of finding a weapon. The results were severe demyelination – stripping the protective sheath of nerve cells. Some nations are now noticing a 90% loss of insects (including pollinating insects like bees) which congregate around lamp-posts where 5G is installed. Wuhan Military Games And Event 201 Simulation If you dig deep enough, some disturbing connections arise between 5G and the men who have developed or are developing vaccines for novel viruses like ebola, zika and the new coronavirus COVID-19. In a fantastic piece of research, an author under the pen name of Annie Logical wrote the article Corona Virus Fakery And The Link To 5G Testing that lays out the coronavirus 5G connection. There is a ton of information, so I will break it all down to make it more understandable. From October 18-27th 2019, Wuhan hosted the Military World Games and specifically used 5G (for the first time ever) for the event. Also on October 18th, 2019 in New York, the Johns Hopkins Center in partnership with World Economic Forum (WEF) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation hosted Event 201 – “A Global Pandemic Exercise” which is a simulation of a pandemic.Guess what virus they happen to choose for their ‘simulation’? A coronavirus! Guess what animal cells they use? Pig cells! (COVID-19 was initially reported to be derived from a seafood market, and the fish there are known to be fed on pig waste). Event 201 includes the UN (since the WEF now has a partnership agreement with UN), Big Pharma (Johnson and Johnson), Bill Gates (key figure in pushing vaccines, human microchipping and Agenda 2030) and both China and America’s CDC. Participants in Event 201 recommended that governments force social media companies to stop the spread of ‘fake news’ and that ultimately the only way to control the information would be for the WHO (World Health Organization, part of the UN) to be the sole central purveyor of information during a pandemic. Inovio, Electroporation And 5G As reported on January 24th, 2020, US biotech and pharmaceutical company Inovio received a $9 million grant to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus. Inovio got the money grant from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), however they already have an existing partnership with CEPI; in April 2018 they got up to $56 million to develop vaccines for Lassa Fever and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). CEPI was founded in Davos by the governments of Norway and India, the Wellcome Trust … and the participants of Event 201: the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the WEF. CEPI’s CEO is the former director of BARDA (US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority) which is part of the HHS. Inovio claimed they developed a coronavirus vaccine in 2 hours! On the face of it such a claim is absurd; what is more likely is that they are lying or that they already had the vaccine because they had the foreknowledge that the coronavirus was coming and was about to be unleashed. So who owns and runs Inovio? Two key men are David Weiner and Dr. Joseph Kim. Weiner was once Kim’s university professor. Weiner was involved with developing a vaccine for HIV and zika (you can read my articles about zika here and here where I exposed some of the lies surrounding that epidemic). Kim was funded by Merck (a large Big Pharma company) and produced something called Porcine Circovirus (PCV 1 and PCV 2). As mentioned above, there is a link between pig vaccines/pig DNA and the coronavirus; Annie Logical notes that it “has long been established that seafood in the area is fed on pig waste.” Kim served a 5-year tenure as a member of the WEF’s Global Agenda Council – yet another organ pushing the New World Order One World Government under the banner of Agenda 2030 Global Governance. Weiner is an employee and advisor to the FDA, is considered a DNA technology expert and pioneered a new DNA transference method called electroporation – a microbiology technique which uses an electrical pulse to create temporary pores in cell membranes through which substances like chemicals, drugs or DNA can be introduced into the cell. This technique can be used to administer DNA vaccines, which inject foreign DNA into a host’s cells that changes the host’s DNA. This means if you take a DNA vaccine, you are allowing your DNA to be changed! As if vaccines weren’t already horrific enough … but here’s the kicker: electroporation uses pulsed waves. Guess what else uses pulsed waves? 5G! This is either a startling coincidence or evidence or a sinister coronavirus 5G-connection. Annie writes:“. he same action that 5G technology uses in pulsed waves and the coronavirus was reported to have started in an area in China that had rolled out 5G technology! “So we can see how geneticists using scientists are tampering with the building blocks of our existence and what is disturbing is that Prof Wiener is a HIV pioneer and we know that soon after the Polio vaccines were given to millions in Africa that HIV emerged. They have perfected the art of injecting animal or bird DNA into human chromosomes which alters our DNA and causes things like haemorrhaging, fever, cancers and even death.”Speaking of HIV (which is not the same things as AIDS, but that is another story), remember also that a group of Indian scientists put out their research that the virus was manmade and had HIV inserts. They found that 4 separate HIV genes were randomly embedded within the coronavirus. These genes somehow converged to create receptor sites on the virus that were identical to HIV, which was a surprise due to their random placement. They also specifically stated that this was not likely to happen naturally (“unlikely to be fortuitous in nature”). In yet another example of egregious censorship, these scientists were pressured to withdraw their work. 5G And Electroporation DNA Vaccines – Both Producing Pulsed EMF Waves Consider the implications of this for a moment. The technology exists to use EMFs to open your very skin pores and inject foreign DNA into your bloodstream and cells. This is an extreme violation of your bodily sovereignty, and it can have long-term effects, because of genetic mutation – changing your very DNA which is the biological blueprint and physical essence of who you are. What if 5G mimics electroporation? What if 5G can do on a large scale what electroporation does on a small scale? We already know that 5G has the potential to be mutagenic (DNA-damaging). The frequencies that 5G uses, especially 75-100GHz, interact with the geometrical structure of our skin and sweat ducts, acting upon them like a transmission reaching an antenna, and fundamentally affecting us and our mood. What if 5G is being used to open up the skin of those in Wuhan so as to allow the new bioweapon coronavirus to infiltrate more easily? Mandatory Vaccines, Depopulation And Transhumanism So, what’s at the bottom of the coronavirus-5G connection rabbit hole? I would suggest we find mandatory vaccine agenda, the depopulation agenda and transhumanist agenda (via DNA vaccines). The key figures and groups who appear to have planned this already have the vaccine in place, just as they did for the other epidemics that fizzled out (SARS, ebola and zika). Weiner even has links to HIV/AIDS, and if you dive into that as Jon Rappoport did, you find gaping holes in that story. It’s the same epidemic / pandemic game played out every 2-3 years. There’s a couple of versions. In the first version, you invent a virus, hype it up, get people scared, do ineffectual and inconclusive tests (e.g. like the PCR test which measures if a viral fragment is present but doesn’t tell you the quantities of whether it would actually causing the disease), inflate the body count, justify quarantine/martial law and brainwash people into thinking they have to buy the (toxic) vaccine and introduce mandatory vaccination. You don’t even need a real virus or pathogen for the version. In the second version, you create a virus as a bioweapon, release it as a test, pretend it was a natural mutation, watch how many people it kills (which helps with the eugenics and depopulation agendas), again justify martial law, again justify the need for mandatory vaccines and even pose as the savior with the vaccine that stops it. As a variation on this second version, you can even develop a race-specific bioweapon so as to reduce the population of rival nations or enemy races as a geopolitical strategy. This article suggests that the coronavirus targets Chinese people / Asians more than others, and certainly the official death count attests to that, although it’s always hard to trust governmental statistics. Annie Logical gives her take: “The con job goes like this. Step 1) poison the population purposely to create disease that does not and would never occur naturally Step 2) parlay the purposely created disease as being caused by something invisible, outside the realm of control or knowledge of the average person Step 3) create a toxic vaccine or medication that was always intended to further poison the population into an early grave Step 4) parlay the vaccine or medication poisoning as PROOF the disease, which never existed, is much worse than anticipated Step 5) increase the initial poisoning, which is marketed as a fake disease, and also increase the vaccine and medication poisoning, to start piling the bodies into the stratosphere Step 6) repeat as many times as possible upon an uninformed population because killing a population this way (the art of having people line up to kill themselves with poison……known as a “soft kill” method) is the only legal way to make sure such eugenic operations can be executed on mass and in plain sight.“ DNA vaccines are a disturbing new advancement for transhumanism. After all, the objective of the transhumanist agenda is to merge man with machine, and in doing so, wipe out what fundamentally makes us human, so we can be controlled and overtaken by a deeply sinister and negative force. It’s all about changing us at the fundamental level, or attacking human sovereignty itself. DNA vaccines fit right in with that – literally changing your DNA by forcefully inserting foreign DNA to change your genetics, with consequences no one could possibly fully foresee and predict. One Last Coronavirus – 5G Connection Finally, I will finish with another coronavirus-5G connection. The word coronavirus itself refers to many kinds of viruses by that name, not just COVID-19. Guess who owns a patent for a coronavirus strain that can be used to develop a vaccine? The Pirbright Institute. And guess who partially owns them? Bill Gates! As you can read here Pirbright is being supported in their vaccine developement endeavors by a British company Innovate UK … who also funds and supports the rollout of 5G. Innovate UK ran a competition in 2018 with a £15 million share out to any small business that could produce vaccines for ‘epidemic’ potential.The Motivation To Hype And The Motivation To Downplay History has shown that in cases of epidemics (or fake epidemics) there is almost always a morass of conflicting reports and contradictory information. In such situations, it can be very difficult to get to the bottom of the matter and find the truth. The conflict stems from the different motivations of nations, governments and other interested groups. Essentially, there are 2 main motivations: the motivation to hype (exaggerate and use fear to grab attention, sell something, make a group look bad/incompetent, make people scared, make the public accept mandatory vaccination and martial law) and the motivation to downplay (cover up and hide the true extent of the damage, morbidity or mortality so as to appear competent and in control, to lessen possible anger, backlash or disorder). Sometimes, these 2 motivations may drive the behavior of the same group, e.g. in the case of the Chinese Government, it has the motivation to hype (to get people afraid so they easily follow its draconian quarantine rules) and the motivation to downplay (so as to appear in the eyes of its people and the rest of the entire world to have the situation under control, to ensure saving face, credibility and a good reputation). Final Thoughts On The Coronavirus 5G Connection. Governments around the world have experimented with bioweapons both on their own citizens and foreign citizens, and even sold that research to other governments for their own benefit (e.g. Japan’s notorious Unit 731 which developed bioweapons in China, only to hand over that research to the US after losing World War 2). See Bioweapons: Lyme Disease, Weaponized Ticks, Plum Island & More for a brief history of the USG’s usage of weaponized ticks which resulted in Lyme Disease. The evidence that COVID-19 is a bioweapon is overwhelming – and so is the evidence that 5G is involved to either cause the flu-like symptoms/pneumonia people have been experiencing, and/or to exacerbate the virulity of the virus by weakening people’s immune systems and subjecting them to pulsed waves of EMF to open up their skin to foreign DNA fragments (including viruses). In this kinds of story, there are no major coincidences – only connections and conspiracies waiting to be uncovered. You can learn more on the subject by reading the book “The Dark Side of Prenatal Ultrasound and the Dangers of Non-Ionizing Radiation“.There’s A Connection Between Coronavirus And 5G\n",

      "The hype and disinformation campaign about the spread of the new COVID-19 coronavirus has created a climate of fear and uncertainty around the world since WHO declared it a medical emergency. international public health on January 30. The fear campaign is underway, creating panic and uncertainty. National governments and WHO mislead the public.\"About 84000 people in at least 56 countries have been infected and about 2900 have died,\" said the New York Times. What the newspaper fails to mention is that 98% of infections are in mainland China. There are fewer than 5000 confirmed cases outside of China (WHO, February 28, 2020). At the moment, there is no real pandemic outside of mainland China. The numbers speak for themselves. At the time of this writing, the number of \"confirmed cases\" in the US is 64 .The number is minimal, but the media is spreading panic.There are however 15 million cases of influenza in the USA .The latest FluView surveillance report from the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicates that on January 18, 2020, there were 15 million influenza cases, 140000 hospitalizations and 8200 deaths in this influenza season in the USA (emphasis added ). COVID-19 Pandemic Data On February 28, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 83652 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 78961 in mainland China. Outside China, there were 4691 (WHO, February 28, 2020, see table on the right). WHO also reported 2791 deaths, including only 67 outside of mainland China .These figures confirm that the pandemic is mainly confined to mainland China. In addition, recent data tend to show that the epidemic in China is under control. On February 21, 2020, the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China reported that 36157 patients were declared cured and discharged from hospital (see chart below).Chinese reports confirm that people have received treatment and are recovering from the viral infection. The number of infected patients is also decreasing. According to the National Pharmaceutical Administration of China, hospitals use the antiviral drug Favilavir \"to treat coronavirus with minimal side effects\".Let's look at the numbers:The world population is around 7.8 billion people.The population of China is around 1.4 billion people.The world population minus China is around 6.4 billion people.4691 confirmed cases and 67 reported deaths (outside of China) out of a population of 6.4 billion do not constitute a pandemic. 4691 / 6400000000 = 0.00000073 = 0.000073%. In the USA, 64 cases out of a population of around 330 million do not constitute a pandemic. (data from February 28): 64 / 330000000 .Why propaganda? Racism against people of Chinese origin. A deliberate campaign against China has been launched and a wave of racist sentiments against people of Chinese origin is underway, largely peddled by the Western media.The Economist  reports that \"The coronavirus spreads racism against people of Chinese origin and also among themselves.\"Fear of covid-19 causes people to behave badly, including some Chinese.\"The Chinese community in Great Britain is facing racism because of the coronavirus epidemic\" according to the SCMP.“Chinese communities abroad are increasingly facing racist abuse and discrimination in the context of the coronavirus epidemic. Some people of Chinese origin living in the UK say they have been the victims of growing hostility due to the deadly virus from China.The New York Times reported on March 30 that President Trump backed down from his previous statement that by April 12, the COVID-19 lockout should be over and it's time to think about \" back to work \". Instead, he said an extension until the end of April was necessary - and perhaps even until June. This, he said, followed the advice of his advisers, including Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), within the National Institute for Health (NIH), The COVID-19 virus has so far caused far fewer infections and deaths than regular flu in recent years. The WHO reported on March 30, 750000 infections worldwide and 36000 deaths. In the United States, there are approximately 161000 cases and 3000 deaths. Yet whistleblower Fauci says there could be millions of cases of coronavirus in the United States and 100000 to 200000 deaths. And, coincidentally, Bill Gates does the same, using roughly the same numbers.\n",
      "All this with the idea of ​​imposing a vaccine on the population.A multi-billion dollar vaccine is not necessary.NIAD and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation are collaborating to develop a COVID-19 vaccine.China has shown that the COVID-19 virus can be brought under control at relatively low cost and with strict discipline and traditional medicines. The same drugs and measures have been used for centuries to successfully prevent and cure all kinds of viral diseases.First of all, a vaccine against COVID-19, or against coronaviruses in general, is a vaccine against influenza. Vaccines do not cure. Ideally, influenza vaccines can prevent the virus from affecting a patient as much as it would without a vaccine. The effectiveness of influenza vaccines is generally evaluated between 20 and 50%. Above all, vaccines are a huge financial bonus for large pharmaceutical companies.Then here are a multitude of remedies that have proven to be very effective. See also this and that.The French Professor Didier Raoult , which is one of the five best scientists in the world in the field of communicable diseases, has suggested the use of hydroxychloroquine ( Chloroquine or Plaquenil) , a well known drug, simple and low COVID-19: More Hydroxychloroquine Data From Francecost, also used to fight malaria, which has been shown to work with previous coronaviruses such as SARS. From mid-February 2020, clinical trials at his institute and in China have already confirmed that the drug can reduce viral load and bring a dramatic improvement. Chinese scientists have published their first trials on more than 100 patients and announced that the Chinese National Health Commission would recommend chloroquine in its new guidelines for the treatment of the COVID-19 virus.China and Cuba are collaborating on the use of interferon Alpha 2B, a highly effective antiviral drug developed in Cuba for 39 years, but little known to the world, due to the embargo imposed by the United States on everything which comes from Cuba. Interferon has also been shown to be very effective in the fight against COVID-19 and is now produced in a joint venture in China. There is an old natural Indian / Ayurvedic medicine, curcumin, which comes in the form of C90 capsules. It is an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compound that has been used successfully to treat cancer, infectious diseases and, yes, coronaviruses.\n",
      "Other simple but effective remedies include the use of large doses of vitamin C , as well as vitamin D3 , or more generally the use of essential micro-nutrients to fight infections, especially vitamins A, B, C, D summer. Another remedy used for thousands of years by the ancient Chinese, Romans and Egyptians is colloidal silver products. They come in the form of a liquid to be administered orally, or to be injected, or to be applied to the skin. Colloidal silver products strengthen the immune system, fight bacteria and viruses, and have been used to treat cancer, HIV / AIDS, shingles, herpes, eye conditions, prostatitis - and COVID-19.\n",
      "A simple and inexpensive remedy to use in combination with others is the menthol-based \"Mentholatum  \" . It is used for common flu and cold symptoms. Applied on and around the nose, it acts as a disinfectant and prevents germs from entering the respiratory tract, including coronaviruses.Northern Italy and New Orleans report that an unusual number of patients had China Is Using Cuba's Interferon Alfa 2B Against Coronavirus ...to be hospitalized in intensive care units (ICUs) and placed on a 24-hour, 7-day-a-day ventilator %, some of them not reacting and falling into respiratory failure. The reported mortality rate is around 40%. This condition is called acute respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS. This means that the lungs are filled with fluid. When this description of ARDS episodes applies, Dr. Raoult and other medical colleagues recommend COVID-19 patients to \"sleep sit\" until they are cured. This allows the fluid to escape from the lungs. This method has been known for its effectiveness since it was first documented during the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic.Finally, Chinese researchers, in cooperation with Cuban and Russian scientists, are also developing a vaccine that may soon be ready for testing. This vaccine would attempt to attack not only a single strand of coronavirus, but also the basic genome of coronaviral RNA (RNA = ribonucleic acid), to prevent new mutations in coronaviruses. Unlike the West, which works exclusively for profit, the Sino-Cuban-Russian vaccine would be made available to the whole world at a low price.These alternative remedies cannot be found on the internet controlled by the major pharmaceutical companies. Internet references, if any, may discourage their use. At best, they will tell you that these products or methods have not proven to be effective, and at worst, that they can be harmful. Don't believe it. None of these products or methods are harmful. Remember that some of them have been used as natural remedies for thousands of years. And don't forget that China has successfully mastered COVID-19, using some of these relatively simple and inexpensive drugs.Few doctors know these practical, simple and inexpensive remedies. The media, under pressure from giants of the pharmaceutical industry and government agencies that comply with it, were asked to censor this valuable information. Neglect or inability to publicize these readily available remedies takes their toll.The role of Bill Gates and locking. Bill Gates may have been one of Trump's \"advisers\", suggesting that he extend the \"return to work\" date at least until the end of April, and, if Gates wants it, at least until in June. It remains to be seen. Gates is very - very powerful:Bill Gates Says US Has Missed Chance to Avoid Coronavirus Closure and Businesses Should Stay Closed. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation will be the source of the organization of mass vaccination which should be launched in the period following containment.The vaccination association includes the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations ( CEPI ), a semi-NGO, to which NIH / NIAID has entrusted the supervision of the vaccination program - with the support of Bill Gates; GAVI, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization - also a creation of Bill Gates, supported by WHO, also heavily funded by the Gates Foundation; the World Bank and UNICEF; as well as a myriad of pharmaceutical partners.Bill Gates also strongly suggests that travelers must have a vaccination certificate in their passports before boarding a plane or entering a country.The implementation of the program, including a related global electronic identity program, possibly administered using nanos chips that could be integrated into the vaccine itself, would be overseen by the little-known agency Agenda ID2020, which is also an initiative from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.Bill Gates is also known as a fervent proponent of a drastic and selective reduction of the population. Knowing what we know, who would trust any vaccine with the signature of Bill Gates. The hope that this evil enterprise will not succeed is very important. Economic war against China. The US strategy is to use COVID-19 to isolate China, despite the fact that the US economy relies heavily on Chinese imports.The short-term disorganization of the Chinese economy is largely due to the (temporary) closure of trade and transportation circuits.The public health emergency declared by the WHO is combined with media misinformation and a ban on flights to China. Panic on Wall Street. Media disinformation has taken on another dimension by causing panic on the stock markets. Fear of the coronavirus has led to a fall in financial markets around the world. According to reports, the value of the world's stock markets has plummeted by around $ 6 trillion. This decline has so far been on the order of \"15% or more\".This causes massive losses in personal savings (ie, average Americans), to which are added personal bankruptcies and corporate bankruptcies.It is also a boon for institutional speculators, especially for corporate hedge funds. The financial meltdown leads to large transfers of monetary wealth in the pockets of a handful of financial institutions.The most ironic is that analysts casually link the collapse of the markets to the spread of the virus, when there are only 64 confirmed cases in the USA.\"No wonder the markets are going down ... the virus has grown so much ...\"Could we \"predict\" the financial crash of February? It would be naive to believe that the financial crisis was only due to market forces that responded spontaneously to the spread of COVID-19. The market was already carefully manipulated by powerful players who use speculative instruments in the derivatives markets, including \"short selling\". The unspoken objective is the concentration of wealth. It was quite a financial boon for the \"insiders\" who knew in advance what would lead to WHO's decision to declare a public health emergency of international concern on January 30.Was the COVID-19 (nCoV-2019) pandemic known in advance? What are the likely repercussions?On October 18, 2019, the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Baltimore undertook a carefully crafted simulation exercise of a coronavirus outbreak called nCoV-2019. In the exercise called Event 201 Simulation of a Coronavirus Pandemic , we “simulated” a stock market fall of 15%. It was not \"planned\" according to event organizers and sponsors, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the World Economic Forum.The simulation carried out in October called nCoV-2019 took place barely two months before the appearance of COVID-19. John Hopkins' pandemic simulation simulated a stock market drop of \"  15% or more  \" (video, section 0.0 - 1'2 ″), which largely corresponds to the drop that really took place at the end of February 2020. Many aspects of this \"simulation exercise\" actually correspond to what actually happened when the Director-General of WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020. What needs to be understood is that those who sponsored the John Hopkins Center “simulation exercise” are powerful and knowledgeable in the areas of “global health” (B. and M. Gates Foundation) and \"The world economy\" (GEF).It should also be noted that WHO initially adopted a similar acronym (to denote the coronavirus) to that of the John Hopkins Center Pandemic Simulation Exercise ( nCoV-2019 ) before changing it to COVID-19. Corruption and the role of WHO.What motivated the WHO Director General, Dr.  Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , to declare that the Ncov-2019 is a \"public health emergency of international concern\" on 30 January, when the epidemic was largely confined to mainland China?Everything suggests that the Director General of WHO Tedros served the interests of powerful corporate partners.According to F. William Engdahl , Tedros has long-standing ties to the Clintons and the Clinton Foundation. He is also closely linked to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Along with the World Economic Forum in Davos, the Gates Foundation sponsored the John Hopkins nCoV-2019 “simulation exercise”.As Minister of Health, Tedros also chaired the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, of which the Gates Foundation was the co-founder. The Global Fund has been marred by fraud and corruption scandals. \"During the three-year campaign by Tedros to get his post at WHO, he was accused of hiding three major cholera epidemics while he was Ethiopia's Minister of Health, falsely qualifying the cases \"acute watery diarrhea\" (a symptom of cholera), to minimize the scale of the epidemic, an accusation he denied. (Engdahl, op. Cit.).A massive vaccine development campaign has been ordered by WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Many pharmaceutical companies are already working on it.In this regard, it is important to recall the fraud of the WHO during the mandate of its predecessor, Dr Margaret Chan , who said this about the H1N1 swine flu pandemic in 2009: Vaccine manufacturers can produce 4.9 billion influenza vaccines a year at best. ( Margaret Chan, executive director of the World Health Organization , cited by Reuters on July 21, 2009, underline added).There was no H1N1 pandemic in 2009. It was a fraud to make money, as revealed by the European Parliament. What is the next step in the COVID-19 pandemic? Is it a fake or a true pandemic?The propaganda against China is not over.Nor is the \"fear pandemic\" outside of China, despite the really low number of \"confirmed cases\".The financial crisis continues, supported by media disinformation and financial interference.If normal business relationships (and transportation) between the US and China are not restored, the delivery of \"Made in China\" consumer goods exported to the United States will be jeopardized.This situation could trigger a major crisis in the retail trade in the USA, where “Made in China” goods constitute a significant part of monthly household consumption. From a public health perspective, the prospects for eliminating COVID-19 in China are favorable. Progress has already been reported. In the rest of the world (where there were approximately 3000 confirmed cases on February 28, 2020), the COVID-19 pandemic continues, along with propaganda for a global vaccination program.Without a fear campaign combined with fake news, COVID-19 would not have made headlines.From a medical point of view, is global vaccination indicated?. 43.3% of \"confirmed cases\" in China are now considered \"recovered\" (see graph above). Western reports do not distinguish between \"confirmed cases\" and \"confirmed infected cases\". It is the latter cases that are relevant. The trend is towards a recovery and a decrease in \"confirmed infected cases\".\n",
      "The WHO massive vaccination campaign (mentioned above) was duly confirmed by its Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , on February 28:\n",
      "“… More than 20 vaccines are being developed worldwide and several therapeutic products are undergoing clinical trials, the first results of which are expected in“ a few weeks ”. (emphasis added). It goes without saying that this WHO decision constitutes another financial windfall for the five main vaccine producers: GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, Merck & Co., Sanofi, and Pfizer, which control 85% of the vaccine market. According to CNBC:  (emphasis added). These companies have entered the race to fight the deadly coronavirus and are working on programs to create vaccines or drugs ... Sanofi is teaming up with the US government to develop a vaccine against the new virus , hoping that its work on the the 2003 SARS outbreak will speed up the process. In 2019, Merck earned $ 8.4 billion in revenues from the vaccine market, a growing segment at an annual rate of 9% since 2010, according to Bernstein.GlaxoSmithKline announced this month its partnership with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations [CEPI] for a vaccination program ... CEPI was launched at the 2017 World Economic Forum.Interestingly, CEPI launched in Davos in 2017 is supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Wellcome Trust (a multi-billion dollar British humanitarian foundation) and the World Economic Forum. The governments of Norway and India are members and their role is mainly to finance CEPI.Chronology. October 18, 2019  : The B. and M. Gates Foundation and the World Economic Forum are partners in the pandemic “simulation exercise” at nCoV-2019 conducted by the John Hopkins Center for Health Security in October 2019.December 31, 2019  : China alerts the WHO to the discovery of several cases of \"unusual pneumonia\" in Wuhan, Hubei province.January 7, 2020  : Chinese officials say they have identified a new virus. WHO names the new virus 2019-nCoV ( exactly the same name as the virus which was the object of the simulation exercise of the John Hopkins Center, except the placement of the date).January 24-25, 2020  : Davos Summit under the auspices of CEPI, which is also the fruit of a partnership between the World Economic Forum and the Gates Foundation, during which the development of a vaccine against the 2019 nCoV is announced (2 weeks after the announcement of January 7, 2020 and barely a week before the declaration of a public health emergency of international scope by the WHO). January 30, 2020  : The WHO director declares a \"public health emergency of international concern\". Now a vaccination campaign has been launched to stop COVID-19 under the auspices of CEPI in partnership with GlaxoSmithKline. Conclusion. COVID-19 (aka nCoV-2019) represents a treasure worth billions of dollars for large pharmaceutical companies. But it also contributes to precipitating humanity into a dangerous process of economic, social and geopolitical destabilization.COVID-19 Coronavirus: A False Pandemic? Who is behind this?

      "We still don't fully understand how the new coronavirus spreads, but we're learning more every day.The new coronavirus has upended all of our usual calculus about seemingly ordinary activities. Is running past someone on the street safe? How about shopping in a grocery store with a 6-foot (2 meters) distance? And what about packages and takeout? And which of these activities poses the biggest risk?Unfortunately, there's a lot we still don't know about the way the virus that causes COVID-19 spreads.\"At this point, I don't think anyone can take a group of people with COVID, say how each person has become infected, and then say that xx% got infected with droplets and yy% got infected via touching surfaces,\" Dr. Jeffrey N. Martin, a professor in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of California, San Francisco, told Live Science in an email. \"I don't think this kind of study has ever been done for any infection. In most individual persons, we do not know how the person got infected.\"Respiratory transmission. While the basic outlines of disease transmission have not been upended by COVID-19, there are some nuances that could play an important role in the spread of the disease. From the beginning, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have said that SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory virus, and as such, it is mainly transmitted between people through \"respiratory droplets\" when symptomatic people sneeze or cough. This idea, that large droplets of virus-laden mucus are the primary mode of transmission, guides the CDC's advice to maintain at least a 6-foot distance between you and other people. The thinking is that gravity causes those large droplets (which are bigger than about .0002 inches, or 5 microns, in size) to fall to the ground within a distance of 6 feet from the infected person.\n",
      "But that 6-foot guideline is more of a ballpark estimate than a hard and fast rule, said Josh Santarpia, the research director of Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Program at the University of Nebraska's National Strategic Research Institute.\"There really isn't anything magic about standing 6 feet away from someone that you are interacting with directly. If you stand talking to someone who is infected with the virus, whether it's 3 feet or 6 feet, there is going to be some risk of infection,\" Santarpia told Live Science in an email. That's because even large respiratory droplets can travel fairly far if the airflow conditions are right, Santarpia said.And some experts believe the 6-foot rule is based on outdated information.\"6 feet is probably not safe enough. The 3-6 foot rule is based on a few studies from the 1930s and 1940s, which have since been shown to be wrong — droplets can travel farther than 6 feet,\" said Raina MacIntyre, a principal research fellow and professor of global biosecurity, who heads the Biosecurity Program at the Kirby Institute, in Australia. \"Yet hospital infection control experts continue to believe this rule. It's like the flat Earth theory — anyone who tries to discuss the actual evidence is shouted down by a chorus of believers.”Another complicating factor is that at least 25% of the people who are transmitting the virus may be asymptomatic at the time, said Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Live Science previously reported. That suggests coughs and sneezes aren't necessary to transmit the virus, though it's not clear whether simply breathing spreads the virus, or whether talking is required.Aerosol transmission\n",
      "In order for the virus to be spread without being coughed or sneezed in large drops of mucus, it has to somehow be able to suspend in the air for long enough to infect passersby. And that’s another complicating factor in figuring out transmission: People emit virus particles in a range of sizes, and some are small enough to be considered aerosols, or fine particles that can stay suspended in the air for hours and can travel with air currents across tens of feet. A study published March 17 in the New England Journal of Medicine found that virus particles that were aerosolized could remain viable for up to 3 hours.What's not clear from this data is whether the virus is commonly transmitted via aerosols, or how long the virus remains infectious in aerosols in real-world settings. In that study, researchers used an extremely high concentration of virus particles, which may not reflect those shed by people with the disease.\n",
      "\"To my knowledge, there is no definitive evidence of transmission where aerosol was the only possible route,\" Santarpia told Live Science. For instance, even someone who's not sneezing may emit respiratory droplets when talking, because people may spit when talking, and those droplets could be deposited on surfaces.One case study is suggestive however; a choir group in Skagit, Washington, met for a two-hour practice in early March. No one was symptomatic, so singers weren’t coughing or sneezing out infected droplets. And everyone kept their distance. But when all was said and done, 45 people became infected with COVID-19 and at least two people died from the virus, the Los Angeles Times reported. That suggested the viral particles were shed as aerosols by someone, before being inhaled or otherwise acquired by other choir members. A 2019 study in the journal Nature Scientific Reports found that people emit more aerosol particles when talking, and that louder speech volumes correlate to more aerosol particles being emitted. Fight against online child sexual abuse this National Children’s Day with the National Crime.That case, along with those studies, suggest that the virus can be routinely transmitted via aerosols, though other routes of transmission (such as large droplets being emitted during singing or speech) are still possible explanations. In the 2003 SARS outbreak, aerosol transmission occurred during hospital procedures that generated large volumes of aerosols, such as intubation. Contact transmission.There's one other route that's thought to play a role in the spread of COVID-19: contact transmission. In that situation, viral particles emitted from the respiratory tract of an infected individual land on a surface. Then, another person touches that object, then touches their nose, mouth or eyes. The virus then sneaks into the body via the mucous membranes, infecting the second person. So far, no one knows how common this mode of transmission is, but it does seem to be possible. One study found that SARS-CoV-2 could remain viable on surfaces such as cardboard for up to 24 hours, and on plastic and steel for 2 to 3 days. Santarpia has studied viral surface contamination in the context of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. In that study, which was published March 26 on the preprint database medRxiv, Santarpia and his colleagues found viral contamination in air samples, on surfaces such as toilets, and on frequently touched surfaces. Also on March 26, the CDC published a report on the coronavirus-stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship. An investigative team found traces of RNA from SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces throughout the cruise ship, in the cabins of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected passengers, up to 17 days later — though no evidence suggests this viral RNA was still infectious. SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus, meaning its main genetic material is RNA, not DNA. Another case report published by the CDC — this time from Singapore — also suggests contact with contaminated surfaces can transmit the virus. In that case, a person who was infected with SARS-CoV-2, but not yet symptomatic, attended a church service. Later in the day, another person sat in the same seat, and also came down with COVID-19. Whether the virus was contracted via a contaminated surface, or potentially a lingering aerosol, however, couldn't be ascertained.\n",
      "Is food safe?So far, there's no evidence that the virus is transmitted via food. The virus will not live long in food proper, and while it's possible that food packaging from groceries or takeout could contain small concentrations of virus particles, it is easy to mitigate this risk by washing your hands after handling groceries or takeout,Ben Chapman, a professor and food safety specialist at North Carolina State University, previously told Live Science.Related: How to shop for groceries during the COVID-19 pandemic.The takeaway?The fact that so many seemingly innocuous activities can transmit the virus can be scary. And it can be even scarier not knowing the actual risks associated with each transmission route — without that information, how can we take the right steps to protect ourselves?But ultimately, there's some reassurance in the data as well.\"What is true is that persons who have a member of their household infected with the virus have a higher probability of getting infected with COVID than people who do not have a member of their household infected. This tells us a lot. This tells us that close contact is the most important factor,\" Martin said.Briefly passing a person on the street, at a distance of 6 feet, is likely to pose a low risk of infection, Martin said. Chatting at a distance of 6 feet with that same person for a few hours will be higher risk, he said. Ultimately, social distancing is a powerful tool to cut all the hypothesized routes of transmission, experts said.\"If the other person is shedding virus into the air, the longer you stand near them, the greater the chance you have to be exposed to the virus,\" Linsey Marr, who studies the transport of air pollutants in the department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Virginia Tech, told Live Science.How are people being infected with COVID-19?\n",

      "There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus. The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person. Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet). Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Some recent studies have suggested that COVID-19 may be spread by people who are not showing symptoms. Clean your hands often. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Avoid close contact. Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Stay home as much as possible.pdf iconexternal icon. Put distance between yourself and other people. Remember that some people without symptoms may be able to spread virus. Keeping distance from others is especially important for people who are at higher risk of getting very sick. Cover your mouth and nose with a cloth face cover when around others. You could spread COVID-19 to others even if you do not feel sick. Everyone should wear a cloth face cover when they have to go out in public, for example to the grocery store or to pick up other necessities. Cloth face coverings should not be placed on young children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance. The cloth face cover is meant to protect other people in case you are infected. Do NOT use a facemask meant for a healthcare worker. Continue to keep about 6 feet between yourself and others. The cloth face cover is not a substitute for social distancing. Cover coughs and sneezes. If you are in a private setting and do not have on your cloth face covering, remember to always cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze or use the inside of your elbow. Throw used tissues in the trash. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, clean your hands with a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.Clean and disinfect Clean AND disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily. This includes tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks. If surfaces are dirty, clean them: Use detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection. To disinfect: Most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work. Use disinfectants appropriate for the surface. Options include: Diluting your household bleach. To make a bleach solution, mix: 5 tablespoons (1/3rd cup) bleach per gallon of water. OR 4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water. Follow manufacturer’s instructions for application and proper ventilation. Check to ensure the product is not past its expiration date. Never mix household bleach with ammonia or any other cleanser. Unexpired household bleach will be effective against coronaviruses when properly diluted.

      "The CDC now recommends that everyone in the US wear nonsurgical masks when going out in public.Coronavirus primarily spreads when someone breathes in droplets containing virus that are produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes or when a person touches a contaminated surface and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth. But people who are infected but do not have symptoms, or have not yet developed symptoms, can also infect others. That's where masks come in.A person infected with coronavirus — even one with no symptoms — may emit aerosols when they talk or breathe. Aerosols are infectious viral particles that can float or drift around in the air. Another person can breathe in these aerosols and become infected with the virus. A mask can help prevent that spread. An article published in NEJM in March reported that aerosolized coronavirus could remain in the air for up to three hours.What kind of mask should you wear? Because of the short supply, people without symptoms or without exposure to someone known to be infected with the coronavirus can wear a cloth face covering over their nose and mouth. They do help prevent others from becoming infected if you happen to be carrying the virus unknowingly.While N95 masks are the most effective, these medical-grade masks are in short supply and should be reserved for healthcare workers.Some parts of the US also have inadequate supplies of surgical masks. If you have a surgical mask, you may need to reuse it at this time. But never share your mask.Surgical masks are preferred if you are caring for someone who has COVID-19 or you have any respiratory symptoms (even mild symptoms) and must go out in public.Masks are more effective when they are tight-fitting and cover your entire nose and mouth. They can help discourage you from touching your face (be sure you're not touching your face more often to adjust the mask). Masks are meant to be used in addition to, not instead of, physical distancing.The CDC has information on how to make, wear, and clean nonsurgical masks.The WHO offers videos and illustrations on when and how to use a mask.Should I wear a face mask?\n",

      "It’s hard to know yet. But there are many things we can do to flatten the next wave of the contagion.Will there be another wave of Covid-19? And if so, how big will it be, and will there be more waves after it?The answer to those questions depend on seasonality, the susceptibility of the population to the disease, the rate at which the coronavirus mutates and how we come out of lockdown.Colds and influenza are seasonal because those viruses generally survive outside the body for a shorter time in high heat and high humidity than in cold weather and low humidity. People also spend more time indoors in winter, coming into close contact with others with less ventilation, so respiratory infections are far more common in winter, although of course they can sicken people in summer, too.But in 1918 and 1919, the years of the world’s deadliest pandemic, the seasons seemed to have little impact on the influenza.That pandemic had a mild first wave which began in February 1918. It struck relatively few places in the United States or around the world, followed by a lethal second wave which began in Switzerland in late July and spread rapidly around the world from September to December 1918, hitting the Northern and Southern Hemispheres simultaneously. (Australia was hit late; its rigid quarantine of arriving ships delayed the pandemic’s arrival until January 1919, the middle of its summer.) Then a third wave began in February 1919, marking two distinct pandemic waves in the same influenza season, a highly unusual occurrence.Susceptibility clearly was a more important factor than the seasons, because it turned out that the entire world — young and old people on every continent — was susceptible to the disease.Mutation was also an important factor. It probably accounts for the timing of the third wave in 1919: It seems likely that by then, the virus had changed enough that any immunity to the initial virus didn’t protect well against its mutated form. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that exposure to the first wave provided up to 89 percent protection against second wave illness (the best vaccine in the last 15 years provided 62 percent protection), but neither first nor second wave exposure protected against that third wave.What does all this mean now?Nothing is certain and little is known about Covid-19, but a few things are likely.First, modelers estimate that the true number of infected persons is up to 20 times the reported number, which still leaves about 95 percent of the population susceptible. If, as in 1918, susceptibility proves more important than seasonal influences, hot weather will not give as much relief as hoped for. By the same token, that would mean the expected seasonal surge when colder weather arrives might not be as large as feared.Second, Covid-19 mutates much more slowly than influenza, and its key spike protein — the part of the virus that attaches to cells — seems particularly stable. Amid all of the bad news that this virus has brought, this characteristic of the virus is a silver lining in several ways.Since the virus does not mutate nearly as fast as influenza, this reduces almost to zero the chance that it will become more virulent, as happened in 1918. Moreover, because the spike protein is a key part of the virus likely to be recognized by the immune system, then mutation will probably not account for a new wave soon. For the same reason, the consensus view of virologists seems to be that those who recover from the illness probably develop immunity lasting a year and possibly longer, and that a vaccine will most likely protect reasonably well against Covid-19.Third, the incubation period, on average nearly six days, is roughly triple the average incubation period of influenza, and the disease itself takes much longer for people to recover from and stop shedding virus. Therefore even without social distancing it would take months for the outbreak to pass through a community, as opposed to six to 10 weeks for influenza. With social distancing — necessary to reduce deaths by keeping hospitals from being overwhelmed — it will take even longer. Additionally, the incubation period allows an asymptomatic person more opportunity to spread disease.But these factors will give the country more time to expand testing and contact tracing, and to isolate and quarantine contacts. All of those are impossible with fast-spreading influenza.How then do we restart the economy? We cannot simply wait for herd immunity to develop from natural infection. That would take many months and be accompanied by an unacceptable death toll. Nor can we wait a year or more for a vaccine.Instead, a consensus has formed among public health experts to continue current measures until the epidemic curve bends significantly downward and the stress on health care is alleviated, followed by a phased-in approach guarded by, in effect, a public health army. That army would be fighting a guerrilla war, armed with tests, tracing, isolation and quarantine to search and destroy inevitable flare-ups.This approach has worked around the world. It will work here. Covid-19 would continue to spread, but the cases would be in manageable numbers. We would see not so much distinct waves as continuous, undulating swells, broken by occasional angry whitecaps.But if we do not manage our public health response well — for instance, allowing a widespread lifting of restrictions too quickly — we could generate a storm surge that washes away everything gained so far by so much sacrifice. That seems to be what too many politicians seem willing to risk.Those politicians should consider this: In 1918, San Antonio was one of the slowest cities to close, yet one of the quickest to reopen. As a consequence, more than half of the city’s population got sick, and almost every household had at least one person ill. And Covid-19 is more contagious than influenza.It’s past time we start doing things the right way. We still lack the testing capacity and anything approaching the necessary public health army. It’s past time we start building both.Will Warm Weather Slow Coronavirus?\n",

      "The coronavirus is a very common kind of virus. It is causing an infection in the sinuses, nose or upper throat. It has first identified in the 1960s, but doctors do not know where they come from. This virus gets the name from the crown – like shape. In some cases, coronavirus can infect both animals and humans. Most types of coronaviruses spread the same way as other cold – causing viruses, through infected people sneezing and coughing; by touching the face or hands of the infected person; by touching things, such as doorknobs that infected people have touched.It is noticed that almost everyone gets a coronavirus infection at least once in their life, most likely as a child. It is noticed that the coronavirus is most common in fall and winter, but every single person can get it at any time. The most common symptoms of coronavirus include sore throat, coughing, runny nose and sometimes a fever. There are some cases when people do not know if they suffer from coronavirus, because the symptoms of this condition are very similar to others. Your doctor will make lab tests, including nose and throat cultures and blood work, to find out if your cold was caused by a coronavirus. If the coronavirus spreads to the lower respiratory tract, it can cause pneumonia, especially in older people, people with weak immune system and people with heart disease. You should know that there is no vaccine for coronavirus. You need to ask your doctor for permission about the below mentioned home remedies for coronavirus, so you will stay away from side effects and worsening of the symptoms.Home remedies for coronavirus infection prevention\n",
      "Wash your hands: It is very important to wash your hands regularly using soap and warm water. Also, you can wash your hands with an alcohol – based hand sanitizer. In this way, you will keep yourself clean and you will prevent any chance of getting the coronavirus from other people, because when people are infected it, they can cough or sneeze and transfer this virus to things that they touch. You need to wash your hands at least twenty seconds with disinfectant.void close contact with infected people: You can easily get the coronavirus if you are in contact with people who are infected. This is a reason why you should stay away from all infected people that you know. This will decrease your chances of getting infected with coronavirus. Lemon tea: The lemon tea is prepared using black tea or green tea and by adding the right amount of lemon juice to it. There are some studies in which are shown that the lemon tea can help in the treatment of flu. This home remedy can help to kill the infection from the passageway and it can remove the symptoms of the coronavirus infection, like sore throat.Do not smoke: It is known that smoke can worsen the symptoms of coronavirus, so you need to quit smoking and avoid going to smoking areas as much as possible. Basil: When you suffer from coronavirus, then it is very important to have a good detoxification. The attack of this virus is contagious. You need to dissolve one to two teaspoons of honey in one cup of basil tea. You need to drink this type of tea, because it can help you in the fight against coronavirus. Drink plenty of liquids: They can help you to stay hydrated and also, they can help to flush out toxins from your body. You can add water and herbal teas in your diet.Stay home and rest: It is recommended to people who suffer from coronavirus to stay at their homes and to take a good rest. In this way, then can prevent the virus from spreading to other people and you will give your body a full recovery that it needs a lot. Clean your home: It is very important to clean and disinfect objects and surfaces at your home, so in this way you will decrease your chances of getting the coronavirus, if some family member has. Cinnamon: There are some people who have reported improvements in their condition by using the cinnamon as their natural treatment for coronavirus, but you can talk with your doctor if it will be suitable for your condition. Yoga: You can do yoga when you are affected by the coronavirus. It will give you a relaxing feeling to your body and mind, so for some period you will not think about your infection. Steamy shower: It has been noticed that the steamy shower can help to ease the sore and scratchy throat. You can get the same effect if you use a humidifier. It is your choice to decide which will work better for you. The hot shower can help you to get a relief from the pain. Mint tea: There are some studies in which are noticed that the mint tea can help to stop the runny nose and it can help in easy breathing. It is a good home remedy for the fight against coronavirus. You need to add the mint tea in your diet, so you will see improvements in your condition.Gargle with warm water: This home remedy can give you a relief from the sore throat, so you can try it as your home remedy for coronavirus. Garlic: This natural cure has antibacterial and antiviral properties which can help in the fight against flu. You need to take a couple of fresh garlic cloves early in the morning, or you can take garlic supplements. Have your own towel: It is very important to have your own towel, because the person infected with coronavirus can spread it with the touch and you can easily get it. When you have a clean towel that is used just by you, then you will be sure that you are healthy. Use a tissue: When you are coughing and sneezing, you need to use a tissue, so in care you are infected with the coronavirus, you will not transmit it to other people. Menthol: This is component in many different formulations for relieving the cough and cold. You can add menthol in hot water and perform steam inhalation. It will give you a relief from the coughing and nasal congestion.Oregano oil: You can use oregano oil as your home remedy for the coronavirus, because it can help with the symptoms. It is important to remember not ingesting oregano oil and just to inhale it. Thoroughly cook: You need to thoroughly cook the meat and eggs, because the coronavirus can be spread through them, so in this way you will minimize your chances of getting it. Avoid unprotected contact with animals: It is known fact that coronavirus can affect animals too. This is a reason why you need to avoid having unprotected contact with farm animals or wild animals. Wear a mask: When someone suffers from respiratory infection, then he or she needs to wear a mask, because it can help to protect people around him or her from illnesses. When you wear a surgical mask, then it can somewhat protect you from an infection in a crowd if there is an outbreak. But in general, surgical masks are not closefitting enough to filter all the air you are breathing in. Throw used tissues: If you have used a tissue, then you need to throw it in the garbage, so you will reduce the risk of transferring the coronavirus to other people.Keep your hands away: It is very important not to touch your mouth, nose and eyes with your hands and fingers, especially if you have been in some area that you suspect there are infected people with coronavirus. You need to wash your hands with soap and warm water and then you can touch your face. Ginger tea: There are some studies in which are shown that the ginger tea can help to ease your headaches that are caused by the respiratory infections. You can use the ginger tea as your home remedy to relieve throats and loosen up congestion. Salad: You need to detoxify your body, so you will not allow the coronavirus to cause pneumonia in your body. You can remove the toxins from your body with the help of mixed vegetable salad. You need to use detoxifying foods, such as broccoli, cabbage, radishes and beetroot. You need to boil the mentioned ingredients and mix them gently. This is tasty and healthy home remedy which can help you in the fight against this virus. Lemon honey tea: This natural cure can help to soothe your airway passages and it can soften the rough coughs. This is a reason why you can use it as your home remedy for coronavirus. Do not doubt to add this tea in your diet as home remedy for this contagious virus.Top 10 best coronavirus infection prevention treatments\n",

      "As the new coronavirus spreads across the globe, the chances that you will be exposed and get sick continue to increase. If you've been exposed to someone with COVID-19 or begin to experience symptoms of the disease, you may be asked to self-quarantine or self-isolate. What does that entail, and what can you do to prepare yourself for an extended stay at home? How soon after you're infected will you start to be contagious? And what can you do to prevent others in your household from getting sick? What are the symptoms of COVID-19? Some people infected with the virus have no symptoms. When the virus does cause symptoms, common ones include fever, dry cough, fatigue, loss of appetite, loss of smell, and body ache. In some people, COVID-19 causes more severe symptoms like high fever, severe cough, and shortness of breath, which often indicates pneumonia. People with COVID-19 are also experiencing neurological symptoms, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, or both. These may occur with or without respiratory symptoms. For example, COVID-19 affects brain function in some people. Specific neurological symptoms seen in people with COVID-19 include loss of smell, inability to taste, muscle weakness, tingling or numbness in the hands and feet, dizziness, confusion, delirium, seizures, and stroke. In addition, some people have gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, such as loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain or discomfort associated with COVID-19. These symptoms might start before other symptoms such as fever, body ache, and cough. The virus that causes COVID-19 has also been detected in stool, which reinforces the importance of hand washing after every visit to the bathroom and regularly disinfecting bathroom fixtures.What should I do if I think I or my child may have a COVID-19 infection?First call your doctor or pediatrician for advice.If you do not have a doctor and you are concerned that you or your child may have COVID-19, contact your local board of health. They can direct you to the best place for evaluation and treatment in your area.It's best to not seek medical care in an emergency department unless you have symptoms of severe illness. Severe symptoms include high or very low body temperature, shortness of breath, confusion, or feeling you might pass out. Call the emergency department ahead of time to let the staff know that you are coming, so they can be prepared for your arrival.How do I know if I have COVID-19 or the regular flu? COVID-19 often causes symptoms similar to those a person with a bad cold or the flu would experience. And like the flu, the symptoms can progress and become life-threatening. Your doctor is more likely to suspect coronavirus if:you have respiratory symptoms and you have been exposed to someone suspected of having COVID-19, or there has been community spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 in your area.How is someone tested for COVID-19?A specialized test must be done to confirm that a person has been infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. Most often a clinician takes a swab of your nose (or both your nose and throat). New methods of testing that can be done on site will become more available over the next few weeks. These new tests can provide results in as little as 15–45 minutes. Meanwhile, most tests will still be delivered to labs that have been approved to perform the test.Some people are starting to have a blood test to look for antibodies to the COVID-19 virus. Because the blood test for antibodies doesn't become positive until after an infected person improves, it is not useful as a diagnostic test at this time. Scientists are using this blood antibody test to identify potential plasma donors. The antibodies can be purified from the plasma and may help some very sick people get better.How reliable is the test for COVID-19?In the US, the most common test for the COVID-19 virus looks for viral RNA in a sample taken with a swab from a person's nose or throat. Tests results may come back in as little as 15–45 minutes for some of the newer on-site tests; with other tests you may wait three to four days for results. If a test result comes back positive, it is almost certain that the person is infected. A negative test result is less definite. An infected person could get a so-called \"false negative\" test result if the swab missed the virus, for example, or because of an inadequacy of the test itself. We also don't yet know at what point during the course of illness a test becomes positive. If you experience COVID-like symptoms and get a negative test result, there is no reason to repeat the test unless your symptoms get worse. If your symptoms do worsen, call your doctor or local or state healthcare department for guidance on further testing. You should also self-isolate at home. Wear a mask if you have one when interacting with members of your household. And practice social distancing. What is serologic (antibody) testing for COVID-19? What can it be used for? A serologic test is a blood test that looks for antibodies created by your immune system. There are many reasons you might make antibodies, the most important of which is to help fight infections. The serologic test for COVID-19 specifically looks for antibodies against the COVID-19 virus.Your body takes at least five to 10 days after you have acquired the infection to develop antibodies to this virus. For this reason, serologic tests are not sensitive enough to accurately diagnose an active COVID-19 infection, even in people with symptoms.However, serologic tests can help identify anyone who has recovered from coronavirus. This may include people who were not initially identified as having COVID-19 because they had no symptoms, had mild symptoms, chose not to get tested, had a false-negative test, or could not get tested for any reason. Serologic tests will provide a more accurate picture of how many people have been infected with, and recovered from, coronavirus, as well as the true fatality rate.\n",
      "Serologic tests may also provide information about whether people become immune to coronavirus once they've recovered and, if so, how long that immunity lasts. In time, these tests may be used to determine who can safely go back out into the community. Scientists can also study coronavirus antibodies to learn which parts of the coronavirus the immune system responds to, in turn giving them clues about which part of the virus to target in vaccines they are developing.Serological tests are starting to become available and are being developed by many private companies worldwide. However, the accuracy of these tests needs to be validated before widespread use in the US.How soon after I'm infected with the new coronavirus will I start to be contagious? The time from exposure to symptom onset (known as the incubation period) is thought to be 3 to 14 days, though symptoms typically appear within four or five days after exposure. We don't know the extent to which people who are not yet experiencing symptoms can infect others, but it's possible that people may be contagious for several days before they become symptomatic. For how long after I am infected will I continue to be contagious? At what point in my illness will I be most contagious?People are thought to be most contagious early in the course of their illness, when they are beginning to experience symptoms. The most recent research suggests that people may continue to shed the virus and be potentially contagious for up to eight days after they are feeling better. If I get sick with COVID-19, how long until I will feel better? It depends on how sick you get. Those with mild cases appear to recover within one to two weeks. With severe cases, recovery can take six weeks or more. According to the most recent estimates, about 1% of infected persons will succumb to the disease. How long after I start to feel better will be it be safe for me to go back out in public again?\n",
      "We don't know for certain. Based on the most recent research, people may continue to shed the virus and be potentially contagious for up to eight days after they are feeling better. But these results need to be verified. Until then, even after eight days of complete resolution of your symptoms, you should still take all precautions if you do need to go out in public, including wearing a mask, minimizing touching surfaces and keeping at least 6 feet of distance away from other people. What's the difference between self-isolation and self-quarantine, and who should consider them? Self-isolation is voluntary isolation at home by those who have or are likely to have COVID-19 and are experiencing mild symptoms of the disease (in contrast to those who are severely ill and may be isolated in a hospital). The purpose of self-isolation is to prevent spread of infection from an infected person to others who are not infected. If possible, the decision to isolate should be based on physician recommendation. If you have tested positive for COVID-19, you should self-isolate.You should strongly consider self-isolation if you have been tested for COVID-19 and are awaiting test results have been exposed to the new coronavirus and are experiencing symptoms consistent with COVID-19 (fever, cough, difficulty breathing), whether or not you have been tested.You may also consider self-isolation if you have symptoms consistent with COVID-19 (fever, cough, difficulty breathing) but have not had known exposure to the new coronavirus and have not been tested for the virus that causes COVID-19. In this case, it may be reasonable to isolate yourself until your symptoms fully resolve, or until you are able to be tested for COVID-19 and your test comes back negative. Self-quarantine for 14 days by anyone with a household member who has been infected, whether or not they themselves are infected, is the current recommendation of the White House task force. Otherwise, voluntary quarantine at home by those who may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus but are not experiencing symptoms associated with COVID-19 (fever, cough, difficulty breathing). The purpose of self-quarantine (as with self-isolation) is to prevent the possible spread of COVID-19. When possible, the decision to quarantine should be based on physician recommendation. Self-quarantine is reasonable if you are not experiencing symptoms, but have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.What does it really mean to self-isolate or self-quarantine? What should or shouldn't I do?If you are sick with COVID-19 or think you may be infected with the COVID-19 virus, it is important not to spread the infection to others while you recover. While home-isolation or home-quarantine may sound like a staycation, you should be prepared for a long period during which you might feel disconnected from others and anxious about your health and the health of your loved ones. Staying in touch with others by phone or online can be helpful to maintain social connections, ask for help, and update others on your condition.Here's what the CDC recommends to minimize the risk of spreading the infection to others in your home and community. Stay home except to get medical care. Do not go to work, school, or public areas. Avoid using public transportation, ride-sharing, or taxis. Call ahead before visiting your doctor. Call your doctor and tell them that you have or may have COVID-19. This will help the healthcare provider's office to take steps to keep other people from getting infected or exposed.Separate yourself from other people and animals in your home as much as possible, stay in a specific room and away from other people in your home. Use a separate bathroom, if available. Restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would around other people. When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick. If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a face mask. Wear a face mask if you are sick, Wear a face mask when you are around other people or pets and before you enter a doctor's office or hospital. Cover your coughs and sneezes. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze and throw used tissues in a lined trash can.Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds after you sneeze. If soap and water are not available, clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Clean your hands often. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Don't share personal household items. Do not share dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, or bedding with other people or pets in your home.After using these items, they should be washed thoroughly with soap and water. Clean all \"high-touch\" surfaces every day. High touch surfaces include counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables.Clean and disinfect areas that may have any bodily fluids on them. A list of products suitable for use against COVID-19 is available here. This list has been pre-approved by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for use during the COVID-19 outbreak. Monitor your symptomsMonitor yourself for fever by taking your temperature twice a day and remain alert for cough or difficulty breathing.If you have not had symptoms and you begin to feel feverish or develop measured fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, immediately limit contact with others if you have not already done so. Call your doctor or local health department to determine whether you need a medical evaluation.\n",
      "Seek prompt medical attention if your illness is worsening, for example if you have difficulty breathing. Before going to a doctor's office or hospital, call your doctor and tell them that you have, or are being evaluated for, COVID-19.Put on a face mask before you enter a healthcare facility or any time you may come into contact with others. If you have a medical emergency and need to call 911, notify the dispatch personnel that you have or are being evaluated for COVID-19. If possible, put on a face mask before emergency medical services arrive.What types of medications and health supplies should I have on hand for an extended stay at home? Try to stock at least a 30-day supply of any needed prescriptions. If your insurance permits 90-day refills, that's even better. Make sure you also have over-the-counter medications and other health supplies on hand. Medical and health supplies, prescription medications,  prescribed medical supplies such as glucose and blood-pressure monitoring equipment, fever and pain medicine, such as acetaminophen, cough and cold medicines, antidiarrheal medication, thermometer, fluids with electrolytes, soap and alcohol-based hand sanitizer, tissues, toilet paper, disposable diapers, tampons, sanitary napkins, garbage bags. Should I keep extra food at home? What kind? Consider keeping a two-week to 30-day supply of nonperishable food at home. These items can also come in handy in other types of emergencies, such as power outages or snowstorms. canned meats, fruits, vegetables, and soups, frozen fruits, vegetables, and meat, protein or fruit bars, dry cereal, oatmeal, or granola, peanut butter or nuts, pasta, bread, rice, and other grains, canned beans, chicken broth, canned tomatoes, jarred pasta sauce, oil for cooking, flour, sugar, crackers, coffee, tea, shelf-stable milk, canned juices bottled water canned or jarred baby food and formula pet food household supplies like laundry detergent, dish soap, and household cleaner. When can I discontinue my self-quarantine? While many experts are recommending 14 days of self-quarantine for those who are concerned that they may be infected, the decision to discontinue these measures should be made on a case-by-case basis, in consultation with your doctor and state and local health departments. The decision will be based on the risk of infecting others. How can I protect myself while caring for someone that may have COVID-19? You should take many of the same precautions as you would if you were caring for someone with the flu:Stay in another room or be separated from the person as much as possible. Use a separate bedroom and bathroom, if available. Make sure that shared spaces in the home have good air flow. Turn on an air conditioner or open a window.Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60 to 95% alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry. Use soap and water if your hands are visibly dirty.Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.Extra precautions:You and the person should wear a face mask if you are in the same room.Wear a disposable face mask and gloves when you touch or have contact with the person's blood, stool, or body fluids, such as saliva, sputum, nasal mucus, vomit, urine.Throw out disposable face masks and gloves after using them. Do not reuse.First remove and throw away gloves. Then, immediately clean your hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Next, remove and throw away the face mask, and immediately clean your hands again with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer.Do not share household items such as dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, bedding, or other items with the person who is sick. After the person uses these items, wash them thoroughly.Clean all \"high-touch\" surfaces, such as counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables, every day. Also, clean any surfaces that may have blood, stool, or body fluids on them. Use a household cleaning spray or wipe.Wash laundry thoroughly.Immediately remove and wash clothes or bedding that have blood, stool, or body fluids on them.Wear disposable gloves while handling soiled items and keep soiled items away from your body. Clean your hands immediately after removing your gloves.Place all used disposable gloves, face masks, and other contaminated items in a lined container before disposing of them with other household waste. Clean your hands (with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer) immediately after handling these items.\n",
      "My parents are older, which puts them at higher risk for COVID-19, and they don't live nearby. How can I help them if they get sick?\n",
      "Caring from a distance can be stressful. Start by talking to your parents about what they would need if they were to get sick. Put together a single list of emergency contacts for their (and your) reference, including doctors, family members, neighbors, and friends. Include contact information for their local public health department.You can also help them to plan ahead. For example, ask your parents to give their neighbors or friends a set of house keys. Have them stock up on prescription and over-the counter medications, health and emergency medical supplies, and nonperishable food and household supplies. Check in regularly by phone, Skype, or however you like to stay in touch.Can I infect my pet?There have not been reports of pets or other animals becoming sick with COVID-19, but the CDC still recommends that people sick with COVID-19 limit contact with animals until more information is known.

      "Please consider the risk. We talked to Dr. Samir Sinha. He's the director of Geriatrics for the Sinai Health System and the University Health Network in Toronto. And this is what he says:Until there's a vaccine, the most vulnerable people should continue to stay home if they can. That includes grandparents over 60 like you and people with chronic illnesses.You see, people in those categories are more likely to become severely ill if they contract coronavirus. We don't want that to be you.\"I think the pandemic has been really hard for everybody, but social isolation is a particular issue for older adults,\" he says. \"One of the greatest joys for older people is seeing younger people in their lives and having intergenerational connections.\"It's a tricky balance, we know.On one hand, meaningful connections are hugely important -- they can enrich and even prolong your life. But seeing a loved one means you'll interact with people you haven't seen in weeks who've spent their isolation in a different environment than you. You have to decide whether that risk is worth it to you.Let's talk about it.Maybe you think we, your loving family members, have banned you from visiting.\"There is this tension between families where older people feel their families are being overprotective of them or infringing on their rights,\" Sinha says.It doesn't have to be a stalemate. Let's talk it out.\"It should be a shared choice,\" Sinha says. \"That person hears why their loved one actually wants to protect them, and this prompts a conversation and helps the person understand, 'While I'm worried about you getting Covid-19, I appreciate that you want to protect me from that.'\"Discuss why you want to visit and acknowledge the risk involved.Have you been staying home and limiting your exposures?Or have you had to work daily in environments that could expose them to the virus.If it's the second one, it's best to visit virtually.Follow the safest protocol.There's no way to ensure total safety. But there are steps we all can take to keep the risk as low as possible.Read over Sinha's recommendations, which he developed with the American Red Cross Scientific Advisory Council:Be well. Make sure you're not sick when you plan to visit, whether that means a runny nose, fever or stomach ache -- any form of illness. We won't let you visit if any of us are sick, either.Wear masks. Keep it on for the duration of your visit, if you can. If you're asymptomatic, masks help keep you from breathing out the virus. (And you can learn how to make your own.)Wash your hands. As soon as you walk in, wash your hands for 20 seconds with soap and water. As your family, we'll disinfect frequently touched surfaces before you arrive.Greet without touch. Try not to greet us with a kiss or hug, as hard as that may be to resist.Keep your distance. You know the drill: Keep at least six feet of distance. We know, it's weird.Sinha also recommends his older patients re-up their vaccinations, particularly against the flu and pneumonia.If you do come down with coronavirus, there's a higher chance you may also become infected with pneumonia or the flu at the same time. Multiple illnesses will stress out your immune system. Pace yourself when you're visiting. So, it's decided -- you're visiting. Now you may need to pick which family members get first dibs on you.When you visit multiple people, the possibility that you'll be exposed to the virus grows, Dr. William Schaffner told us. He's an infectious disease specialist at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.\"Start off with a few people, or just one at a time,\" Schaffner says. \"This is not the time to have a once-in-20-years family reunion.\"Here's another consideration that may sway your choice: Children younger than 5 may have trouble adhering to social distancing measures. If they (or you) can't resist bear hugs or slobbery cheek kisses, consider visiting families with older children, Sinha says. Let's meet outside.Schaffner suggests we choose the great outdoors as our reunion venue, like a park or garden where we can stay safely distant from others.Transmission is unlikely outside, as long as we're keeping 6 feet apart, thanks to constant air flow, Schaffner says. But it's best to wear a mask anyway to prevent asymptomatic transmission should we accidentally come close.One last thing: We, your doting relatives, love you dearly. These guidelines aren't ideal, and we've never had to do anything like this before. But if we take these measures now, we'll do our part to stop the spread of coronavirus. And when this pandemic is through, we can bring on the bear hugs again.Oh, and keep washing your hands.main pieces of advice to avoid the coronavirus\n",

      "While many Americans are sheltering at home to help “flatten the curve” and slow the spread of coronavirus disease (also called COVID-19), they might be tempted to buy or use questionable products that claim to help diagnose, treat, cure, and even prevent COVID-19.Because COVID-19 has never been seen in humans before, there are currently no vaccines to prevent or drugs to treat COVID-19 approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA is working with vaccine and drug manufacturers to develop new vaccines for and find drugs to treat COVID-19 as quickly as possible. Meanwhile, some people and companies are trying to profit from this pandemic by selling unproven and illegally marketed products that make false claims, such as being effective against the coronavirus.These fraudulent products that claim to cure, treat, or prevent COVID-19 haven’t been evaluated by the FDA for safety and effectiveness and might be dangerous to you and your family.The FDA is particularly concerned that these deceptive and misleading products might cause Americans to delay or stop appropriate medical treatment, leading to serious and life-threatening harm. It’s likely that the products do not do what they claim, and the ingredients in them could cause adverse effects and could interact with, and potentially interfere with, essential medications.The FDA has also seen unauthorized fraudulent test kits for COVID-19 being sold online. Currently, the only way to be tested for COVID-19 is to talk to your health care provider. The FDA has not authorized any test that is available to purchase for testing yourself at home for COVID-19. You will risk unknowingly spreading COVID-19 or not getting treated appropriately if you use an unauthorized test. The FDA knows that having a home test for COVID-19 would be very helpful and is actively working with test developers on this. But currently the FDA has not authorized any home test for COVID-19.There Are No Vaccines or Medicines for COVID-19, Yet. The FDA is working with medical product developers to rapidly advance the development and availability of vaccines and treatments for COVID-19. Although there are investigational COVID-19 vaccines and treatments being studied in clinical trials, these products are in the early stages of development. They haven’t yet been fully tested for safety or effectiveness, or received FDA approval.Fraudulent COVID-19 products can come in many varieties, including dietary supplements and other foods, as well as products claiming to be tests, drugs, medical devices, or vaccines. The FDA has been working with retailers to remove dozens of misleading products from store shelves and online. The agency will continue to monitor social media and online marketplaces promoting and selling fraudulent COVID-19 products.Recently, the FDA and the Federal Trade Commission issued warning letters to seven companies for selling fraudulent COVID-19 products. The products cited include teas, essential oils, tinctures, and colloidal silver (see product photosExternal Link Disclaimer on Flickr). The FDA is actively monitoring for any firms marketing products with fraudulent COVID-19 diagnostic, prevention and treatment claims. The FDA is exercising its authority to protect consumers from firms selling unauthorized products with false or misleading claims. The FDA may send warning letters, or pursue seizures or injunctions against people, products, or companies that violate the law. We are also increasing our enforcement at ports of entry to ensure that fraudulent products do not enter the country through our borders.In addition, the FDA is monitoring complaints of fake coronavirus treatments and tests. Consumers and health care professionals can help by reporting suspected fraud to the FDA’s Health Fraud Program or the Office of Criminal Investigations. How to Protect Yourself and Your Family From Coronavirus Fraud. The FDA advises consumers to be cautious of websites and stores selling products that claim to prevent, treat or cure COVID-19. There are no FDA-approved products to prevent COVID-19. Products marketed for veterinary use, or “for research use only,” or otherwise not for human consumption, have not been evaluated for safety and should never be used by humans. For example, the FDA is aware of people trying to prevent COVID-19 by taking a product called chloroquine phosphate, which is sold to treat parasites in aquarium fish. Products for veterinary use or for “research use only” may have adverse effects, including serious illness and death, when taken by people. Don’t take any form of chloroquine unless it has been prescribed for you by your health care provider and obtained from legitimate sources. Here are some tips to identify false or misleading claims. Be suspicious of products that claim to treat a wide range of diseases. Personal testimonials are no substitute for scientific evidence.\n",
      "Few diseases or conditions can be treated quickly, so be suspicious of any therapy claimed as a “quick fix.” If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.\n",
      "“Miracle cures,” which claim scientific breakthroughs or contain secret ingredients, are likely a hoax. Know that you can’t test yourself for coronavirus disease.\n",
      "If you have symptoms of COVID-19, follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s guidelines, and speak to your medical provider. Your health care provider will advise you about whether you should get tested and the process for being tested in your area. If you have a question about a treatment or test found online, talk to your health care provider or doctor. If you have a question about a medication, call your pharmacist or the FDA. The FDA’s Division of Drug Information (DDI) will answer almost any drug question. DDI pharmacists are available by email, druginfo@fda.hhs.gov, and by phone, 1-855-543-DRUG (3784) and 301-796-3400. The sale of fraudulent COVID-19 products is a threat to the public health. If you are concerned about the spread of COVID-19, talk to your health care provider and follow the advice of FDA’s federal partners about how to prevent the spread of this illness.Beware of Fraudulent Coronavirus Tests, Vaccines and Treatments\n",

      "A novel respiratory virus that originated in Wuhan, China, last December has spread to six continents. Hundreds of thousands have been infected, at least 20000 people have died and the spread of the coronavirus was called a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March.Much remains unknown about the virus, including how many people may have very mild or asymptomatic infections, and whether they can transmit the virus. The precise dimensions of the outbreak are hard to know.Here’s what scientists have learned so far about the virus and the outbreak.What is a coronavirus?Coronaviruses are named for the spikes that protrude from their surfaces, resembling a crown or the sun’s corona. They can infect both animals and people, and can cause illnesses of the respiratory tract.At least four types of coronaviruses cause very mild infections every year, like the common cold. Most people get infected with one or more of these viruses at some point in their lives.Another coronavirus that circulated in China in 2003 caused a more dangerous condition known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. The virus was contained after it had sickened 8098 people and killed 774.Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012, is also caused by a coronavirus.The new virus has been named SARS-CoV-2. The disease it causes is called Covid-19.How dangerous is it?It is hard to accurately assess the lethality of a new virus. It appears to be less often fatal than the coronaviruses that caused SARS or MERS, but significantly more so than the seasonal flu. The fatality rate was over 2 percent, in one study. But government scientists have estimated that the real figure could be below 1 percent, roughly the rate occurring in a severe flu season.About 5 percent of the patients who were hospitalized in China had critical illnesses.Children seem less likely to be infected with the new coronavirus, while middle-aged and older adults are disproportionately infected.Men are more likely to die from an infection compared to women, possibly because they produce weaker immune responses and have higher rates of tobacco consumption, Type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure than women, which may increase the risk of complications following an infection.“This is a pattern we’ve seen with many viral infections of the respiratory tract — men can have worse outcomes,” said Sabra Klein, a scientist who studies sex differences in viral infections and vaccination responses at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.How is the new coronavirus transmitted?Experts believe that an infected animal may have first transmitted the virus to humans at a market that sold live fish, animals and birds in Wuhan. The market was later shut down and disinfected, making it nearly impossible to investigate which animal may have been the exact origin.  \n",
      "Bats are considered a possible source, because they have evolved to coexist with many viruses, and they were found to be the starting point for SARS. It is also possible that bats transmitted the virus to an intermediate animal, such as pangolins, which are consumed as a delicacy in parts of China, and may have then passed on the virus to humans.The outbreak grew because of human-to-human transmission.People infected with the virus produce tiny respiratory droplets when they breathe, talk, cough or sneeze, allowing the virus to travel through the air.Most respiratory droplets fall to the ground within a few feet. People who are in close contact with those infected, particularly family members and health care workers, may catch the virus this way.Scientists don’t know how long the new coronavirus can live on surfaces, and preliminary research suggests that hot and humid environments may not slow down the pathogen’s spread. Warm weather does tend to inhibit influenza and milder coronaviruses.Infected people may be able to pass on the new coronavirus even if they have few obvious symptoms, a study in Germany has found. That’s “bad news,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an expert in infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.When people don’t know they are infected, “they’re up and about, going to work or the gym or to religious services, and breathing on or near other people,” he said. Still, a report by the World Health Organization suggests that asymptomatic cases are rare.What symptoms should I look out for?\n",
      "Symptoms of this infection include fever, cough and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. The illness causes lung lesions and pneumonia. But milder cases may resemble the flu or a bad cold, making detection difficult.Patients may exhibit other symptoms, too, such as gastrointestinal problems or diarrhea. Current estimates suggest that symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as long as 14 days after being exposed to the virus.If you have a fever or a cough and recently visited China, South Korea, Italy or another place with a known coronavirus outbreak, or spent time with someone who did, see your health care provider. Call first, so the office can prepare for your visit and take steps to protect other patients and staff from potential exposure.Is there a test for the virus? What is the treatment?There is a diagnostic test that can determine if you are infected. It was developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, based on genetic information about the virus provided by the Chinese authorities.In early February, the C.D.C. sent diagnostic test kits to 200 state laboratories, but some of the kits were flawed and recalled. Now other laboratories are making their own tests. Other countries are using test kits manufactured locally or sent out by the W.H.O.The C.D.C. announced that anyone who wanted to be tested could, if a doctor approves the request. Private companies, such as LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics, are also rushing to provide tests at various labs across the country, but the supply has yet to meet public demand. Many patients complain that they still cannot get tested.Once a coronavirus infection is confirmed, the treatment is mainly supportive,  making sure the patient is getting enough oxygen, managing his or her fever and using a ventilator to push air into the lungs if necessary, said Dr. Julie Vaishampayan, chairwoman of the public health committee at the Infectious Diseases Society of America.Patients with mild cases are told to rest and drink plenty of fluids “while the immune system does its job and heals itself,” she said. Most people with mild infections recover in about two weeks. More than half of those who have been infected globally have already  recovered.A number of drugs are currently being tested as potential treatments, including  an antiviral medication called remdesivir, which appears to be effective in animals and was used to treat the first American patient in Washington State. The National Institutes of Health is testing the drug on infected patient in a clinical trial in Nebraska. The drug’s maker, Gilead, has also begun trials at various sites in Asia.How long will it take to develop a vaccine?A coronavirus vaccine is still months away — and perhaps years. While new technology, advancements in genomics and improved global coordination have allowed researchers to act quickly, vaccine development remains an expensive and risky process.After the SARS outbreak in 2003, it took researchers about 20 months to get a vaccine ready for human trials. (The vaccine was never needed, because the disease was eventually contained.)By the time of the Zika outbreak in 2015, researchers had brought the vaccine development timeline down to six months.Now, they hope that work from past outbreaks will help cut the timeline further. Scientists at the National Institutes of Health and several companies are working on vaccine candidates.Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said a preliminary clinical trial might get off the ground in as little as three months. But researchers would still need to conduct extensive testing to prove a vaccine was safe and effective.How can I protect myself?\n",
      "The best thing you can do to avoid getting infected is to follow the same general guidelines that experts recommend during flu season, because the coronavirus spreads in much the same way. Wash your hands frequently throughout the day. Avoid touching your face, and maintain a distance — at least six feet — from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.The risk of infection with the new coronavirus in the United States “is way too low for the general public to start wearing a face mask,” said Dr. Peter Rabinowitz, co-director of the University of Washington MetaCenter for Pandemic Preparedness and Global Health Security.But, he added, “if you have symptoms of a respiratory illness, wearing a mask reduces the risk of infecting others.”Should I cancel my international travel plans?Many countries have also enacted travel restrictions and bans, closing their doors to people from countries with sustained transmission of the virus. Governments around the world have been screening incoming passengers for signs of illness.Is it too late to contain the virus?W.H.O. officials have credited lockdown measures China imposed in late January for averting the spread of more cases from Wuhan. China sealed off cities, shut down businesses and schools, and ordered residents to remain in their homes. Officials use cellphone data to track and intercept those who have been to Hubei Province.In recent weeks, government workers have gone door-to-door to round up people who are infected, placing them in stadiums and other buildings that have been converted to makeshift hospitals. Now, official reports suggest that new cases in China are waning.But there is growing fear that containment may no longer be possible.Clarence Tam, an assistant professor of infectious diseases at the School of Public Health at the National University of Singapore, said the surge of cases in multiple countries was “concerning because we know the transmissions are spreading at a fast rate.”“We’ve learned some things of this new virus for the past couple of weeks that make it seem unlikely that containment will be a strategy that will completely stop this virus,” he added.There is benefit to delaying its spread as long as possible. Containing the virus may buy health officials more time to stock hospitals with test kits and respirators, and for local governments, companies and schools to enact strategies — telecommuting and online classes, for instance — that may reduce the spread.But the ability of nations to prepare for the arrival of coronavirus cases will depend largely on the strength of their health systems, capacity to conduct tests and effectiveness in communicating updates to the public.“We have been dealing with flu for decades, and even now it seems some countries don’t even have a policy for influenza preparedness,” said Leo Poon, head of the University of Hong Kong’s public health laboratory sciences division. “Not to mention something which is new to them. That’s a problem.”The Coronavirus: What Scientists Have Learned So Far\n",

      "Viral online posts claiming 5G is causing coronavirus are absolutely wrong. Conspiracy theorists are taking them seriously, however, and some are turning violent. Here's why their arguments are nonsense.The false, superstitious belief that 5G cellular networks are somehow causing a global health crisis has found a new conspiracy theory: the idea that the global coronavirus pandemic is caused by 5G. It is not.Since I originally wrote this, 5G conspiracy theories have turned violent. Anti-5G conspiracy theories have fueled 5G tower arson attacks. According to The Guardian, they're driven largely by viral Facebook posts, often from groups mixing in anti-Semitic slurs and conspiracy theories about 9/11. The New York Times suggests a Russian-backed propaganda campaign is in part to blame.\n",
      "A petition on Change.org claiming that \"60 megahertz waves\" would \"suck the oxygen out of our lungs\" (it won't) got more than 114000 signatures before it was deleted. In the US, the conspiracy theories were prominently promoted by Keri Hilson, an R&B singer who for some reason has 4.2 million Twitter followers and 2.3 million Instagram followers. She has since deleted the tweet (\"Management has asked me to delete vid/articles,\" she wrote in a follow-up tweet) but apparently got it from someone with 839000 Instagram followers going by \"chakabars,\" from a completely random chiropractor named Gloriane Giovanelli, and from the Wikipedia quick-fact snippet appearing on a search for \"Who invented 5G?'\"Hilson's most striking source is a completely insane video, which she posted to her Instagram, where a man with his name tag turned backwards claims that the 1918 flu pandemic was caused by the invention of radio, some undescribed pandemic during World War II was caused by \"Radar fields,\" and a 1968 flu in Hong Kong was caused by \"satellites emitting radioactive frequencies.\"\"In the last six months, with the electrification of the Earth … it's called 5G,\" the unnamed man says, going on to spout more utter word salad, including \"the first completely blanketed 5G city in the world was … Wuhan, China.\"Hilson is not the only celeb to spread 5G coronavirus nonsense on social media. As the Times notes, John Cusack and Woody Harrelson have done the same.The Truth About 5G.5G isn't a new, higher frequency. It's just an encoding standard, which can work on many kinds of airwaves. In the UK and China, 5G operates on a band that's sandwiched between existing 4G networks and 5GHz Wi-Fi. That band is extremely similar to current LTE bands in behavior, and it is lower-frequency than the band used for high-speed Wi-Fi since 2009.Most of the 5G out there—including the 5G used in the UK—is just a slightly different way of encoding data on airwaves that are no higher-frequency than those used by Wi-Fi, and no lower-frequency than those used by televisions. Here in the US, most of the \"5G\" you see is just a slightly different form of encoding on airwaves that have been used for nearly 100 years. T-Mobile's low-band 5G is on old UHF TV channels. UHF TV did not cause coronavirus. AT&T's low-band 5G is on cellular frequencies used since 1983, and it is no more powerful. Sprint's 5G is on 4G frequencies that have been used since 2007.Yes, some new, higher frequencies—called millimeter-wave (mmWave)—are being used in the US (not the UK), but they have almost no coverage right now, much as Verizon's marketing would like you to think otherwise. Even though you probably have never encountered it, because it has almost no coverage, mmWave 5G has been certified as safe by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection. The technology has been studied for several years now, with the only negative effects detected being a slight heating effect at power levels far above what the FCC permits any transmitter to operate at. Citywide 5G was also available in the US and the UK before it was available in China. While China did indeed launch 5G in 50 cities on Nov. 1, UK carrier EE launched 5G last May, and Sprint launched broad-coverage 5G in nine US cities last summer (which we covered.) The US and UK have been \"blanketed\" with 5G for months longer than China has.COVID-19 is spreading in places that do not have 5G. Iran, a major hotspot, does not have 5G. Malaysia, another hotspot, does not have 5G. And so on. There is no correlation between increased spread and the presence of 5G. Italy has 5G and the virus went wild; Iran does not, and the virus went wild.\n",
      "Debunking That Dumb UK Petition. The specific Change.org argument in the UK seems to be related to a recent news story about the 60GHz band (not MHz) being approved late last year for unlicensed 5G use in Europe. But that band was approved for, and has been used for, unlicensed networking technologies since 2009. The only new move was to add one encoding standard to the list of existing standards available at 60GHz.No 5G network is currently using 60GHz or has plans to do so in the near future. But 60GHz networks have also existed for quite some time with no damage to anyone. The \"Soli\" feature in the Google Pixel 4 uses 60GHz. The frequency is the basis of the WiGig file-transfer technology, which has appeared in some laptops and phones since 2016. And 60GHz has been used as a metro-area internet backhaul transmission frequency for a decade now in places like Courtenay, BC. If there was an inherent problem with 60GHz, it would have shown up in one of those applications, but it hasn't.Stay safe, folks. Stay inside. Don't listen to craziness.No, 5G Is Not Causing Coronavirus (or Anything Else)\n",

      "As China attempts to contain the spread of a new coronavirus that has left more than 100 people dead, rumors and disinformation have spread amid the scramble for answers.Some of the speculation has centered on a virology institute in Wuhan, the city where the outbreak began. One fringe theory holds that the disaster could be the accidental result of biological weapons research.But in conversations with The Washington Post, experts rejected the idea that the virus could be man-made.“Based on the virus genome and properties there is no indication whatsoever that it was an engineered virus,” said Richard Ebright, a professor of chemical biology at Rutgers University.Tim Trevan, a biological safety expert based in Maryland, said most countries had largely abandoned their bioweapons research after years of work proved fruitless.“The vast majority of new, nasty diseases ... come from nature,” he said.The British newspaper Daily Mail was among the first to suggest the possibility of a link between the newly spreading virus and the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory, reporting last week that the lab, which opened in 2014 and is part of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, had been the subject of safety concerns in the past.A separate article published by the Washington Times, a conservative newspaper in Washington, took the theories a step further, suggesting in a headline that the “Coronavirus may have originated in lab linked to China’s biowarfare program” and pointing to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.The article cited research by Dany Shoham, a former Israeli military intelligence officer, who told The Post he did not want to comment further.Despite little public evidence, the theory has spread widely on social media, to conspiracy theory websites and in some international news outlets.The Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory is a “Cellular Level Biosafety Level 4” facility, which means it has a high level of operational security and is authorized to work on dangerous pathogens, including Ebola.Those entering the level 4 lab use airlocks and protective suits. Waste, and even air, is heavily filtered and cleaned before leaving the facility.Milton Leitenberg, an expert on chemical weapons at the University of Maryland, said he and other analysts around the world had discussed the possibility that weapons development at the Wuhan lab could have led to the coronavirus outbreak in a private email chain but that no one had found convincing evidence to support the theory.“Of course, if they are doing bioweaponry, it is covert,” Leitenberg said in a phone call, but added it was unlikely the Chinese government would use such a facility for production or even research and development of bioweapons.The Wuhan lab is well-known and it is relatively open compared with other Chinese institutes: It has strong ties to the Galveston National Laboratory at the University of Texas Medical Branch and was developed with the aid of French engineers.“Wuhan Institute of Virology is a world-class research institution that does world-class research in virology and immunology,” Ebright said, noting that one specialty of the facility was researching coronaviruses transmitted by bats.Trevan, who was quoted in a 2017 article in Nature that warned of possible risks at the Wuhan facility that was cited by the Daily Mail, said in a phone call to The Post that he was concerned at the time about how to “manage risk in these complex systems when you cannot predict all the ways in which the system could fail.”A former British diplomat and political adviser to the United Nations, he said he had not followed affairs at the facility closely since 2017 and was not aware of any specific problems there, but that he doubted the coronavirus outbreak could have come from a weapons program.An annual State Department report released last year said China had engaged “in biological activities with potential dual-use applications.”Elsa Kania, a fellow at the Center for a New American Security, said that while Chinese officials had expressed public interest in the potential weaponization of biotechnology, a coronavirus would not be a useful weapon.“Hypothetically, a bioweapon would be designed to be highly targeted in its effects, whereas since its outbreak the coronavirus is already on track to become widespread in China and worldwide,” she said.Vipin Narang, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, wrote in a message on Twitter that a good bioweapon “in theory has high lethality but low, not [high], communicability” and that spreading such ideas would be “incredibly irresponsible.”After the 2014 Ebola outbreak, fringe news outlets suggested spuriously that the U.S. Department of Defense had manufactured the virus. In the Soviet Union, military labs did look into whether the virus could be used as a weapon but ultimately abandoned those hopes.The speculation may be linked to uncertainty over where the ongoing novel coronavirus outbreak originated. Some scientists initially suspected a seafood market in Wuhan may have been the starting point, but a study by Chinese researchers and published in the Lancet on Friday questioned that analysis.Late Tuesday, Hu Xijin, editor of the nationalistic Global Times newspaper, wrote that a conspiracy theory had emerged in China that the United States was responsible for the outbreak. “Their logic: Why always China?” Hu wrote on Twitter. “But most Chinese don’t believe it.”Experts debunk fringe theory linking China’s coronavirus to weapons research\n",

      "The National Institutes of Health has given millions of dollars to scientists studying coronaviruses. That funding didn't cause the COVID-19 pandemic.Right-wing media and conspiracy theorists have seized on a series of grants awarded over the course of six years to study coronaviruses to undermine Dr. Anthony Fauci, the immunologist who’s been at the helm of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984. The narrative moved to the spotlight at the White House when, during a press conference on April 17, a reporter with Newsmax asked President Donald Trump about the grants, totaling $3.7 million since 2014.The Daily Mail, a British tabloid known for publishing unreliable stories, first reported the $3.7 million figure on April 11. The paper wrote a story on the funding, parts of which went to the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China. Although the article stated that there’s no evidence the novel coronavirus leaked from the lab, it implied a correlation between the grants and the pandemic: \"The revelation that the Wuhan Institute was experimenting on bats from the area already known to be the source of COVID-19 — and doing so with American money — has sparked further fears that the lab, and not the market, is the original outbreak source.\"Those questions have had real effects. Politico reported on April 27 that the National Institutes of Health would be revoking grants given to New York–based nonprofit organization EcoHealth Alliance in 2019, including funds for 2020 that the nonprofit now has to return.But in reality, the grants appear to have nothing to do with the coronavirus pandemic. In fact, they were awarded after a different kind of coronavirus — SARS — spread across the world in 2003. The NIH also didn’t give the funds directly to the Wuhan Institute, instead awarding them to EcoHealth Alliance, which invests in health research globally. The money helped support research that led to 20 research papers on coronaviruses published over the six years, according to the NIH. It’s not clear whether Fauci was personally involved in the grants in any way.Aside from the Wuhan Institute, those funds also went to research facilities in Shanghai, Beijing, and Singapore. The grants were meant to “support research that aims to understand what factors allow coronaviruses, including close relatives to SARS, to evolve and jump into the human population and cause disease (called a spillover event),” an NIH spokesperson told BuzzFeed News.“Most emerging human viruses come from wildlife, and these represent a significant threat to public health and biosecurity in the US and globally, as demonstrated by the SARS epidemic of 2002–03, and the current COVID-19 pandemic,” the spokesperson said. “The project includes studying viral diversity in animal (bats) reservoirs, surveying people that live in high-risk communities for evidence of bat-coronavirus infection, and conducting laboratory experiments to analyze and predict which newly discovered viruses pose the greatest threat to human health.”The grant also wasn’t the first awarded to EcoHealth Alliance. The NIH has been funding infectious disease research projects through the nonprofit since 2005.\n",
      "But the Daily Mail failed to note that context, as did the Newsmax reporter, who on April 17 asked Trump: \"There was also another report [saying] that the NIH under the Obama administration in 2015 gave that lab $3.7 million in a grant. Why would the US give a grant like that to China?”Newsmax reporter Emerald Robinson did not return a request for comment.For Joan Donovan, the director of the Technology and Social Change Project at Harvard's Shorenstein Center, the attacks and conspiracies are part of a larger narrative undermining Fauci and his work. “If you don’t trust the scientist, you don’t trust the science,” Donovan said.And the right-wing media and conspiratorial YouTube channels have used the grants to stoke that distrust.On April 26, Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani called for an investigation of the grant on a New York morning radio show. Falsely and without evidence, the former mayor of New York implied the virus was created as a biological weapon, blaming Fauci and the administration of President Barack Obama.“China for the last 10 to 12 years has been carrying on these experiments, including in this Wuhan laboratory, with animals, and actually making this virus more dangerous,” Giuliani said on the show. “You could say that’s for scientific purposes, or you could say that’s for the purpose of weaponizing them.”“'Paid for the Damn Virus That’s Killing Us': Giuliani Rips Fauci Over Grants to Wuhan Laboratory,” said a Washington Examiner headline on April 26, gathering over 150000 Facebook likes, shares, and comments.“Anthony Fauci Should Explain '$3.7 Million to the Wuhan Laboratory'” read a headline in the Washington Times on April 27, which received over 165000 Facebook likes, shares, and comments.Rep. Matt Gaetz and Newsweek may have also perpetuated the falsely shaded narrative, but the most popular piece of content about the grants came from the Next News Network, a YouTube channel known for circulating baseless claims, including a fabricated story about President Bill Clinton sexually assaulting a teenager. Hosted by commentator and conspiracy theorist Gary Franchi, the channel has over a million subscribers and surpassed a billion views in December, according to Forbes.On April 19, the Next News Network posted a video about the grants, which has received over 2.3 million views. In it, osteopath Rashid Buttar drew a direct line between the grant, Fauci, and the pandemic. According to YouTube, the video did not violate the social media company's policies.“Is Fauci directly responsible for this pandemic?” Franchi asked Buttar in the clip.“I’m going to say this: I’ve seen some petitions going around.\" Buttar responded. “I think he’s a criminal. He’s going against the law. He’s going against the government.”Franchi told BuzzFeed News he was asking Buttar \"to clarify his belief that Dr. Fauci’s work with coronaviruses has led to the pandemic.”He added: “The video as a whole revolves around President Trump responding to a reporter that he is investigating the widely reported 3.7 million dollars sent to the Wuhan Lab in 2015 by the NIH to continue coronavirus research after a moratorium was placed on such research in the United States and Dr. Fauci’s involvement with the funding of that research.”In addition to spreading conspiracy theories about the pandemic, Buttar has a history of action taken against him by medical authorities. In 2010, the North Carolina medical board reprimanded him for, among other complaints, three cancer patients who sought treatment from him and paid for treatment that had “no known value for the treatment of cancer.”“Buttar has spent years selling skin drops at $150 a bottle as a treatment for diseases ranging from autism to cancer,” WCNC reported at the time.In 2013, the FDA sent Buttar a warning letter for promoting and distributing unapproved medical products on his websites and Buttar did not respond to a request for comment on his statements about Dr. Fauci.\"The medical board and FDA have a responsibility to make sure doctors don't push too close to the edge,\" he said in an emailed statement to BuzzFeed News. \"The regulatory bodies serve an important function and are needed to safeguard the public.\"Past Coronavirus Research Grants Are Being Used To Smear Anthony Fauci\n",

      "\n",
      "Now let's back up a bit. Why would anyone think that vitamin C might be effective in treating this terrible virus? Vitamin C is an essential nutrient, and we all need it, but most people get plenty of vitamin C in their normal diet. As I've written before, taking vitamin C supplements is unnecessary but probably harmless, although megadoses carry the risk of kidney stones.The modern craze with vitamin C started with Linus Pauling, a brilliant chemist and a Nobel Prize winner. Late in his career, he wrote a book promoting vitamin C as a miracle cure for many illnesses, including the common cold (which is caused by a virus). He had very little good evidence for this belief, but his promotion of vitamin C led to hundreds of studies testing his hypothesis. The bottom line: vitamin C doesn't work at preventing or curing the common cold. (See Paul Offit's book if you want more details on this and many other \"miracle\" cures.)\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, someone might object: haven't some of those vitamin C studies (as in this review paper) shown a benefit against the common cold? Well yes, but when you run hundreds of studies of a treatment that doesn't work, this is what happens: negative studies are hard to get published, but positive studies are easier. Run enough studies, and a few of them, merely by chance, will show a small positive effect. That's what we've seen with vitamin C.Today, though, everyone is looking for a cure for COVID-19, and not surprisingly, many people (even some doctors) are claiming vitamin C is the answer. I've seen Twitter users explain, very confidently, that you just need to take 12000 mg of vitamin C and you'll get better. This website comes right out and states that high-dose vitamin C will cure coronavirus, based on a widely-shared video from a doctor in China. (I won't provide the link because it has already done enough damage.)\n",
      "\n",
      "It's almost impossible to disprove a claim that a treatment works. For example, I could claim that ginger snap cookies help to prevent coronavirus infection. That's right! Ginger snaps, made with real ginger, which seems to have magical curative properties. If you object, I could demand that you prove me wrong–but the onus is on me, as the one making the claim, to first provide some genuine evidence. We haven't seen anything like that for vitamin C.\n",
      "\n",
      "We need well-controlled experiments to know with any confidence that a treatment works. Some doctors at Wuhan University have started a trial of vitamin C to see if it has any benefits for COVID-19, but results won't be available for many months. I'm skeptical, but at least they're approaching the question the right way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dozens of studies of new treatments for COVID-19 are being launched right now, with remarkable speed due to the urgency of the pandemic.The WHO has just launched trials of the 4 most promising existing drugs (which don't include vitamin C, I should add). To obtain a believable, positive result, we need to see evidence that a carefully administered treatment provides a significant benefit over what we're doing now–which is little more than supportive care, unfortunately.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, we'll have to wait and hope that one of the plausible efforts currently under way will yield an effective treatment. We've been down this road too many times with vitamin C, though, and the chances that it will have any effect are, based on past experience, close to zero.No, Megadoses Of Vitamin C Will Not Cure Coronavirus\n",

      "First of all, experts say there has been no study connecting the flu shot with an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19.The central study cited by the Children’s Health Defense is a 2019 Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch study that probed the theory that “influenza vaccination may increase the risk of other respiratory viruses” — a concept known as “virus interference.”Edward Belongia, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the Marshfield Clinic Research Institute, told us that the theory rests on the idea that “if you get a flu infection, for example, maybe for some period of time your immune response to that flu infection reduces your risk of getting infected by some other virus.”\n",
      "Belongia said virus interference has been the subject of speculation and some studies with mixed results, but there is ultimately little data to support it. A 2013 study he worked on, cited in the AFHSB study, found that “influenza vaccination was not associated with detection of noninfluenza respiratory viruses.”In fact, the AFHSB study concluded that its “overall results … showed little to no evidence supporting the association of virus interference and influenza vaccination.”The erroneous claim that the study shows a heightened risk for COVID-19 for those vaccinated for the flu hinges on the study’s suggestion that vaccinated individuals appeared more likely to get “coronavirus.”But the study looked at four types of seasonal coronaviruses that cause common colds, not SARS-CoV-2.What’s more, Belongia said, the results in the study that indicate a flu-vaccinated person has an increased likelihood of testing positive for a seasonal coronavirus do not appear to be adjusted for age groups or seasons. Those factors could affect someone’s chances of getting a specific virus, regardless of whether or not they’ve been vaccinated for the flu.Different viruses affect different age groups and circulate at different times, he said. “It can be easily explained just by random variation and the fact that they didn’t adjust for confounding variables.”The Military Health System, of which the AFHSB is a part, noted in a statement to FactCheck.org that the study used data collected two years before the emergence of COVID-19 and looked at the seasonal coronaviruses — “impacting children and adults with no serious complications” — which “do not have the potential for epidemic or pandemic spread.”“The study does not show or suggest that influenza vaccination predisposes in any way, the potential for infection with the more severe forms of coronavirus, such as COVID-19,” the MHS said.Furthermore, the statement said, “it’s also important to note the study found evidence of significant protection by influenza vaccination against not only multiple forms of the flu, but other, very serious non-influenza viruses, such as parainfluenza, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), and non-influenza virus coinfections. It remains essential for people to obtain the seasonal flu shot each year as it becomes available.”There have been some results suggestive of virus interference, which the Children’s Health Defense cites in its post. But none of the studies referenced assessed risks of the flu shot when it comes to COVID-19.For example, Sharon Rikin, an assistant professor of medicine at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center, said in an email that a 2018 study she worked on “showed an association with flu vaccination and a slightly higher risk of non-flu acute respiratory infections (such as the common cold) in children. However, this association was not seen in adults.”“In medicine, we are always weighing the risks and benefits of treatments. In this case, we know that the flu vaccine is safe and effective to reduce illness and death among children and adults every year,” Rikin added. “We have not studied the association between flu vaccination and risk of COVID-19. Fortunately, COVID-19 is typically not causing significant illness in children. However, preventing illness and death from flu still remains extremely important for children.”Rikin said “just because we found an association between flu vaccines and acute respiratory infections does not mean that the flu vaccine actually caused there to be a higher risk of infections.” She said the group struggled to find a “biologically plausible explanation” and that while “there is a small body of literature that hypothesizes that the phenomenon of shifts in viral prevalence could be caused by viral interference,” there is not “strong empirical evidence of this occurring.”\n",
      "Belongia told us that, ultimately, the evidence of virus interference through such studies “is weak and inconclusive.”“Overall, we do not see evidence of virus interference that is sufficient to raise concerns about flu vaccination and COVID-19 risk,” he said. “Serious COVID-19 disease occurs primarily in adults, and we do not have evidence of flu vaccine causing virus interference in adult age groups.”He said that getting the flu shot, if anything, is especially important because of potential problems posed by the combination of the flu and COVID-19, both for the health care system and individuals.Likewise, Richard Ellison, a professor of medicine at the University of Massachusetts Medical School and hospital epidemiologist at UMass Memorial Medical Center, told us in an email that “getting the flu itself carries very significant morbidity and potentially mortality — so we don’t want someone to get the flu in the first place.”“In addition, while having the flu may boost the immune system, it can significantly weaken someone’s overall health status, and make them more susceptible to complications should they be unfortunate enough to have both influenza and COVID-19 in the same year.”No Evidence That Flu Shot Increases Risk of COVID-19\n",

      "Numerous conspiracy theories shared on and off social media claim that 5G mobile networks are the cause of the novel coronavirus pandemic. This is false; experts told AFP that 5G is based on radio frequency and that this does not create viruses. In one of the most widespread claims, popular American singer Keri Hilson asserted that coronavirus is caused by fifth-generation wireless technology, known as 5G. In a series of now-deleted tweets on March 16, 2020 (archived here), Hilson claimed  COVID-19 was not as widespread in Africa because of the absence of 5G. “People have been trying to warn us about 5G for YEARS. Petitions, organizations, studies…what we’re going through is the effects of radiation. 5G launched in CHINA. Nov 1, 2019. People dropped dead,” she wrote. “Turn off 5G by disabling LTE!!! Why do you think the virus is not happening in Africa like that? Not a 5G region. There may be a few bases there, but not as prevalent as other countries. It has nothing to do with melanin.” Hilson shared a viral YouTube video in which controversial American doctor Thomas Cowan, who remains on probation imposed by the Medical Board of California, argued that the novel coronavirus was created by 5G networks. In his video, Cowan claimed that Wuhan, the city where the novel coronavirus outbreak began, was the first city wholly covered by 5G in the world. Cowan and others who believe his theory claim that China launched 5G in October 2019 — two months before the outbreak started. Some of these claims about 5G causing novel coronavirus have been made in Facebook posts shared hundreds of times, like here and here. 5G coverage Experts differ on which country leads in the commercial use of 5G, but agree that the top nations are China, South Korea (the first to launch in 2019), the United Kingdom and the United States. In late October 2019, China rolled out the commercial use of 5G in 50 cities. Not only did the novel coronavirus not get its start in pioneering South Korea, but the virus has gained a foothold in many countries (for example, Malaysia, Iran, France, Singapore and Nigeria) without 5G networks. 5G does not cause viruses While there have been health concerns regarding the use of 5G networks — and mobile networks in general — owing to radiation, this has nothing to do with the outbreak of viruses, experts told AFP. Speaking to Keri Hilson’s claims, Yusuf Sambo, a researcher at the University of Glasgow who is testing 5G in Scotland, said: “I think she’s an amazing singer, but I am not sure she knows what she’s talking about. Yes, there are fears about the health implications of 5G but they have to do with cancer and not viral infections.” “One of her tweets actually advised people to ‘turn off 5G by disabling LTE’. She is literally saying ‘turn off 5G by disabling 4G’,” said Sambo. Fabien Heliot, a researcher who specialises in electromagnetic exposure in wireless communication at the University of Surrey, explained: “5G, like previous generations of cellular communication systems, is a RF-based (radiofrequency) technology that uses electromagnetic (EM) waveform to transmit information; EM-waveforms are themselves non-ionizing radiations.”  Heliot said the waveforms in 5G are designed and transmitted similarly to 4G. “The main and only difference so far is ... that 5G can transmit more data by using larger frequency bandwidth at higher carrier frequency, and directivity of antennas at the base station.” Being a living thing, a virus cannot be created by radiation, added Heliot. “Actually it is the other way round — there are guidelines put in place to ensure that radiation does not harm living things.” 5G and health. Heliot said that “the possible side-effects of 5G are the same as 4G, 3G, 2G, Wi-Fi; all these wireless communication technologies use EM waveform that radiates energy”. He said 5G radiations are not as severe as “CT scan or x-ray technologies” which are used in medical care. The World Health Organization's website states that “a large number of studies have been performed over the last two decades to assess whether mobile phones pose a potential health risk. To date, no adverse health effects have been established as being caused by mobile phone use”. Regarding 5G, the WHO states: “Health-related conclusions are drawn from studies performed across the entire radio spectrum but, so far, only a few studies have been carried out at the frequencies to be used by 5G. “Tissue heating is the main mechanism of interaction between radiofrequency fields and the human body. Radiofrequency exposure levels from current technologies result in negligible temperature rise in the human body. “As the frequency increases, there is less penetration into the body tissues and absorption of the energy becomes more confined to the surface of the body (skin and eye). Provided that the overall exposure remains below international guidelines, no consequences for public health are anticipated.”Some countries are remaining cautious: In late January, France's Agency for Health and Safety highlighted a need for more data before 5G could be rolled out in the country. Experts dismiss claims that 5G wireless technology created the novel coronavirus\n",

      "Scientists cast doubt on the Trump-backed theory that the coronavirus escaped from a Chinese lab. Why are the origins of the pandemic so controversial?\n",
      "How Covid-19 began has become increasingly contentious, with the US and other allies suggesting China has not been transparent about the origins of the outbreak.Donald Trump, the US president, has given credence to the idea that intelligence exists suggesting the virus may have escaped from a lab in Wuhan, although the US intelligence community has pointedly declined to back this up. The scientific community says there is no current evidence for this claim.This follows reports that the White House had been pressuring US intelligence community on the claim, recalling the Bush administration’s pressure to “stove pipe” the intelligence before the war in Iraq.What’s the problem with the Chinese version?A specific issue is that the official origin story doesn’t add up in terms of the initial epidemiology of the outbreak, not least the incidence of early cases with no apparent connection to the Wuhan seafood market, where Beijing says the outbreak began. If these people were not infected at the market, or via contacts who were infected at the market, critics ask, how do you explain these cases?Two laboratories in Wuhan studying bat coronaviruses have come under the spotlight. The Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) is a biosecurity level 4 facility – the highest for biocontainment – and the level 2 Wuhan Centre for Disease Control, which is located not far from the fish market, had collected bat coronavirus specimens.Several theories have been promoted. The first, and wildest, is that scientists at WIV were engaged in experiments with bat coronavirus, involving so-called gene splicing, and the virus then escaped and infected humans. A second version is that sloppy biosecurity among lab staff and in procedures, perhaps in the collection or disposal of animal specimens, released a wild virus.Is there any evidence the virus was engineered?The scientific consensus rejecting the virus being engineered is almost unanimous. In a letter to Nature in March, a team in California led by microbiology professor Kristian Andersen said “the genetic data irrefutably shows that [Covid-19] is not derived from any previously used virus backbone” – in other words spliced sections of another known virus.Far more likely, they suggested, was that the virus emerged naturally and became stronger through natural selection. “We propose two scenarios that can plausibly explain the origin of Sars-CoV-2: natural selection in an animal host before zoonotic [animal to human] transfer; and natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer.”Peter Ben Embarek, an expert at the World Health Organization in animal to human transmission of diseases, and other specialists also explained to the Guardian that if there had been any manipulation of the virus you would expect to see evidence in both the gene sequences and also distortion in the data of the family tree of mutations – a so-called “reticulation” effect.In a statement to the Guardian, James Le Duc, the head of the Galveston National Laboratory in the US, the biggest active biocontainment facility on a US academic campus, also poured cold water on the suggestion.“There is convincing evidence that the new virus was not the result of intentional genetic engineering and that it almost certainly originated from nature, given its high similarity to other known bat-associated coronaviruses,” he said.What about an accidental escape of a wild sample because of poor lab safety practices?The accidental release of a wild sample has been the focus of most attention, although the “evidence” offered is at best highly circumstantial.The Washington Post has reported concerns in 2018 over security and management weakness from US embassy officials who visited the WIV several times, although the paper also conceded there was no conclusive proof the lab was the source of the outbreak.Le Duc, however, paints a different picture of the WIV. “I have visited and toured the new BSL4 laboratory in Wuhan, prior to it starting operations in 2017- … It is of comparable quality and safety measures as any currently in operation in the US or Europe.”He also described encounters with Shi Zhengli, the Chinese virologist at the WIV who has led research into bat coronaviruses, and discovered the link between bats and the Sars virus that caused disease worldwide in 2003, describing her as “fully engaged, very open and transparent about her work, and eager to collaborate”.\n",
      "Maureen Miller, an epidemiologist who worked with Shi as part of a US-funded viral research programme, echoed Le Duc’s assessment. She said she believed the lab escape theory was an “absolute conspiracy theory” and referred to Shi as “brilliant”.Problems with the timeline and map of the spread of the virus. While the experts who spoke to the Guardian made clear that understanding of the origins of the virus remained provisional, they added that the current state of knowledge of the initial spread also created problems for the lab escape theory.When Peter Forster, a geneticist at Cambridge, compared sequences of the virus genome collected early in the Chines outbreak – and later globally – he identified three dominant strains.Early in the outbreak, two strains appear to have been in circulation at roughly at the same time – strain A and strain B – with a C variant later developing from strain B.But in a surprise finding, the version with the closest genetic similarity to bat coronavirus was not the one most prevalent early on in the central Chinese city of Wuhan but instead associated with a scattering of early cases in the southern Guangdong province.Between 24 December 2019 and 17 January 2020, Forster explains, just three out of 23 cases in Wuhan were type A, while the rest were type B. In patients in Guangdong province, however, five out of nine were found to have type A of the virus.“The very small numbers notwithstanding,” said Forster, “the early genome frequencies until 17 January do not favour Wuhan as an origin over other parts of China, for example five of nine Guangdong/Shenzhen patients who had A types.”In other words, it still remains far from certain that Wuhan was even necessarily where the virus first emerged.If there is no evidence of engineering and the origin is still so disputed, why are we still talking about the Wuhan labs theory?The pandemic has exacerbated existing geopolitical struggles, prompting a disinformation war that has drawn in the US, China, Russia and others.Journalists and scientists have been targeted by people with an apparent interest in pushing circumstantial evidence related to the virus’s origins, perhaps as part of this campaign and to distract from the fact that few governments have had a fault-free response.What does this mean now?The current state of knowledge about coronavirus and its origin suggest the most likely explanation remains the most prosaic. Like other coronaviruses before, it simply spread to humans via a natural event, the starting point for many in the scientific community including the World Health Organization.Further testing in China in the months ahead may eventually establish the source of the outbreak. But for now it is too early.Where did Covid-19 come from? What we know about its origins\n",

      "We have listened with concern to voices erroneously suggesting that herd immunity may “soon slow the spread” of COVID-19. For example, Rush Limbaugh recently claimed that “herd immunity has occurred in California.” As infectious disease epidemiologists, we wish to state clearly that herd immunity against COVID-19 will not be achieved at a population level in 2020, barring a public health catastrophe.Although more than 2.5 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported worldwide, studies suggest that (as of early April 2020) no more than 2-4%3–5 of any country’s population has been infected with SARS-CoV-2 (the coronavirus that causes COVID-19). Even in hotspots like New York City that have been hit hardest by the pandemic, initial studies suggest that perhaps 15-21%, of people have been exposed so far. In getting to that level of exposure, more than 17500 of the 8.4 million people in New York City (about 1 in every 500 New Yorkers) have died, with the overall death rate in the city suggesting deaths may be undercounted and mortality may be even higher.Some have entertained the idea of “controlled voluntary infection,” akin to the “chickenpox parties” of the 1980s. However, COVID-19 is 100 times more lethal than the chickenpox. For example, on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, the mortality rate among those infected with SARS-CoV-2 was 1%. Someone who goes to a “coronavirus party” to get infected would not only be substantially increasing their own chance of dying in the next month, they would also be putting their families and friends at risk. COVID-19 is now the leading cause of death in the United States, killing almost 2000 Americans every day. Chickenpox never killed more than 150 Americans in a year.To reach herd immunity for COVID-19, likely 70% or more of the population would need to be immune. Without a vaccine, over 200 million Americans would have to get infected before we reach this threshold. Put another way, even if the current pace of the COVID-19 pandemic continues in the United States – with over 25000 confirmed cases a day – it will be well into 2021 before we reach herd immunity. If current daily death rates continue, over half a million Americans would be dead from COVID-19 by that time.As we discuss when and how to phase in re-opening,10 it is important to understand how vulnerable we remain. Increased testing will help us better understand the scope of infection, but it is clear this pandemic is still only beginning to unfold.Early Herd Immunity against COVID-19: A Dangerous Misconception\n",

      "“I will tell you, more and more, we’re hearing the story [that the new coronavirus emerged from a Wuhan lab].” President Trump isn’t the only one hearing this tale. The political world, Internet theorists, intelligence analysts and global public health officials are abuzz with a big question: Is it possible that the new coronavirus — which causes covid-19 — leaked from a lab?For months, Chinese authorities have pointed to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan as the virus’s likely origin. A cluster of early cases had contact with the market. It sold a wide variety of wildlife that, officials hypothesized, was critical to the virus’s formation and spread. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which cause similar symptoms, were formed after a coronavirus from a bat transformed in another animal and then jumped to humans.The logic seems straightforward. But a more complete analysis of early cases suggests that locating the origin of the virus may not be so simple. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that of the first 425 patients, only 45 percent had connections to the market. A separate Jan. 24 analysis published in the Lancet found that three of the first four cases — including the first known case — did not have market links.Daniel R. Lucey, a pandemics expert at Georgetown University, put it simply: “In my opinion, the virus came into the market before it came out of the market.”That tinge of uncertainty was bolstered after Washington Post columnist Josh Rogin revealed two 2018 cables in which State Department officials warned of safety issues at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a laboratory studying bat coronaviruses. Renewed questions about the virus’s origin brought a rush of alternative theories. Some claimed the virus was a bioweapon. Others suggested it had been altered for a scientific experiment or was simply a viral sample that escaped from a lab.Let’s be clear: No scientist we spoke to thinks the new coronavirus was designed as a bioweapon. When asked, Milton Leitenberg, a biological weapons expert at the University of Maryland, responded with a flat “No.”Most experts say the new coronavirus was the product of a natural process. Still, the safety issues described in the 2018 cables, the Chinese government’s response and the proximity of the labs to the market have raised eyebrows.As college professors are fond of saying, the absence of evidence is not the same as the evidence of absence. The Fact Checker video team investigates.The Facts. The Labs. In Wuhan, at least two labs study coronaviruses that originate in bats — the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) and the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention (WHCDC). Both are close to the seafood market. The WIV is about eight miles away. The WHCDC is right around the corner.Despite the overlap in research, what the two labs actually do is quite different. The WIV is home to China’s first laboratory to receive the highest level of international bioresearch safety (known as BSL-4). In addition, it houses lower-level (BSL-3 and BSL-2) labs. The WHCDC is home only to a BSL-2 lab.“BSL-2 is what we normally think of when we think of a lab,” explained Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. It is a lab where “somebody is wearing a lab coat and gloves; they’re at a bench.” (BSL-4 is akin to what is seen in movies such as “Contagion.”She explained that the seemingly relaxed security is because coronaviruses found in bats “don’t infect human cells very well, if at all. So often they’re not considered major potential pathogens because they just don’t grow very well in other species besides bats.” If scientists were being particularly cautious, she explained, they might work in a BSL-3 lab.Researchers from both labs faced criticism in recent years that they have not followed appropriate safety protocols. A video published in December 2019 shows Tian Junhua, a prominent researcher based at the WHCDC, conducting field research on bats without appropriate protective equipment.Warnings from U.S. diplomats in 2018 appeared to refer to the BSL-4 lab at the WIV. They reported: “During interactions with scientists at the WIV laboratory, they noted the new lab has a serious shortage of appropriately trained technicians and investigators needed to safely operate this high-containment laboratory.”\n",
      "But Rasmussen cautioned against putting too much weight on these reports: “Without fail, every single BSL-4 lab in the U.S. gets some type of safety violation, some type of thing that they could do better.”A 2019 paper written by WIV researchers about China’s effort to add more high-level bioresearch labs warned: “The experience of laboratory biosafety personnel training is relatively lacking. … Insufficient training staff and training problems such as uneven standards require urgent improvement.” A separate 2019 paper by Yuan Zhiming, a chief scientist at Wuhan, described systemic deficiencies at high-security labs: “Maintenance cost is generally neglected; several high-level BSLs have insufficient operating funds for routine, yet vital processes.” Most laboratories “lack specialized biosafety managers and engineers,” he wrote.Months after the new coronavirus was discovered, the Global Times, a state-run newspaper, published an article outlining new government guidelines aimed at fixing “chronic management loopholes at virus labs.” The article noted that some labs have paid “insufficient attention to biological disposal.”Could a safety lapse have opened the door for the new coronavirus to escape one of these labs, just as SARS had? (To be clear, SARS escaped after it had been identified. The initial outbreak did not begin this way.) Accidents happen. Records reveal multiple accidents have led to the escape of dangerous pathogens and inadvertent infections at U.S. laboratories.While no comparable records exist in China, one of the world’s foremost experts on these viruses, Shi Zhengli, based at the WIV, thought it was possible. In March, Shi told the Scientific American that in the early days of the outbreak, even she wondered whether coronaviruses were to blame. “Could they have come from our lab?” After all, her lab had collected and sequenced tens of thousands of coronaviruses over the past decade. (She has since adamantly denied that the new coronavirus could have emerged from her lab. Her boss and the WIV issued similar denials.The Virus.Safety protocols aren’t a virus’s only barrier between a life in a test tube and one infecting millions. The virus would need to be able to infect humans (or another animal that can then infect humans), and that infection needs to be strong enough that it isn’t immediately beaten by the immune system, allowing it to spread among people.Most known bat coronaviruses cannot do either of these things. The novel coronavirus, however, can do both. That said, it is called “novel” for a reason: It had never before appeared in scientific research.Viruses — like people — have distinct genetic sequences that give scientists clues to their origin. Research published in the journal Nature on Feb. 3 found that this virus falls within a family of known coronaviruses that come from bats. It shares nearly 80 percent of the genome as the original SARS-CoV and 96 percent of the genome of a virus (RaTG13) that Shi’s team had previously sampled.While 96 percent may sound like a big overlap to nonscientists, the 4 percent difference is found in the part of the virus that binds to human cells. Without that adaptation, Lucey, the Georgetown professor, put it simply: “It’s interesting, but it’s not going to cause any outbreaks in people.”Moreover, the two viruses are generations apart. Edward Holmes, an evolutionary virologist from the University of Sydney who has written about the origin of the new virus, explained via email that the two viruses “shared a common ancestor that lived a long time ago. What this means is that [the new coronavirus] is NOT derived from RaTG13.” Holmes noted another virus that — like RaTG13 — was sampled 1000 miles from Wuhan in a cave in Yunnan is a closer relative to the new virus, but “not close enough to be the direct ancestor.” And critically, he said, this other virus, “is not from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, nor from anywhere else in Wuhan.”So how did this virus end up 1000 miles from the nearest known relative? There are any number of potential explanations. A wildlife trafficker might have brought an infected bat into the city. Another animal might have picked up the virus from bats years ago, allowing it to transform in just the right way to infect humans. There are thousands of bat viruses that scientists have not sampled and even more coronaviruses that circulate in other species, so there’s no guarantee it actually came from thousands of miles away.But even if that virus from Shi’s lab is not the source for the virus, her lab is full of bat coronavirus variants. That left us wondering: Could this virus have been the accidental product of an experiment gone awry? A 2015 paper cautioned against the “gain of function” experiments with which Shi’s team was involved. In this kind of experiment, the researchers mutate a virus strain to enhance a pathogen’s natural traits. Even though the most dangerous part of that experiment was not conducted at the WIV, the 2018 State Department cables referenced similar research by Shi and her team.In 2017, Shi and her team published a study revealing that they had found a coronavirus from a bat that could be transmitted directly to humans. After reviewing the study, Rasmussen said via email that just because these viruses could attach to human cells, it “does not show that they are particularly effective at doing so.” Binding is only one part of the process. “It is not the sole determinant of viral fitness (the ability of the virus to replicate robustly in a given host) or pathogenicity (the ability of the virus to cause disease).” Moreover, genomic analysis reveals that none of the virus samples used to conduct these experiments were or could have been transformed to be the new coronavirus that causes covid-19.That, however, is just one study. Shi’s lab published dozens of academic papers researching bat coronaviruses. The Washington Post reviewed academic studies that described “scores of encounters with animals that are known hosts to deadly viruses, including strains closely related to the pathogen behind the covid-19 outbreak.”“While the scientists wore gloves and masks and took other protective measures, U.S. experts who reviewed the experiments say the precautions would not necessarily protect the researchers from harmful exposures, in caves or in the lab,” The Post reported.This kind of research filled in critical gaps in scientific understanding of SARS-like coronaviruses. It also increased the risk of accidental exposure and lab accidents. But many scientists are still dubious.Kristian G. Andersen, an immunology and microbiology professor at Scripps Research, alongside Holmes and other researchers, stated firmly, “Our analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus.” Trevor Bedford, a researcher in computational biology and infectious diseases at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, was more specific. “You don’t see kind of large chunks of genomic material that are somehow inserted or absent,” he said. Rather, it is the opposite. “The differences are these small mutations, as you’d expect from nature.”(Shi did not return our emails. None of her current collaborators we spoke to could precisely speak to her current research.) Still, no scientist was willing to completely dismiss the idea — they only said that it was highly unlikely. After all, we neither know what either lab was specifically working on, nor do we have an archive of every animal in the lab and virus sequence in its freezer. Without identifying the earliest case and the evolution of the virus, everything is a hypothesis.Richard H. Ebright, a microbiologist and biosafety expert at Rutgers University, said: “The question whether the outbreak virus entered humans through an accidental infection of a lab worker is a question of historical fact, not a question of scientific fact. The question can be answered only through a forensic investigation, not through a scientific investigation.”The Chinese Response. The actions of Chinese officials have done little to quash suspicion of a lab leak. Before the government had even alerted the World Health Organization to the growing epidemic, scientists were told to destroy early samples of the virus, according to the Straits Times.Then, in an unusual move for the government, officials quickly pinned the outbreak on the market. But they have done little to provide supporting evidence for this theory. Officials reported that 33 of 585 environmental samples from the market contained the new coronavirus. Thirty-one of the positive samples were located in the area of the market known to sell wildlife. But where exactly these samples were taken is not clear. They could just as well have been taken from animal cages or a bathroom. Moreover, China has not divulged the results of any tests done on any animals that were recovered from the market before it was cleaned.\n",
      "Several doctors, journalists and researchers based in China appear to have suddenly gone quiet over this issue. The New York Times reported by mid-January — shortly after the sequence of the virus was made public — that “Chinese scientists cut off official communications” with their American counterparts.On Feb. 6, Botao Xiao, a molecular biomechanics researcher at South China University of Technology, published a paper arguing that “the killer coronavirus probably originated from a laboratory in Wuhan.” He pointed to the previous safety mishaps and the kind of research both labs undertake as evidence. After the paper gained international attention, Chinese authorities flatly denied that an accident happened. Xiao later withdrew the paper, explaining in a brief email to the Wall Street Journal on Feb. 26: “The speculation about the possible origins in the post was based on published papers and media, and was not supported by direct proofs.”The Chinese government’s actions have inhibited the scientific community’s ability to trace the origin of the virus and serve to only raise suspicions.\n",
      "“It just seems like such a remarkable coincidence that you have an outbreak of a coronavirus in theory from a bat in the same city where there is this high-level BSL-4 laboratory, where not only are there foreign concerns about its safety, but there are Chinese articles about the safety protocols not being sufficient. And obviously there’s no smoking gun,” said Emily de La Bruyère, a China expert with Horizon Advisory. “It’s all circumstantial, but it’s pretty remarkable.”\n",
      "In a statement via email, the Chinese Embassy in Washington told The Fact Checker: “The source of the virus is a serious and complex matter of science that must be studied by scientists and medical experts. Many scientists have already pointed out that COVID-19 has a natural origin.”But the U.S. government is not convinced. The intelligence community “will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan,” the director of national intelligence said in a statement on April 30.The Bottom Line. The balance of the scientific evidence strongly supports the conclusion that the new coronavirus emerged from nature — be it the Wuhan market or somewhere else. Too many unexpected coincidences would have had to take place for it to have escaped from a lab. But the Chinese government has not been willing or able to provide information that would clarify lingering questions about any possible role played by either Wuhan lab.That’s why intelligence agencies are still exploring that possibility, no matter how remote it may be. And even then, it’s unclear when or if we will ever know the origin story of this new virus that is causing death and economic turmoil around the globe.Was the new coronavirus accidentally released from a Wuhan lab?

      "The coronavirus is a very common kind of virus. It is causing an infection in the sinuses, nose or upper throat. It has first identified in the 1960s, but doctors do not know where they come from. This virus gets the name from the crown – like shape. In some cases, coronavirus can infect both animals and humans. Most types of coronaviruses spread the same way as other cold – causing viruses, through infected people sneezing and coughing; by touching the face or hands of the infected person; by touching things, such as doorknobs that infected people have touched.It is noticed that almost everyone gets a coronavirus infection at least once in their life, most likely as a child. It is noticed that the coronavirus is most common in fall and winter, but every single person can get it at any time. The most common symptoms of coronavirus include sore throat, coughing, runny nose and sometimes a fever. There are some cases when people do not know if they suffer from coronavirus, because the symptoms of this condition are very similar to others. Your doctor will make lab tests, including nose and throat cultures and blood work, to find out if your cold was caused by a coronavirus. If the coronavirus spreads to the lower respiratory tract, it can cause pneumonia, especially in older people, people with weak immune system and people with heart disease. You should know that there is no vaccine for coronavirus. You need to ask your doctor for permission about the below mentioned home remedies for coronavirus, so you will stay away from side effects and worsening of the symptoms.Home remedies for coronavirus infection prevention\n",
      "Wash your hands: It is very important to wash your hands regularly using soap and warm water. Also, you can wash your hands with an alcohol – based hand sanitizer. In this way, you will keep yourself clean and you will prevent any chance of getting the coronavirus from other people, because when people are infected it, they can cough or sneeze and transfer this virus to things that they touch. You need to wash your hands at least twenty seconds with disinfectant.void close contact with infected people: You can easily get the coronavirus if you are in contact with people who are infected. This is a reason why you should stay away from all infected people that you know. This will decrease your chances of getting infected with coronavirus. Lemon tea: The lemon tea is prepared using black tea or green tea and by adding the right amount of lemon juice to it. There are some studies in which are shown that the lemon tea can help in the treatment of flu. This home remedy can help to kill the infection from the passageway and it can remove the symptoms of the coronavirus infection, like sore throat.Do not smoke: It is known that smoke can worsen the symptoms of coronavirus, so you need to quit smoking and avoid going to smoking areas as much as possible. Basil: When you suffer from coronavirus, then it is very important to have a good detoxification. The attack of this virus is contagious. You need to dissolve one to two teaspoons of honey in one cup of basil tea. You need to drink this type of tea, because it can help you in the fight against coronavirus. Drink plenty of liquids: They can help you to stay hydrated and also, they can help to flush out toxins from your body. You can add water and herbal teas in your diet.Stay home and rest: It is recommended to people who suffer from coronavirus to stay at their homes and to take a good rest. In this way, then can prevent the virus from spreading to other people and you will give your body a full recovery that it needs a lot. Clean your home: It is very important to clean and disinfect objects and surfaces at your home, so in this way you will decrease your chances of getting the coronavirus, if some family member has. Cinnamon: There are some people who have reported improvements in their condition by using the cinnamon as their natural treatment for coronavirus, but you can talk with your doctor if it will be suitable for your condition. Yoga: You can do yoga when you are affected by the coronavirus. It will give you a relaxing feeling to your body and mind, so for some period you will not think about your infection. Steamy shower: It has been noticed that the steamy shower can help to ease the sore and scratchy throat. You can get the same effect if you use a humidifier. It is your choice to decide which will work better for you. The hot shower can help you to get a relief from the pain. Mint tea: There are some studies in which are noticed that the mint tea can help to stop the runny nose and it can help in easy breathing. It is a good home remedy for the fight against coronavirus. You need to add the mint tea in your diet, so you will see improvements in your condition.Gargle with warm water: This home remedy can give you a relief from the sore throat, so you can try it as your home remedy for coronavirus. Garlic: This natural cure has antibacterial and antiviral properties which can help in the fight against flu. You need to take a couple of fresh garlic cloves early in the morning, or you can take garlic supplements. Have your own towel: It is very important to have your own towel, because the person infected with coronavirus can spread it with the touch and you can easily get it. When you have a clean towel that is used just by you, then you will be sure that you are healthy. Use a tissue: When you are coughing and sneezing, you need to use a tissue, so in care you are infected with the coronavirus, you will not transmit it to other people. Menthol: This is component in many different formulations for relieving the cough and cold. You can add menthol in hot water and perform steam inhalation. It will give you a relief from the coughing and nasal congestion.Oregano oil: You can use oregano oil as your home remedy for the coronavirus, because it can help with the symptoms. It is important to remember not ingesting oregano oil and just to inhale it. Thoroughly cook: You need to thoroughly cook the meat and eggs, because the coronavirus can be spread through them, so in this way you will minimize your chances of getting it. Avoid unprotected contact with animals: It is known fact that coronavirus can affect animals too. This is a reason why you need to avoid having unprotected contact with farm animals or wild animals. Wear a mask: When someone suffers from respiratory infection, then he or she needs to wear a mask, because it can help to protect people around him or her from illnesses. When you wear a surgical mask, then it can somewhat protect you from an infection in a crowd if there is an outbreak. But in general, surgical masks are not closefitting enough to filter all the air you are breathing in. Throw used tissues: If you have used a tissue, then you need to throw it in the garbage, so you will reduce the risk of transferring the coronavirus to other people.Keep your hands away: It is very important not to touch your mouth, nose and eyes with your hands and fingers, especially if you have been in some area that you suspect there are infected people with coronavirus. You need to wash your hands with soap and warm water and then you can touch your face. Ginger tea: There are some studies in which are shown that the ginger tea can help to ease your headaches that are caused by the respiratory infections. You can use the ginger tea as your home remedy to relieve throats and loosen up congestion. Salad: You need to detoxify your body, so you will not allow the coronavirus to cause pneumonia in your body. You can remove the toxins from your body with the help of mixed vegetable salad. You need to use detoxifying foods, such as broccoli, cabbage, radishes and beetroot. You need to boil the mentioned ingredients and mix them gently. This is tasty and healthy home remedy which can help you in the fight against this virus. Lemon honey tea: This natural cure can help to soothe your airway passages and it can soften the rough coughs. This is a reason why you can use it as your home remedy for coronavirus. Do not doubt to add this tea in your diet as home remedy for this contagious virus.Top 10 best coronavirus infection prevention treatments\n",

      "Plan To Mitigate The Foreign Born Viral Coronavirus Invasion To America.There are simple and straightforward methods to blunt the coronavirus effects on America, given what we know about the spread of this virus, specific actions need to be implemented immediately. The facts are that the virus cannot spread without it getting access to a victim's mucus membranes via eyes, ears, and nose.Staff on airplanes and other public transport in high-risk situations of coming into contact with those who are infected, should be issued simple reusable masks and gloves made from an ion infused copper cotton material that is anti-viral on contact. The cotton should be infused with copper ions which kill viruses on contact, and thus wearing a copper infused cotton mask with or without an N95 or N99 filters are a superior protection choice.Prevention of mucus membrane exposure through contact with the hands or through inhalation along with use of tight fitting glasses will protect against cough droplets in the air, this is protection that can be manufactured inexpensively. Issuing colloidal silver in spray bottles to wash eyes will also greatly reduce risk of infection. A colloidal silver solution at 100 ppm is non irritating and universally viracidal as well as only costing a few cents per gallon to the manufacturer.  Technology now exists using nanotech vibrational tuning rods to detect the most infinitesimal amount of a discrete virus in solution. This technology is accurate to picogram scale. Originally developed in Germany, this technology has been commercialized and is being used for the detection of minute toxins in environmental materials. The same technology could be implemented for a very quick and inexpensive test for the virus, which would be much faster, cheaper and more accurate than the PCR technology currently being used. This would allow for instant screening of large numbers of people in rapid fashion at airports and other transportation ports as well as in the hospital and healthcare environments.In the past HEPA air filters were in common use because the airlines knew that the air in the cabins was recirculating previously breathed air and could increase the risk of spreading airborne infection. Unfortunately today they do not use these advanced filtration systems, as that raised the modest cost to the airlines per flight, and to save this small amount of money they discontinued use of these air filters. Additionally, the airlines insist on flying with the air vents closed in order to again save on the costs of a small amount of jet fuel being used in heating the air for the cockpit and the cabin. It would be a simple solution to install HEPA filters again in the air filtration systems. Airliners and cruise ships should also open the air vents to allow for less cross-contamination and rebreathing of stale air.A further solution would be the use of commercially available ozone generating machines between flights and airline cabins to detox and disinfect the cabin air and surfaces.  A blast of ozone is a superb disinfectant and could easily cleanse an airline cabin in 20 to 30 minutes; the same technology would be effective for cruise ships and trains as well.There are thousands of natural drugs, herbals, chemicals, plants and physical substances that have viral inhibiting and viral destructive capacity. A single lab could be used to test out these many products for the potential of a safe nontoxic answer to the coronavirus infection. A single lab with automated viral culture mass screening could quickly show which of the thousands of chemicals, drugs and other products of nature will stop this virus.Finally quarantine at home does not work and will not work as this virus has a long wait and see incubation period. It is also near impossible to keep people completely isolated. The answer is neighborhood isolation trailers that could be constructed quickly and easily, these could be delivered to a specific location where people in quarantine could be housed in near where they live. These isolation homes where the air would be filtered and the sewage would be kept in special isolated disinfected septic tanks, would allow for families to visit via large windows without risking contamination and delivery of food to their relatives via a two-way isolation door system. This would be a more humane and effective means of maintaining strict isolation, while maintaining people in their own community and not overwhelming hospitals with the burden of highly infectious diseased individuals.Patients on homecare with oxygen and BiPAP positive pressure airway therapy, would be on constant monitoring via telemedicine and Internet cameras, as well as medical telemetry to monitor their respiratory rate as well as their SA02 oxygen saturation, along with EKG, heart rate and their blood pressure. This monitoring could be accomplished via computer systems so that it was automated, again taking the strain and the stress away from the overburdened healthcare community.\n",
      "Should a patient’s condition begin faltering, a team of highly trained intensive care technicians in full hazmat isolation gear could be dispatched to the patient’s location in a matter of minutes, or just to ensure that a patient on homecare was receiving good care. This system may be even better than patient care in the hospital and would allow for patients who were deteriorating on homecare, to be rapidly transferred to hospital based respiratory intensive care units.Realize these technologies are off the shelf and are available at this very moment. The only question is the actual implementation of the system of remote controlled advanced high-tech medical care. This program could be in working status in a matter of days, and the cost savings would be immeasurable... the savings of lives.... would be even greater. All this with the added benefit of patients being able to isolate themselves at home in familiar environments, with the support of their already exposed family members.Utilizing an advanced use of CPAP, as well as remote teams of respiratory intensive care technicians, virtual reality tele-medicine, health monitoring telemetry, positive pressure oxygen therapy, and airway support could be an absolute game changer never seen before in the annals of healthcare.We owe the American people the best that we can provide.This worldwide pandemic is a manageable problem that need not lead to mass disruption or mass deaths. There is certainly a drug or many drugs that can inhibit this virus and prevent it’s furthered deadly outcome. The simplest of which are measures to protect your mucous membranes and to protect your hands from becoming germ transmitters. The American public deserves a better, more intelligent and more humane public health response from its Government. The above measures would give that to them at minimum cost and could be implemented in the matter of days, with no barriers stopping effective public health responses to this contagion impending threat to our nation.God bless America and God bless its leaders who take appropriate action to protect its citizens. History will record your actions accurately. INFO TO PROPER PARTIES TO ASSIST WITH CORONAVIRUS CONTAINMENT\n",

      "Time for an Ounce of Prevention.We all look forward to the Breath-Body-Mind workshops hosted by Serving Those Who Serve. However, this year, we are cancelling the March workshop to prevent exposing anyone to the coronavirus (COVID-19). In Japan, the healthcare researchers discovered that being in a room with a group of people dramatically increased the risk of transmission. Based on previous viral epidemics, we anticipate the next three months may be the period of the highest health risk. If we are unable to reschedule, then we will see you at the September workshop. We are looking into the possibility of providing Breath-Body-Mind workshops by webinar.Here are our recommendations for reducing the risk of COVID-19.Advice for Better Immune Defense and Prevention.The coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to spread and is likely to become a health concern everywhere within the coming months. There is no specific treatment in sight other than general recommendations for rest, fluids, nutrition, and symptomatic treatment of fever. However, there are measures that we can take to strengthen our immune defenses. This approach may reduce the likelihood of getting sick or, even if you acquire the virus, immune boosters can help to reduce the severity and shorten the length of illness.Because this is becoming a health crisis, we want to share with you a list of immune boosters that we rely on and that may be of help to you and your families. We only recommend the brands listed below because they have been studied and shown to be effective and of good quality. If you have any serious health conditions or allergies, please consult your personal physician and read the contents of each supplement before taking.  Also, follow recommendations for when to take these supplements. We do not receive any financial remuneration from supplement companies.Supplements to Boost Immune Defense. Kold-Care (Immune Kare) from Kare-n-Herbs at Karenherbs.com. For prevention Take 1 tab twice daily for prevention. If symptoms or exposure occur, take 1 tab 4 times daily. Respigard by Nature’s Nurse (Amazon).If symptoms or exposure occur, follow directions on the bottle for dosing. Immune Senescence Protection from Life Extension Foundation.Prevention: Take 2 daily right after eating breakfast (food prevents stomach upset). Bio-Strath available online from multiple companies. Follow directions on bottle.Sambucus by Nature’s Way.Prevention and if symptoms occur. Follow directions on bottle.If symptoms or exposure occur, follow directions on the bottle for dosing. Mushroom extracts: Maitake-D and Shiitake from the following companies: Mushroom Science, Mushroom Wisdom or Nature’s Way). Follow directions on bottle.Additional advice to optimize your body’s natural defense capacities.Get lots of rest. Go to bed earlier and readjust your activities as needed.Healthy diet is important with fresh fruits and vegetables every day.Drink lots of fluids to stay hydrated.For Prevention: Do Coherent Breathing 20 min a day to improve lung and immune function.  If you become ill and you are coughing, you will not be able to do this. Resume Coherent Breathing when you are able to do so without irritating your cough. At first you may need to start at 6 breaths per minute and work down to breaths per minute. Wash hands frequently. Use disinfectants to clean surfaces. Avoid touching your face because that is a common way the viruses are transferred from your fingers. Keep a small bottle of disinfectant with you to use after you have touched surfaces in public places that may have been contaminated.\n",
      "If you choose to wear a mask, be sure it is rated as N95 anti-viral.Avoid unnecessary social gatherings, especially in closed spaces. Do not share foods or platters. Minimize travel.We cannot predict the course of coronaviruses, but we can take common sense precautions. Contact your doctor if you have any symptoms such as fever or coughing, or if you think you have been exposed.We hope that you and your families stay healthy through this difficult time.CORONAVIRUS: An Once of Prevention Is Worth a Pound of Cure\n",

      "In view of the dire situation we currently face, with infections in dozens of countries and thousands of fatalities, here is a detailed description of the original Cold-Arrest Procedure with the suggested times and temperatures carefully optimized for coronavirus eradication:Turn hair dryer to the lowest setting and then cup fingers over the air intake to slow the air flow and increase its output temperature.With the other hand, use a wet cloth or a spray bottle filled with water to frequently moisten the facial surface around the nose and mouth. The flow of hot air causes the water to evaporate, keeping the face and nose cool while allowing the heat to penetrating deeply into the nose and sinuses. Take slow, deep breaths through the nose, with mouth closed, for 5 minutes. To minimize any discomfort, turn the blow dryer aside in between breaths so that warm air is directed toward the face and nose only while inhaling. If the air feels warm, but not hot, try a higher heat setting. The goal is to raise the inside of the nose and sinuses to the coronavirus kill temperature of at least of 56° C (133° F) during the entire treatment period. So, use the highest temperature you can safely tolerate.Pause between heat applications for about one hour. This allows time for the natural movement of the mucus layer within the sinuses to reposition any potentially shielded virus to a more exposed location where it can be heated and destroyed.After the cooling period, begin another 5-minute hot air treatment. If no symptoms have appeared, two heating cycles per day should be sufficient for prevention. However, if symptoms have already developed, three to five of these alternating heating/cooling cycles per day are recommended, until symptoms disappear.If widely used as an added prevention step, along with wearing a mask and handwashing, this Cold-Arrest hyperthermia therapy has the potential of helping to halt any further spread of Covid-19. It also offers an important psychological benefit for those who are currently in isolation, quarantine, or lockdown for a prolonged viral incubation period. Instead of just waiting, helplessly, to see if symptoms develop, patients can take a proactive role by exterminating any virus that may be present.breathing in hot air from a hair dryer or in a sauna can prevent or cure COVID-19.\n",

      "Over the past two weeks, everyone has been talking about a small study conducted ​in France. The study, which was led by renowned  Dr. Didier Raoult which showed that 100% of patients that received a combination of HCQ and Azithromycin tested negative and were virologically cured within 6 days of treatment. But several scientists and researchers were quick to cast doubt upon his findings because the testing was not carried out in a controlled study and that the results were purely “observational.”Now for the first time, results of randomized clinical trial show hydroxychloroquine helps coronavirus patients improve, according to research paper posted at medRxiv. According to a new report from NY Times, the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine has helped to speed the recovery of a small number of patients who were mildly ill from the coronavirus. The report was based on the results of a randomized clinical trial posted at medRxiv, an online server for medical articles, before undergoing peer review by other researchers. The study was small and limited to patients who were mildly or moderately ill, not severe cases. By the way, this is the same NY Times that said about a week ago that: “No, These Medicines Cannot Cure Coronavirus”. According to the report, “cough, fever and pneumonia went away faster, and the disease seemed less likely to turn severe in people who received hydroxychloroquine than in a comparison group not given the drug. The authors of the report said that the medication was promising, but that more research was needed to clarify how it might work in treating coronavirus disease and to determine the best way to use it.”This study, which was supported by the Epidemiological Study of COVID-19 Pneumonia to Science and Technology Department of Hubei Province, aims to evaluate the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in the treatment of patients with COVID-19.“From February 4 to February 28, 2020, 62 patients suffering from COVID-19 were diagnosed and admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. All participants were randomized in a parallel-group trial, 31 patients were assigned to receive an additional 5-day HCQ (400 mg/d) treatment, Time to clinical recovery (TTCR), clinical characteristics, and radiological results were assessed at baseline and 5 days after treatment to evaluate the effect of HCQ. Key findings: For the 62 COVID-19 patients, 46.8% (29 of 62) were male and 53.2% (33 of 62) were female, the mean age was 44.7 (15.3) years,” the doctors said.In conclusion, the doctors said: “Despite our small number of cases, the potential of HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19 has been partially confirmed. Considering that there is no better option at present, it is a promising practice to apply HCQ to COVID-19 under reasonable management. However, Large-scale clinical and basic research is still needed to clarify its specific mechanism and to continuously optimize the treatment plan.”“It’s going to send a ripple of excitement out through the treating community,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University.On March 21, U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted about the wonder drug hydroxychloroquine. At the time, he was ridiculed by mainstream media with some went as far as saying the President was giving “false hope” or “misinformation.”Now, the success and effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine as treatment for coronavirus patient can no longer be ignored by the mainstream media.BREAKING: Results of the first 62 patient randomized clinical trial show hydroxychloroquine helps coronavirus patients improve\n",

      "The \"novel Coronavirus\" outbreak affecting China and many other countries right now, has been determined to be a military BIO-WEAPON, which was being worked on at the Wuhan Virology Laboratory by China's People's Liberation Army, Nanjiang Command.  Somehow, it got out.  The world is now facing a massive wipe-out of humanity as a result.The proof that this virus is a genetically-modified Bat-SARS-Like Virus, manipulated by the Chinese Army, appears below.  The evidence is irrefutable.Two separate components of genetic sequencing from HIV-1,  the virus which causes AIDS, were added to Bat-SARS-Like coronavirus in the laboratory, thereby allowing it to infect human lungs via the ACES2 receptors in our lungs, and to disrupt the human body ability to fight it off, by reducing human leukocytes.BIO-WEAPON PROOF.. Make no mistake: this disease is, in fact, a MILITARY biological weapon.   The disease sequence from the original Bat coronavirus was uploaded to the National Center for Biotechnology Information at the US National Library of Medicine, in the year 2018 by China's Institute of Military Medicine, Nanjing Command.  The image below from the National Center for Biotechnology Information proves the upload. That Bat-SARS-Like coronavirus was issued Reference ID: AVP 70833.1 by the National Center for Biotechnology Information at the U.S. Library of Medicine.The present outbreak of \"novel Coronavirus\" was uploaded to that same National Center for Biotechnology Information in January of this year by the Shanghai Public Heath Clinical Center and was issued Reference ID: QHD3418.1.  Here is proof of THAT upload. Using the test facilities known as BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) from the U.S. National Library of Medicine researchers have determined that the \"virus envelope\" of those two separate diseases, are 100% identical!   Here is the BLAST Test result. a new study shows that elements of HIV have been found in the new \"novel coronavirus!\"   From that study:We are currently witnessing a major epidemic caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019- nCoV). The evolution of 2019-nCoV remains elusive. We found 4 insertions in the spike glycoprotein (S) which are unique to the 2019-nCoV and are not present in other coronaviruses. Importantly, amino acid residues in all the 4 inserts have identity or similarity to those in the HIV-1 gp120 or HIV-1 Gag. Interestingly, despite the inserts being discontinuous on the primary amino acid sequence, 3D-modelling of the 2019-nCoV suggests that they converge to constitute the receptor binding site. The finding of 4 unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV, all of which have identity similarity to amino acid residues in key structural proteins of HIV-1 is unlikely to be fortuitous in nature.There is no way in nature that the Bat coronavirus could fortuitously acquire the HIV genetic sequences, without causing a mutation of the Virus Envelope.   The ONLY way the virus envelope could obtain the HIV genetics and still remain 100% identical to the 2018 sample, is if the HIV genes were added in a laboratory.So what the human race is now facing, is an accidentally-released military bio-weapon.  The original Bat-SARS-Like Coronavirus was identified by China's People's Liberation Army, through the Institute of Military Medicine, Nanjiang Command in the year 2018.  They uploaded the virus sequence and they were the sole entity in possession of the virus.Here we are, two years later, and the virus they had has been changed in a way that cannot occur in nature without mutating the virus envelope protein.This isn't rocket science; this is as plain as day.  China conducted genetic manipulation of their Bat-SARS-like virus and created a new virus capable of infecting humans.  That new virus was apparently accidentally-released and is the \"novel coronavirus\" the world is now battling.I am sorry to have to report, many of us are very likely to LOSE this battle.  Just like many are already losing their battle inside China and elsewhere.QUARANTINE. Within the first month of this outbreak in China, the government there effectively QUARANTINED more than fifty-six MILLION people (56000000) in nineteen (19) major cities, even though China reported publicly that only a few hundred were infected and only about 25 had died by that time.WHY?Why would China lockdown 19 cities and effectively Quarantine 56 Million people for such a trivial disease?   Because China KNEW it wasn't trivial.  China KNEW it was a military bio-weapon which had accidentally gotten out.  And China also KNEW how far this would spread and how fast.  China is guilty as sin.DISEASE FACTS:\n",
      "Here are the now-established FACTS about this disease:This disease has an eighty-three percent (83%) infection rate.  That means if 100 people are EXPOSED to this virus, 83 WILL get sick from it.The Disease can spread by AIR.  It is HIGHLY, HIGHLY contagious.When a person breathes, virus comes out with those breaths.  Same thing when a person sneezes or coughs. Same when urinating or having a bowel movement.  ALL OF IT HAS VIRUS IN IT.The virus can live OUTSIDE a person, in the air or on a surface, for a minimum of five days, and a maximum of twenty eight days.So if an infected person goes into a store or supermarket, or public bathroom, or a school, office, warehouse . . . . or anywhere . . . . touches products on shelves and puts anything back, or sneezes or coughs, his virus gets on the products in that store or supermarket, bathroom, school, office, warehouse, etc., and can survive.YOU walk-in a couple minutes, hours or even DAYS later, and pick up the same item, or even smell their stink in the bathroom - POW, you're infected.\n",
      "WORSE: This virus can infect others through the eyes and ears. Let's say you're walking inside somewhere and an infected person was there minutes earlier and coughed or sneezed.   The cough or sneeze threw microscopic droplets into the air, which float for awhile.  A few minutes later, you walk through that air.  One or more of the microscopic droplets gets on your eye.  You don't even KNOW it because the things are so small. You blink.  We all blink.Your eye lid pushes the virus off the surface of your eye, down into the bottom eye area, and the virus washes down into your tear duct.  POW- you're infected.It cannot be overstated that this virus is the worst public disease crisis the world has faced in over 100 years.  Not since the Spanish Flu of 1918 has the world faced such death and this is already heading toward being far WORSE than the Spanish Flu.The Spanish Flu spread worldwide during 1918-1919.  In the United States, it was first identified in military personnel in spring 1918. It is estimated that about 500 million people or one-third of the world’s population became infected with this virus. The number of deaths was estimated to be at least 50 million worldwide with about 675000 occurring in the United States.When a disease outbreak occurs, one of the measurements that scientists use to see how badly the disease will spread is known as R0.The 1918-1919 pandemic-causing Spanish flu is estimated to have had an R0 ranging from 1.4 – 2.8, with a mean of 2.  This means that for every person infected, that person could be expected to infect another 1.4 to 2.8 additional people.I regret to report that the R0 of this Bio-Weapon is already showing itself to be R4.08   . . .  FAAAAAAR Worse than the 1918 Spanish Flu.Here's where things get very bad, very fast.According to Satistia, the number of all hospital beds in the U.S. 1975-2017, is decreasing. In 1975, there were about 1.5 million hospital beds in the U.S., but until 2017 the number dropped to just about 931 thousand. Aug 9, 2019.According to TrendingEconomics, Hospital beds (per 1000 people) in United States was reported at 2.9 in 2013, according to the World Bank collection of development indicators, compiled from officially recognized sources. Hospital beds include inpatient beds available in public, private, general, and specialized hospitals and rehabilitation centers.Using the Infection Rate of 83% listed above, out of 1000 people exposed to this Bio-Weapon, 830 will become infected.There are 2.9 Hospital beds per thousand US citizens.  So when 830 people get infected, how many can those 2.9 hospital beds hold???????   Yea. What happens to the rest?   They cannot get hospital care.Right now, when a person cannot get hospital care for this disease, the death rate for such people is 65-70%.That means me and you.  Dead.IT CAN (AND PROBABLY WILL) HAPPEN HERE. Many of the 56 Million people in 19 Quarantined cities have not eaten in days because there is no food remaining in the cities.  This is causing rioting.Delivery trucks are prohibited from entering these contaminated cities, for fear of spreading the Coronavirus to outlying areas.  People are literally FIGHTING each other to get food:People are trying virtually anything they can to ESCAPE the quarantine, to get food:Roadblocks erected by bulldozers, bucket loaders and backhoes, consisting of large piles of dirt, rocks, and other obstructions, now appear on most roads into and out of Quarantined cities.Some of these barriers were erected by government while others were erected by people in small towns and villages to keep the infected OUT.In the meantime, people throughout China are still simply DROPPING DEAD in their tracks:People in some areas are attacking others for merely COMING IN to their neighborhood; WARNING: People hit in head with PIPES:OUTSIDE CHINA, people are also dropping dead from this virus.In Mexico, this poor man waited far too long, until the disease became Hemorrhagic;  THIS is how this disease ends. Things inside China are getting so bad, Police are now BOARDING-UP People inside their apartments to KEEP THEM IN!And MORE people Nailed-in to their own homes:And once the police leave, other people are coming and SETTING THE HOMES ON FIRE to burn the infected people to death!CHINA ORDERS ALL PETS KILLED.Residential committees, village officials and companies from various provinces and municipalities issued a strict order to locals after receiving instructions from their superiors to tackle the epidemic, it has emerged.  They have ordered citizens to \"get rid of\" their pets or face having them culled.One village in Hebei urged all households to 'deal with' their pets within five days, otherwise officials would 'handle' them altogether; while another residential committee in Shaanxi instructed people to 'consider the overall situation' and dispose of their cats and dogs immediately.China says pets can carry the bio-weapon virus and spread it to others.China is only about 30 Days into this outbreak, and their entire country and society are already collapsing.   What you see above OVER THERE, is just 30 days away from happening OVER HERE.Are you preparing?Bear in mind that all this is just ONE MONTH into the outbreak.  ONE MONTH!What we see happening in China, can -- and very likely WILL -- happen here, in America.Today (Saturday February 1) A California man has tested positive for the coronavirus, marking the seventh confirmed case in the United States.The unidentified man is a resident of Santa Clara County, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed Friday afternoon, according to local news reports.HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF.The Medical Infrastructure of the United States (and pretty much every other country) simply CANNOT HANDLE THIS from the perspective of how many get infected and how fast that happens.  There simply are not enough hospital beds, respirators, negative-pressure infectious disease isolation rooms.   Once the virus gets here in earnest (it probably already is but we won't know for ten days) the medical system will be quickly overwhelmed. We could see Medical Infrastructure COLLAPSE here in the USA the same as it is happening in China.When things go wild weasel here in America, there will be all sorts of unanticipated service disruptions. The general public remains blissfully unaware of the utter disaster coming at us, because the mass-media is keeping rather quiet about the situation.  But when they can't keep quiet any longer, there will be PANIC.You should PREPARE NOW because once the SHTF, it will be too late.Here are suggested \"Preps\" to try to get yourself and your family through what's coming.  There is precious little time left.The best strategy for this is NOT to be exposed.   Fat chance of that; we ALL go out: Work, school, shopping, recreation, and so forth.So how might we protect ourselves while we're out?Well, the fact this virus can be spread by air, in addition to staying alive on surfaces like counter tops, desks, water fountains, door handles, inside cars and buses, product packages on store shelves that someone else handled, or sneezed-on or coughed-on,  - including ones that get delivered by mail, FedEx, UPS, etc. --  complicates things greatly.Step One: Stay home.   Do not go out unless you absolutely MUST.Step Two: Presuming you have to go out (we ALL do) wear a filter mask  eye and hand protective gear (below).The N-95 filter masks are almost completely sold out already, nationwide.  So you can get a better mask rated as N-100 or P-100 for the time being until THEY sell out.  Links to various suppliers are HERE-N-95 and HERE N-100. You can also get the VASTLY AVAILABLE   3M 7500 (HERE)  which uses 3M 2091 filters  (HERE)   This mask system is more expensive, but it works and is widely still available. Get Eye Protection, either cheap swimmer goggles (HERE) or better safety goggles.Get a box of rubber/nitrile Gloves. Wear this gear when you go out.Yes, you'll look and feel ridiculous.   But you are much more likely to have the last laugh because YOU are protecting yourself.THIS IS URGENTLY IMPORTANT: The absolute moment you get home, take off your shoes and leave them in the foyer.  DO NOT WALK AROUND YOUR HOUSE IN SHOES YOU WORE OUTSIDE. \n",
      "You may have walked on a large amount of infected material as you were out and if you wear those shoes in the house, the virus will spread in the house.\n",
      "Next: Go into the bathroom, take off your clothing, put it in a hamper or plastic bag, and take a shower.  You HAVE TO WASH OFF any virus that may have landed on your body or hair, while you were out.Put on clean garments.  You cannot go sit in your chair or lay on your couch or bed in clothing you wore outside.  The virus will come off the clothing, onto the furniture and pow, someone in the house catches it.Make every person in your household do this the absolute moment they come home.  This virus is HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS and it KILLS people.  We cannot skimp or get lazy protecting ourselves.Eat right, take vitamins (I use Centrum), and, I don't want to sound hokey, or like some Bible thumper,  pray to Almighty God that you be protected by Him during this crisis.  I'm not kidding.  I mean it: PRAY.Even if you haven't prayed in decades, start now.  \"Hi God, it's me (so and so).  I know I haven't prayed to you in a long time, but I'm coming back to you now.  . . . .\"And then talk honestly and earnestly to him, in a very quiet voice.Just remember, this is God, not a magician to be summoned to do tricks or render services at our beckon call.  He made us.  We are HIS to do with a HE sees fit.OTHER \"PREPS\" with Links. Have Emergency food (HERE, HERE, and HERE) in the house in case Quarantine gets implemented, so you and your family can eat for the 6 weeks or so such Quarantines are likely to last. Have Emergency Water (HERE) stored up in case the water supply gets contaminated.Here is a complete list of \"Preps\" that folks might consider for themselves.Please pass this article along to those you care about; No other source is providing this type of self-help advice and there isn't much time left before all hell breaks loose.PROOF: The \"Novel Coronavirus\" Infecting the World is a MILITARY BIO-WEAPON Developed by China's Army\n",

      "As if we didn't have enough to worry about with terrorism, nuclear proliferation and, yes, political enemies, now we have the threat – in fact, a very real one – of what could be an international health catastrophe.And it all goes back to China.There's a new and apparently deadly virus circulating in that country, but what has health officials worldwide worried is that it is spreading faster than first anticipated. It started in Wuhan, China, in late December but by mid-January had spread to 13 countries.Despite that, World Health Organization officials are reluctant to call it a Public Health Emergency.What do we call that kind of disease spread? According to WHO officials, an \"epidemic\" is a disease that spreads in a smaller community, country, region or continent.That certainly gives it wide leeway.The next category is a \"pandemic,\" a disease, usually a new one, that spreads worldwide with terrible numbers of deaths.From what we are seeing now, I think we're well on our way to that situation, although health officials so far are playing it safe with their predictions.The culprit is called a \"coronavirus.\" It's new – never been seen before. We don't know where it came from, There is no prevention, no cure, and even treatment is limited.What's interesting is that China has a National Biosafety Laboratory in Wuhan. It opened in January 2018, and it's dedicated to studying such viruses such as SARS and Ebola – and, yes, corona. There has been speculation that perhaps the virus got loose from the lab and that is what started it all.Regardless, at this point, China has quarantined the entire city of Wuhan and is doing the same with at least 13 other cities, canceled Chinese New Year Celebrations; parts of The Great Wall are shut down; Disneyland in Shanghai is closed, as are many McDonald's restaurants across the country. Millions of people are affected by the crackdown on travel.The government had ordered the immediate building of a new hospital to treat coronavirus patients because existing facilities are filled to their limits. Transportation has been limited; the military is on the streets; and in fact, it appears the country is virtually locked down.While there hasn't been an official notice of the dangers of the massive spread of the disease, airlines and airports across the world are taking precautions. Passengers are being checked for symptoms of a cold or flu, and their temperatures are being monitored.Screening at U.S. airports began at Kennedy in New York, in Los Angeles and San Francisco. Then Atlanta was added, as well as O'Hare in Chicago. Others are being added as suspicious cases are discovered.A man in Seattle was diagnosed, then a woman in Chicago who'd just returned from China. Cases are being monitored in Texas involving a returning passenger from Mexico, and possible patients at Tennessee Tech and Texas A&M.The CDC is testing 63 other cases, and it's reported there are 10 people in isolation in California for further study.There is concern about all transportation to and from China of people and merchandise.While there is caution in predicting the outcome of this disease spread, scientists warn that worldwide, tens of millions could die. Scientists at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Safety said 65 million could die as the disease spreads worldwide in 18 months.As I write, coronavirus has been found in China, the U.S., Nepal, Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, Macau, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan and South Korea, with suspicious cases in Australia, New Zealand, England, Scotland and Ireland – and at least 26 are dead. That's probably a gross understatement.It isn't known for certain HOW people contract it – first thoughts were that it came from contact with animals, either by contact or through eating them.Now, it's just been determined that it is possible for it to spread from person-to-person. Transmission is through saliva, which means that kissing, coughing or sneezing is a danger but eating utensils could also transmit it. Symptoms are like a cold – coughing, sneezing, sore throat, runny nose, difficulty breathing, fever and then collapse. Pneumonia then follows, then death.We cannot cure it. It's difficult to contain. Antibiotics don't work, and anti-viral drugs and vaccines don't exist, nor will they for a long time – it does take time and costs millions. For many victims, it will be too late.This isn't the first time the world has been hit with a massive pandemic – the Spanish Flu in 1918 killed 20-50 million, Cholera flues in the 1800s killed over 2 million, the Black Death in Europe killed upwards of 200 million and devastated the continent. More recently, there was AIDS, Zica, SARS and Ebola.One aspect of the disease is the effect on the economy. Without doubt, travel has been affected. It's reported that shares in travel markets in China and Hong Kong dropped, but one market share has surged: companies that make surgical masks!Hold your breath – coronavirus is coming!\n",

      "A group of medical doctors, healthcare providers and scientists met online March 17, 2020, to discuss the use of high dose intravenous vitamin C (IVC) in the treatment of moderate to severe cases of Covid-19 patients. The key guest was Dr. Enqian Mao, chief of emergency medicine department at Ruijin Hospital, a major hospital in Shanghai, affiliated with the Joatong University College of Medicine. Dr. Mao is also a member of the Senior Expert Team at the Shanghai Public Health Center, where all Covid-19 patients have been treated. In addition, Dr. Mao co-authored the Shanghhai Guidelines for the Treatment of Covid-19 Infection, an official document endorsed by the Shanghai Medical Association and the Shanghai city government.Dr. Mao has been using high-dose dose IVC to treat patients with acute pancreatitis, sepsis, surgical wound healing and other medical conditions for over 10 years. When Covid-19 broke out, he and other experts thought of vitamin C and recommended IVC for the treatment of moderate to severe cases of Covid-19 patients. The recommendation was accepted early in the epidemic by the Shanghai Expert Team. All serious or critically ill Covid-19 patients in the Shanghai area were treated in Shanghai Public Health Center, for a total of 358 Covid-19 patients as of March 17th, 2020.Dr. Mao stated that his group treated ~50 cases of moderate to severe cases of Covid-19 infection with high dose IVC. The IVC dosing was in the range of 10000 mg - 20000 mg a day for 7-10 days, with 10000 mg for moderate cases and 20000 for more severe cases, determined by pulmonary status (mostly the oxygenation index) and coagulation status. All patients who received IVC improved and there was no mortality. Compared to the average of a 30-day hospital stay for all Covid-19 patients, those patients who received high dose IVC had a hospital stay about 3-5 days shorter than the overall patients. Dr. Mao discussed one severe case in particular who was deteriorating rapidly. He gave a bolus of 50000 mg IVC over a period of 4 hours. The patient's pulmonary (oxygenation index) status stabilized and improved as the critical care team watched in real time. There were no side effects reported from any of the cases treated with high dose IVC.\n",
      "Among the international experts who attended today's video conference were: Dr. Atsuo Yanagisawa, formerly professor of medicine at the Kyorin University, Tokyo, Japan, and the president of the International Society for Orthomolecular Medicine; Dr. Jun Matsuyama of Japan; Dr. Michael J Gonzalez, professor at University of Puerto Rico Medical Sciences, Dr. Jean Drisko, professor of medicine, and Dr. Qi Chen, professor of pharmacology, both at the Kansas University Medical School, Dr. Alpha \"Berry\" Fowler, professor of pulmonary and critical care medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Dr. Maurice Beer and Asa Kitfield, both from NutriDrip and Integrative Medical NY, New York City; Dr. Hong Zhang of Beijing; William T. Penberthy, PhD of CME Scribe, Florida; Ilyes Baghli, MD, president of the Algerian Society of Nutrition and Orthomolecular Medicine (SANMO); Drs. Mignonne Mary and Charles Mary Jr, of the Remedy Room, New Orleans; Dr. Selvam Rengasamy, president of SAHAMM, Malaysia. I, Richard Cheng, MD, PhD of Cheng Integrative Health Center of South Carolina, and Senior Advisor to ShenZhen Medical Association and Shenzhen BaoAn Central Hospital, coordinated this conference.Albeit a brief meeting of less than 45 minutes due to Dr. Mao's limited time availability, the audience thanked Dr. Mao for his time and sharing and wished to keep the communication channel open and also able to talk to other clinicians working at the front line against Covid-19.In a separate meeting, I had the honor to talk to Sheng Wang, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Critical Care Medicine of Shanghai 10th Hospital, Tongji University College of Medicine at Shanghai China, who also served at the Senior Clinical Expert Team of the Shanghai Covid-19 Control and Prevention Team. There are three lessons that we learned about this Covid-19 infection, Dr. Wang said:Early and high-dose IVC is quite helpful in helping Covid-19 patients. The data is still being finalized and the formal papers will be submitted for publication as soon as they are complete.Covid-19 patients appear to have a high rate of hyper-coagulability. Among the severe cases, ~40% severe cases showed hyper-coagulability, whereas the number among the mild to moderate cases were 15-20%. Heparin was used among those with coagulation issues.The third important lesson learned is the importance for the healthcare team of gearing up to wear protective clothing at the earliest opportunity for intubation and other emergency rescue measures. We found that if we waited until a patient developed the full-blown signs for intubation, then got ready to intubate, we would lose the precious minutes. So the treatment team should lower the threshold for intubation, to allow proper time (~15 minutes or so) for the team to gear up. This critical 15-30 minutes could make a difference in the outcome.Also, both Drs. Mao and Wang confirmed that there are other medical teams in other parts of the country who have been using high dose IVC treating Covid-19 patients.For additional reporting and information on China's successful use of intravenous vitamin C against COVID-19Successful High-Dose Vitamin C Treatment of Patients with Serious and Critical COVID-19 Infection\n",

      "URGENT! Practical Advice for Coronavirus Prevention and Holistic Remediation. CORONAVIRUS Precautionary Measures and Health Tips.The Coronavirus Coach.The rapidly unfolding coronavirus pandemic should not be underestimated. Given what is known thus far, this highly contagious virus ought to be taken seriously by everyone. Hence, every person on the planet is encouraged to get their house in order (especially the medicine cabinet) so that they are ready for any eventuality.It’s always best to take these proven preventive measures sooner than later where it concerns any type of viral infection. By doing so, even the various coronavirus infections can be avoided. Folks who can sequester themselves in their home offices and/or significantly reduce their exposure to public places always fare much better. “Catching the corona” is by no means a foregone conclusion for any individual.List of Basic Things To Do.First, start to eat right (LOTs of garlic and ginger and turmeric and curried foods). Lean toward hot soups, stews and broths particularly at dinner time for the rest of the flu season. Avoid cold foods from the fridge especially yoghurt, sandwich spreads and cold drinks. Add just a little boiling water to quickly warm up juices as well as nut or seed milks. Frozen foods like ice cream are strictly forbidden. Cook all vegetables much softer than usual. Best to go vegan, if possible; otherwise, all animal meats ought to be very well cooked and eaten infrequently.Drink Flu Tea, especially during the cold season (the essential ingredients are ginger, cayenne pepper, lemon and honey but don’t heat the lemon or the honey–add them after the fresh ginger tea is brewed). Also drink plenty of warm fluids, specifically herbal teas that are decongestants and expectorants. Herbal teas that have antimicrobial and immune-stimulating properties are important when viral infection symptoms are present.\n",
      "Be regular about replenishing the diminished intestinal flora with probiotics; beverage and food-based forms are much preferred to nutraceuticals (e.g. capsules). For those with lactose intolerance and/or casein allergies, acquire some coconut, cashew or almond yogurt or kefir (let these warm up first before eating). Also, consider probiotic rectal implants when significant flora depletion is suspected.Be sure to stay away from mucus-producing foods and beverages. Avoid dairy in particular (especially cheese, milk and ice cream). Also avoid wheat, white sugar, red meat, eggs, soy, alcohol, artificially sweetened sodas, desserts in general, etc. This is a great time to minimize the intake of processed foods, packaged food, canned food, frozen food and especially junk food and fast food. “Corporate food” in supermarkets ought to be reduced; fresh produce, whole grains, organic ingredients, etc. are much healthier choices. The shorter the distance from farm to table the better.If restaurant food cannot be avoided, be careful to only order the most cooked items on the menu. Raw foods and dairy products are quite exposed to environmental pathogens as well as highly vulnerable to kitchen mismanagement practices and other types of contamination. Don’t eat out unless you must. And, go organic, fresh, locally-grown and what’s in season IN YOUR OWN KITCHEN. Remember: “The cure is in the kitchen.”Start to transition your diet from acidifying foods to alkalizing foods so that you move to approx. 75% alkaline and 25% acidic. Especially cut down on constipating foods, beverages and nutraceuticals such as mineral supplements with too much Iron.Regular Exercise and Stretching, Power Walking and Rebounding, Hatha Yoga and Pilates, Tai chi and Qigong are all great to do. Get as much exposure to Sunlight as possible for natural Vitamin D production. (Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants so the coronavirus doesn’t like it). A 20 to 30 minute aerobic walk in nature is the single best way to cleanse the entire lymphatic system—A MUST![1] Don’t power walk outside when the skies are heavily chemtrailed; you’ll feel the health consequences.The respiratory system must be clear and clean, strong and efficient since this virus targets the mucus membranes in the lungs and sinuses. Use a Neti Pot regularly during this flu season with 1/4 tsp of sea salt dissolved in body-temperature distilled water. Have a saline nasal rinse kit on hand such as NEILMED’S SINUS RINSE. Breathwork as simple as daily deep breathing outside in the fresh air is highly recommended; so are certain pranayama practices. Coherent breathing is particularly effective in activating the body’s natural immune response.Try to sleep well between 10:00 PM and 4:00 AM every night. Keep all technology out of the bedroom including smartphones and TVs. Remove all light sources, cover the windows, and use an air purifier that generates white noise to cover up distracting night-time sounds.Change all IT devices in the home from wireless and WiFi to wired connections. Even keyboards and mice ought to be hardwired. Those living or working in a 5G environment ought to eliminate all WiFi completely.Use wired landline phones whenever possible, NOT smartphones. There are also free Internet-based phone lines available that are easily hardwired. Replace the smartphone with an old-fashioned 4G flip phone. (Wuhan City, China was designated a special “5G Demonstration Zone” in the months prior to the coronavirus outbreak.Assemble a first aid kit with Colloidal Silver or Silver Hydrosol, Zinc supplements, Turmeric power or extract, Vitamin C and Vitamin D. Have a CAL-MAG-POT mineral supplement handy as well as some Selenium.Acquire some anti-microbial Essential Oils (especially Oils of Oregano, Basil, Thyme & Peppermint). Get some Thieves essential oil and an atomizer to diffuse in the ambient environment, particularly the bedroom before sleep!Also, have Olive Leaf extract, Pau d’Arco tea and an Echinacea & Goldenseal combo in the medicine cabinet. Buy some Grapefruit Seed extract, in liquid form, for all sorts of medicinal and body care applications.Keep some food-grade Hydrogen Peroxide in the fridge in the event that low-dose HP therapy becomes necessary. Lugol’s Iodine is an absolute must when fighting any coronavirus, and especially effective for cleaning ALL produce. Buy some BAC-HP homeopathic remedy to quickly subdue any bacterial infections that can weaken immunity (Purchase link HERE).Have a good supply of Sea Salt available for gargling as well as Rock Salt for cooking. Pink Himalayan Salt is especially good for medicinal use. Manuka Honey has strong antibacterial and antiviral properties as well as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits.Mouth care should include daily tongue scraping first thing in the morning followed by a Sovereign Silver mouth bath (hold 1 tbsp of silver in mouth for 20 to 30 minutes after teeth-brushing.Then spit it out and thoroughly rinse mouth with water. For us health nuts, this can be followed with 15 t0 20 minutes of oil pulling by swishing around in the mouth 1 tbsp of either sesame or coconut oil. (The toothbrush should be washed with peppermint soap after each use and soaked in hydrogen peroxide at least once a week.For those who get really sick or really are ambitious, do a coffee enema. There’s no quicker way to cleanse and refresh the liver blood. Moreover, performing a gallbladder flush / liver cleanse is an effective way to decongest the liver which then enhances the detoxification pathways during sickness, disease or injury.\n",
      "Take a crash course in strengthening your immune system at this website: The Health Coach. For those who are chronically experiencing any form of immunosuppression, it’s imperative to do an immune system checkup. Particularly for those folks who have suffered from any of the Chronic Degenerative Diseases or Third Millennium Maladies or Alphabet Soup Ailments (e.g. CFS, EBV, AIDS, HIV, COPD, MS, ALS, Lupus, Lyme, Morgellons, Fibromyalgia, Rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune disorders), conducting a systematic immune system audit is a MUST. Whereas a strong immune response is the BEST defense against the coronavirus, even a compromised immune system can be quickly strengthened. For example, an infected root canal or cavitation site can be properly remediated thereby removing a constant burden from the immune system.Wash hands thoroughly for at least 20 to 30 seconds with an anti-microbial soap after being out in public but especially after handling all mail and parcels; raw food items; and food packaging such as boxes, cans, cartons, bottles, plastic containers as well as beverage cups.Regularly sanitize all door handles and faucet handles as well as vehicle door handles and the steering wheel. Be sure to keep Ethyl Alcohol and Distilled White Vinegar on hand to disinfect contaminated surfaces, especially in the kitchen and bathrooms. There are individually wrapped hand wipes, which use alcohol to kill pathogenic micro-organisms on contact, to keep in the vehicle as well as hand sanitizers that do the same for the home and office.[5] . Above all, avoid touching your eyes, ears, nose or mouth (your head, for that matter) with unwashed hands.This particular strain of coronavirus could develop into a serious situation (i.e. Pandemic) which will then require great vigilance and resolve. Be alert to any unusual symptoms in the home and workplace for yourself and others. Stay away from any individual who is presenting any type of flu symptoms.Avoid all public places, when practical, for the rest of this flu season. If you are the family caregiver or a healthcare provider, take all the extra precautionary measures to avoid exposure (wear the right type of hospital-grade mask rated as N95 anti-viral, wash hands regularly with antimicrobial soap, keep a safe distance when appropriate, etc.). Disinfect, Sanitize and Cleanse whatever, wherever and whenever necessary. The kitchen and bathrooms need to be cleaner than ever since that’s where most illness and disease begin.Don’t travel unnecessarily. Especially avoid airplanes, trains, buses, subways and cruise ships. At least for the rest of this flu season, minimize attendance at family gatherings, office parties, restaurants, etc. Skip all the conventions, conferences, forums, seminars and other large meeting places this year, particularly those with overnight stays.Lastly, stay out of fear and live life with courage during these challenging times. Have faith in the Higher Power and know that everything always happens for the best. Pray for protection for yourself, your family and friends, and all of humanity.Here’s How Everyone Can Avoid Getting The Coronavirus\n",

      "Unlike SARS and swine flu, the novel coronavirus is both highly contagious and especially deadly, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said.\n",
      "“SARS was also a coronavirus, and it was a new virus at the time,” Gupta said. “In the end, we know that SARS ended up infecting 8000 people around the world and causing around 800 deaths. So very high fatality rate, but it didn’t turn out to be very contagious.”The swine flu, or H1N1, “was very contagious and infected some 60 million people in the United States alone within a year,” Gupta said. “But it was far less lethal than the flu even — like 1/3 as lethal as the flu.”What makes the novel coronavirus different is that “this is both very contagious … and it appears to be far more lethal than the flu as well,” Gupta said. “So both those things, in combination I think, are why we’re taking this so seriously.”What’s so different about coronavirus that we have to shut down businesses? Why practice social distancing now, when we didn’t during the SARS and swine flu epidemics?\n",

      "Today, the Commission offered up to €80 million of financial support to CureVac, a higly innovative vaccine developer from Tübingen, Germany, to scale up development and production of a vaccine against the Coronavirus in Europe. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, Mariya Gabriel, discussed with the CureVac management via videoconference. The Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), Ambroise Fayolle, also participated. The support would come in form of an EU guarantee of a currently assessed EIB loan of an identical amount, in the framework of the InnovFin Infectious Disease Finance Facility under Horizon 2020. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said: “In this public health crisis it is of utmost importance that we support our leading researchers and tech companies. We are determined to provide CureVac with the financing it needs to quickly scale up development and production of a vaccine against the Coronavirus. I am proud that we have leading companies like CureVac in the EU. Their home is here. But their vaccines will benefit everyone, in Europe and beyond.” Mariya Gabriel, Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, said: “Supporting excellent EU research and innovation is an essential part of our coordinated response against the spread of the Coronavirus. In 2014, CureVac won EU's first ever innovation inducement prize. We are committed to support further its EU-based research and innovation in these critical times. Science and innovation in Europe are at the heart of our policies for protecting people's health.” Ambroise Fayolle, Vice-President for Innovation in the European Investment Bank, said: “The EIB is and remains the EU Bank for innovation, even more than ever in the current health crisis. Thanks to our strong and fruitful long partnership with the Commission in the area of research and innovation financial instruments (InnovFin), we are determined to do our best to support CureVac scale up needs for the benefits of EU citizen and beyond.” Founded in 2000, CureVac is a German biopharmaceutical company that has developed a novel technology to overcome one of the biggest barriers to using vaccines: the need to keep them stable without refrigeration. Its vaccine technology is based on messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules that stimulate the immune system. Preliminary studies have shown that the technology holds a promise for rapid response to COVID-19. If proven, millions of vaccine doses could potentially be produced at low costs in existing CureVac production facilities. CureVac has already started its COVID-19 vaccine development program and estimates to launch clinical testing by June 2020. The Commission recognised CureVac's potential to bring life-saving vaccines to people across the planet in safe and affordable ways already in 2014 when CureVac received the first ever EU innovation inducement prize of €2 million, funded by the EU's research and innovation programme, FP7. The award was intended to support further development of the breakthrough idea. Now the Commission and the EIB are strengthening jointly their efforts to provide the necessary means to CureVac, taking advantage of their long and fruitful cooperation in financial instruments dedicated to support research and innovation such as Horizon 2020 InnovFin and in particular its Infectious Disease Finance Facility. Background The support to CureVac is part of coordinated EU response to the public health threat of COVID-19. Working closely with the industry, the Commission has mobilised up to €140 million in public and private funding to support urgently needed research. On 6 March, the Commission announced that it selected 17 projects involving 136 research teams to receive a total funding of €47.5 million from its research and innovation programme, Horizon 2020. The teams will work on developing vaccines, new treatments, diagnostic tests and medical systems aimed at preventing the spread of the Coronavirus. In addition, the Commission has committed up to €45 million for research on vaccines and treatments through a call published on 3 March by the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI), which is to be matched by the pharma industry, so up to €90 million in all. In the past years the European Commission has invested greatly in research to prepare exactly for this type of public health emergency. Several EU funded projects are currently contributing to the European and global preparedness and response activities.Coronavirus: Commission offers financing to innovative vaccines company CureVac\n",

      "The highest level of court in Chhina, Supreme People’s Court, is expected to give an approval on Friday for the mass killing of coronavirus patients in China as sure means of controlling the spread of the deadly virus. The State tells the court that China is on the verge of losing its health workers to Coronavirus as at least 20 health workers contract the virus daily. The State argues that coronavirus patients admitted at hospitals only have their deaths delayed and infect many others while receiving care at the hospital. China has been under criticism for human rights violations and organizations have questioned China’s approach in dealing with the Coronavirus outbreak and it is believed the country has already killed many of its coronavirus patients.China seek for court’s approval to kill the over 20000 coronavirus patients to avoid further spread of the virus\n",

By the time you have fever and/or cough and go to the hospital, the lung is usually 50% fibrosis. Taiwan experts provide a simple self-check that we can do every morning: Take a deep breath and hold it for more than 10 seconds. If you do this successfully without coughing, without discomfort, stiffness or tightness, there is no fibrosis in the lungs; it basically indicates no infection. In critical times, please self-check every morning in an environment with clean air.\n",

However, that immunity could diminish over time and you would still be susceptible to a different coronavirus infection. Or, this particular virus could mutate, just like the influenza virus does each year. Often these mutations change the virus enough to make you susceptible, because your immune system thinks it is an infection that it has never seen before.Can a person who has had coronavirus get infected again?\n",

      "In a speech on immigration reform in El Paso, Texas, President Barack Obama said his administration has focused on deporting illegal immigrants convicted of crimes.\n",
      "\"Beyond the border, we’re going after employers who knowingly exploit people and break the law,\" Obama said in the speech on May 10, 2011. \"And we are deporting those who are here illegally. And that’s a tough issue. It’s a source of controversy.\n",
      "\"But I want to emphasize we’re not doing it haphazardly. We’re focusing our limited resources and people on violent offenders and people convicted of crimes -- not just families, not just folks who are just looking to scrape together an income. And as a result, we’ve increased the removal of criminals by 70 percent.\"\n",
      "Obama's claim that under his administration, deportation of criminals increased by 70 percent suggests a significant shift in policy, so we decided to check it out.\n",
      "According to data provided by the Department of Homeland Security, the number of illegal immigrants \"removed\"  rose about 6 percent  -- from 369221 to 392862  -- between the end of September 2008 (four months before Obama took office) and the end of September 2010. But a much larger percentage of those deported were convicted criminals. In 2008, 31 percent were criminals; but by 2010, the percentage jumped to 50 percent.\n",
      "The raw number of convicted criminals who were deported went from 114415 in 2008 to 195772 in 2010. That's 71 percent. So that squares with Obama's claim.\n",
      "Data for the first half of the 2011 fiscal year (which began at the end of September) suggests that trend is continuing, with about 52 percent of the deportations involving convicted criminals.\n",
      "In an Oct. 6, 2010, press release , Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said the numbers reflect the administration's \"prioritizing the identification and removal of criminal aliens who pose a threat to public safety.\"\n",
      "\"Our approach has yielded historic results, removing more convicted criminal aliens than ever before and issuing more financial sanctions on employers who knowingly and repeatedly violate immigration laws than during the entire previous administration,\" Napolitano said.\n",
      "Roy Beck, executive director of NumbersUSA, a group that favors reducing immigration into the United States, said it's true that the deportation rate, particularly deportation of convicted criminals, has been higher under Obama.\n",
      "\"My sense is that Obama deserves credit, for all the complaints about him, that he has done maybe a little better than Bush on deportations,\" Beck said. \"I think the main context, though, is that the amount of deportations under Bush was rather small.\"\n",
      "And even under Obama, Beck said, the administration is talking about fewer than 400000 deportations in a country with an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants.\n",
      "DHS statistics show that under Bush, overall deportations more than tripled between 2001 and 2008 -- going from 116782 to 369221. But in the latter part of Bush's presidency, the biggest jump was in the deportation of illegal immigrants who were were not convicted criminals. During the eight years of Bush's presidency, deportation of convicted criminals rose from 71079 in 2001 to 114415 in 2008. That's a 61 percent increase over eight years.\n",
      "In the first two years under Obama, the data suggest a policy shift toward prioritizing the deportation of convicted criminals. And Obama is correct that there has been a 70 percent increase.The Obama administration increased the deportation of illegal immigrants convicted of crimes by 70 percent.\n",

      "Sen. Judd Gregg, a Republican senator from New Hampshire, has been making the rounds on political news programs this week, criticizing President Barack Obama's budget as too costly.\n",
      "Gregg has repeated one statistic over and over to make his point: that Obama's budget plan would increase the national debt to 80 percent of gross domestic product.\n",
      "\"Seventeen trillion dollars worth of debt at the end of 10 years, $11 trillion at the end of five years,\" Gregg said. \"This translates into a debt-to-GDP ratio which we have not seen in this country since the end of World War II when we were trying to pay off the war debt. Basically, you take national debt up to about 80 percent of gross national product. That's the public debt. Historically, it's been about 40 percent.\"\n",
      "At 80 percent, Gregg has been fond of saying this week, the United States would be getting into \"banana republic\" territory.\n",
      "Debt-to-GDP ratios may not get a lot of public attention, but economists follow them closely as a good indicator of economic health.\n",
      "\"Over the long haul, that is the most important number,\" Brian Riedl, a research fellow in federal budget policy at the conservative Heritage  Foundation.\n",
      "Gregg's numbers come from an analysis of the Obama budget by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which concluded that the national debt would grow by $9.3 trillion between 2010 and 2019 under Obama's plan. According to the CBO, the debt held by the public would rise, from 41 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2008 to 57 percent in 2009 and then to 82 percent of GDP by 2019. That comports with Gregg's statement.\n",
      "Projections put out by the administration's Office of Management and Budget in February were a little more optimistic, due largely to differing assumptions about the future growth of the economy. According to the White House forecasts, the national debt-to-GDP ration would rise to 67 percent in 2019.\n",
      "Still, by either count, the debt-to-GDP ratios are climbing.\n",
      "Gregg is right that since the post-World War II years, debt-to-GDP has averaged about 42 percent. He's also right that if the debt-to-GDP ratio rises to 82 percent in 2019, that would be a level we have not seen in the United States since World War II. According to historical budget tables, the debt-to-GDP ratios actually climbed over 100 percent, peaking at 109 percent in 1946. Since then, the ratios have spiked occasionally as a result of recession or war, but have never gone above about 50 percent. That will change this year.\n",
      "It's less clear if that 82 percent would put us in the \"banana republic\" range. According to the\n",
      "CIA World Factbook,\n",
      "the United States has the 22nd highest level of public debt as a percentage of GDP in the world. There are no separate statistics for banana republics, but it's worth noting that many Latin American countries have a lower public debt ratio than the United States.\n",
      "Regardless, Gregg is right that 82 percent would be remarkably high and put the country in unenviable company.\n",
      "So why should we care?\n",
      "If the debt-to-GDP level were to go to 82 percent, Heritage's Riedl said, \"It's a simple fact that interest rates would go through the roof.\"\n",
      "Moreover, he said, it would be harder for companies to borrow money; harder for people to get mortgages. It would decrease productivity and overall economic growth.\n",
      "\"It's just not a sustainable ratio,\" Riedl said.\n",
      "Jonathan DeWald, a spokesman for the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan  organization that specializes in analysis of budget deficits, also cautioned that as interest rates increase in coming years, interest payments on the growing national debt will continue to eat up more and more of the overall budget.\n",
      "Obama has warned not to place too much stock in the \"out years\" of budget  projections because \"none of us know exactly what's going to happen six or eight  or 10 years from now.\" And Obama has said that making investments today in education, health care and energy will pay off down the road with a stronger economy, which presumably would create a better debt-to-GDP ratio.\n",
      "Gregg is on solid ground, relying on projections from the CBO, a highly respected, nonpartisan arm of Congress, about the long-term debt-to-GDP ratios.Obama's budget plan would \"take national debt up to about 80 percent of gross national product. ...

      "\"Our government right now -- this is significant -- we are spending 40 percent more than what we take in,\" Bachmann said during a Republican presidential debate on Oct. 11, 2011, at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H.\n",
      "The Congressional Budget Office has released preliminary figures for Fiscal Year 2011, which ended Sept. 30. According to the CBO’s chart , the federal government had revenues of $2.3 trillion and expenditures of $3.6 trillion, leaving a deficit of $1.3 trillion.\n",

      "We knew the most recent recession was bad, but we hadn’t realized it was so bad in comparison to other recent recessions. So we decided to check whether Will was right.\n",
      "We turned to two sources. One is the National Bureau of Economic Research, an independent group of economists that is the de facto arbiter of when recessions begin and end. The other is the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal agency that calculates all manner of employment figures.\n",

      "\"Great Recession\" -- Dec. 2007 to June 2009: 7490000 jobs lost\n",
      "So the numbers show that Will is right -- about 850000 more jobs were lost during the great recession than in the previous four recessions combined.\n",
      "We wondered, though, whether the result would be different if we factored in the size of the labor force, which has grown over the past three decades. It’s impossible to make the same exact comparison Will did -- that is, comparing the sum of the past four recessions with the current one -- because you can’t simply add together percentages drawn from different time periods.

      "During an interview with Fox & Friends, Ivanka Trump discussed one of the challenges of the current economy -- that job vacancies exist, but many people who aren’t working aren’t qualified to fill them. Her comments came during a week that the White House had devoted to messages about the American workforce.\n",
      "\"There are currently 6 million jobs available in this country that are due in part to the skills gap,\" she said.\n",
      "When we took a closer look, we found that Trump was generally on target, but that the impact of the \"skills gap\" -- the fact that many potential workers don’t have the right qualifications to take jobs that are currently open -- is worth some explanation.\n",
      "Are there 6 million jobs available?\n",
      "On the numerical side, Trump was spot-on.\n",
      "Every month, the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics releases data from a survey called the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey , or JOLTS. One of the key statistics in the survey is job openings nationally.\n",
      "In the most recent month for which data is available -- April 2017 -- the survey found 6044000 job openings across the country. That represents the first time this statistic has ever crossed the 6 million line, going back to the earliest data reported in 2000.\n",
      "Since a measure of the raw number of job openings is affected by overall population growth over time, we’ll also note that the rate of job openings -- which is adjusted for the size of the U.S. population -- also tied a record in April, reaching a level equaled only in two previous months going back to 2000.\n",
      "So Trump has accurately portrayed the scale of how many jobs are available today in the United States.\n",
      "Is this large number of job openings 'due in part to the skills gap'?\n",
      "Trump used cautious wording; Economists agree that a mismatch of skills is clearly a \"part\" of the problem, as she put it. That said, they cautioned against making the oversimplified argument that the skills gap underlies all 6 million job openings.\n",
      "On the one hand, \"some of the current job vacancies are unquestionably due to the skills gap,\" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. \"If job-seeking jobless workers and promotion-seeking but under-employed workers had exactly the right skills, many of the current job vacancies could be filled faster.\"\n",
      "At the same time, for many job openings, the barrier isn’t necessarily the lack of a college degree or specialized training, he said. In many cases, the \"barrier\" can be overcome with on-the-job training and experience.\n",
      "\"There are many job openings with more modest skill requirements,\" Burtless said. \"They require the new hire to learn some extra skills to become more proficient and productive in their new jobs.

      "He added that \"employers who think every job opening can be filled immediately and with a perfectly trained worker are either living in a dream world or living through a Great Depression in which millions of highly trained workers are desperately seeking a job.\" The reality, he said, is that \"for most current job vacancies, the skill set of today’s job seekers is sufficient to fill the great majority of the vacancies.\"\n",
      "Another economist, Aparna Mathur of the American Enterprise Institute, has testified that for many manufacturing jobs, a drag on hiring comes not only from a skills gap but also an \"image gap.\"\n",
      "Millennials in particular, she said, may have a \"tainted\" image of what high-tech manufacturing jobs look like today, assuming instead that they are like such jobs decades ago -- \"dirty, grimy, repetitive or dangerous.\" Survey data shows that \"many workers are no longer interested in manufacturing jobs and there appears to be a stigma attached to manufacturing work,\" she wrote. \"Few parents want their children to work in this industry, and manufacturing is the last career choice for people between the ages of 19 and 33.\"\n",
      "In an interview, Mathur said it’s difficult to tease out how much of a factor the skills gap is in today’s job openings. She suggested that it may be the biggest factor -- but she also cautioned that the image gap is particularly significant for younger workers and added that other issues exist as well, including an unwillingness among some Americans to relocate to areas with jobs.\n",
      "And of course, even in an efficiently humming economy, any survey taken at a given point in time will find many jobs that are simply open due to transition, or what economists call \"churn.\" Many of these job openings will be due to happenstance rather than structural problems with the skills gap.\"There are currently 6 million jobs available in this country that are due in part to the skills gap.\"\n",

      "On NBC’s Meet the Press on Jan. 4, 2015, Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said the new Republican Congress’ first priority in 2015 will be to pass a bill approving construction of the oil pipeline, which would stretch from Canada to Steele City, Neb., where it would connect with an existing pipeline that goes to the coast of Texas.\n",

      "Here’s a chart showing the trend from the Energy Information Administration:\n",
      "In the third quarter of 2014 -- the most recent available data -- the United States produced 14.2 million barrels of oil per day; Saudi Arabia produced 11.7 million per day; and Russia produced 10.5 million per day. Together, that’s about 40 percent of total global production.\n",
      "This production growth has contributed to the United States’ ability to produce more oil than it imports for the first time in about 20 years.\n",
      "The Energy Information Administration expects American production to continue to grow in 2015, despite recent lower crude oil prices.\n",
      "Total oil production figures include crude oil, natural gas liquids and other liquid energy products.\n",
      "On top of oil , the United States produces significantly more natural gas than Saudi Arabia. According to the Energy Information Administration, United States energy production is about evenly split between petroleum and natural gas. Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, primarily produces petroleum.\n",
      "The majority of the United States’ oil production growth is concentrated in four regions: Bakken, N.D., Eagle Ford, Texas, the Niobrara region in the Upper Midwest, and the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico.\n",
      "North Dakota and Texas together comprise almost 50 percent of all crude oil production in the United States -- compared to 2010, when the two states combined produced just 26 percent of all United States crude oil production.\n",
      "In 2013, energy markets consultant group PIRA Energy published a report that said shale production is one of the driving forces behind the country’s production growth. Shale oil and gas are commonly associated with hydraulic fracturing , or fracking, which is the process of using water pressure to fracture a rock to release natural gas and oil. The United States is the world leader in shale gas production.\n",
      "There is at least one piece of context to keep in mind when looking at the United States’ oil production compared to Saudi Arabia, noted Leonardo Maugeri, an associate at Harvard University’s Geopolitics of Energy project. Saudi Arabia has a higher capacity than the United States to produce oil, but it chooses not to use it all -- so as not to inundate the global oil market.\n",

      "Hillary Clinton is running to become the first female president in American history. But even as she makes her potentially historic run, the number of women in Congress remains far from parity with men, said Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine.\n",
      "\"In Congress right now, we're doing the best job we have ever done in women in the Federal legislature, 19 percent,\" said Kaine, a U.S. senator from Virginia. \"That's the best job we've ever done. Hold on for this, folks: Nineteen percent ranks the United States 75th in the world, below the global average. Iraq is 26 percent. Afghanistan, 28 percent. Number one? Rwanda, 64 percent.\"\n",
      "We wondered if Kaine is correct that \"in Congress right now, we're doing the best job we have ever done in women in the federal legislature,\" but it’s still only \"19 percent.\"\n",
      "First, let’s look at the 19 percent number.\n",
      "According to the World Bank , which cites data from the Inter-Parliamentary Union, the 19 percent figure is right on for 2015. The U.S. figure has remained at 19 percent in the most recent Inter-Parliamentary Union data , which is current through June 2016.\n",
      "Specifically, in 2016, there are 104 women serving in both chambers of Congress, comprising 19.4 percent of the 535 combined members. (In all, 76 are Democrats and 28 are Republicans.)  Chamber by chamber, 20 women serve in the Senate, accounting for 20 percent of all members in the chamber, and 84 women serve in the House, accounting for 19.3 percent.\n",
      "Is 19 percent the highest in United States history?\n",
      "As it turns out, Kaine is correct on that point, too, as the following chart from the Congressional Research Service shows.\n",
      "\"It's pretty straightforward,\" said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University’s Eagleton Institute of Politics. \"It's a record high, but it's quite low.\"\n",
      "If anything, Kaine underplayed the United States’ deficit compared to the rest of the world. The U.S. rank has bounced around a bit over the past year, but it places 96th in the most recent Inter-Parliamentary Union rankings, among 191 countries for which there is data. That’s even worse than the 75th-place finish Kaine cited.\n",
      "By comparison, the other countries Kaine mentioned did better, though hardly close to male-female parity. Iraq had 27 percent female legislators (58th in the most recent rankings), Afghanistan had 29 percent (ranking 50th) and Rwanda was indeed No. 1 in the world with 64 percent.\"In Congress right now, we're doing the best job we have ever done in women in the federal legislature,\" but it’s still only \"19 percent.\"\n",

      "About 1.3 million Americans rang in 2014 with a loss of long-term unemployment benefits , due to Congress’ failure to renew the Emergency Unemployment Compensation program before its Dec. 28 expiration.\n",
      "Gene Sperling, a top economic adviser to President Barack Obama and director of the National Economic Council, is pushing Congress to extend the benefits. The Senate passed a key procedural hurdle Tuesday, but the House is not considered likely to follow suit.\n",
      "To receive the benefits, the law requires that people actively look for jobs. On CNN’s State of the Union, Candy Crowley suggested that some people may be able to game the system. Sperling pushed back against that idea, emphasizing that a large majority of the unemployed are honestly trying to find jobs in a tough economy.\n",
      "\"Most of the people are desperately looking for jobs,\" he said. \"You know, our economy still has three people looking for every job (opening).\"\n",
      "We thought we’d check whether Sperling’s ratio of people to job openings is on target.\n",
      "To check the 3-to-1 ratio, we needed to know two things: the number of available jobs and the number of unemployed Americans. A White House spokesman referred us to a couple of Bureau of Labor Statistics reports.\n",
      "There were 3.925 million job openings in October, according to the BLS Job Openings and Labor Turnover report from Dec. 10.\n",
      "For an apples-to-apples comparison, we’ll use October unemployment numbers the BLS released in their Nov. 8 report, even though they’ve since published November data. They said 11.3 million people were unemployed. That just counts people who are actively looking for work, not those who have stopped looking due to discouragement or retirement.\n",
      "That’s a ratio of 2.88-to-1 or, once you round off, roughly 3-to-1, just as Sperling said.\n",
      "We should note a few caveats, though.\n",
      "Tara Sinclair, George Washington University economics professor, pointed out that Sperling’s ratio isn’t perfect.\n",
      "\"The numbers that Sperling reported are about correct, but there is actually a lot more competition for jobs than that because many employed people are also applying for the same jobs that the unemployed are applying for,\" she said.\n",
      "On the other hand, it’s worth noting that Sperling’s claim implies that for each job opening, there are three qualified applicants employers can choose from, but that’s a generous assumption.\n",
      "\"So it is possible for there to be a relatively high number of applicants for a job but employers may still feel like it is hard to hire because the people applying don't have the skills they are looking for,\" Sinclair said. \"Or people may not apply to the jobs that are out there because they are not a good fit for any number of reasons.\"\n",
      "James Sherk, a senior policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said Sperling’s statistic is good for comparing change over time. For example, Sherk said, the economy is worse now than it was in 2006, though the ratio has been improving steadily as of late.\n",
      "Also worth noting is that many employers fill vacancies without publicizing them. According to one report, employers with no recorded vacancies at the end of a month account for 42 percent of hires in the next month.\n",
      "That means the number of job openings the BLS survey records will always understate the actual number of openings.\"Our economy still has three people looking for every job (opening).\"\n",

      "\"We believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our planet,\" he said during his Jan. 20 address. \"And today, America is number one in oil and gas. America is number one in wind power. Every three weeks, we bring online as much solar power as we did in all of 2008.\"\n",
      "We decided to check out the data and see if in fact the United States is the world’s top oil and gas producer. As it turns out, the United States passed Saudi Arabia about two years ago in terms of oil production. And we’ve been the top producer of natural gas for more than two decades.\n",
      "The U.S. Energy Information Administration , which tracks global energy production and consumption statistics, generally uses total oil supply production as its most relevant statistic for assessing the world oil market. This statistic includes crude oil, natural gas liquids, condensates, other liquids, such as biofuels like ethanol, and refinery gain.\n",
      "By this measure, in the third quarter of 2014 -- which includes the most recent available data -- the United States produced 14.2 million barrels per day. The next-highest producer, Saudi Arabia, produced 11.7 million per day; and Russia produced 10.5 million per day. Together, that’s about 40 percent of total global production.\n",
      "If we whittle down that number further just to look at crude oil -- what typically comes to mind when we think of \"oil production\" -- with no other liquids, the United States is third behind Saudi Arabia and Russia. But when natural gas liquids are added into the mix, the United States takes the No. 1 spot again with 12.9 million barrels per day of crude oil and natural gas liquids.\n",
      "A note: Natural gas liquids -- included in the oil production count -- are different from natural gas. Natural gas liquids are derivatives of petroleum (like kerosene) that are found in the same rocks as a natural gas deposit. Natural gas is methane that comes from the ground as a gas. It’s the gas that comes out of a gas stove and heats buildings.\n",
      "The United States produces significantly more natural gas than Saudi Arabia and a bit more than Russia. According to the Energy Information Administration, United States energy production is about evenly split between petroleum and natural gas. Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, primarily produces petroleum.\n",

      "In his address to a joint session of Congress, President Barack Obama brought up the most explosive charge to emerge in the health care debate: the specter of \"death panels.\"\n",
      "\"Some of people’s concerns (about the health care legislation) have grown out of bogus claims spread by those whose only agenda is to kill reform at any cost,\" Obama told lawmakers and a national television audience on Sept. 9, 2009. \"The best example is the claim, made not just by radio and cable talk show hosts, but by prominent politicians, that we plan to set up panels of bureaucrats with the power to kill off senior citizens. Now, such a charge would be laughable if it weren’t so cynical and irresponsible. It is a lie, plain and simple.\"\n",

      "\"And who will suffer the most when they ration care?\" Palin wrote. \"The sick, the elderly, and the disabled, of course. The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama's 'death panel' so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their 'level of productivity in society,' whether they are worthy of health care. Such a system is downright evil.\"\n",
      "We have read all 1000-plus pages of the Democratic bill and examined versions in various committees. There is no panel in any version of the health care bills in Congress that judges a person's \"level of productivity in society\" to determine whether someone is \"worthy\" of health care. When we first assessed Palin's claim on Aug. 7, 2009, we gave it our lowest rating — Pants on Fire.\n",
      "Palin may have jumped to a conclusion about the Obama administration's efforts to promote comparative effectiveness research. Such research has nothing to do with evaluating patients for \"worthiness.\" Rather, comparative effectiveness research finds out which treatments work better than others.\n",
      "The health reform bill being considered in the House of Representatives says that a Comparative Effectiveness Research Center shall \"conduct, support, and synthesize research\" that looks at \"outcomes, effectiveness, and appropriateness of health care services and procedures in order to identify the manner in which diseases, disorders, and other health conditions can most effectively and appropriately be prevented, diagnosed, treated, and managed clinically.\"\n",
      "The idea here, which Obama and his budget director Peter Orszag have discussed many times, is to make it easier for doctors, health care workers, insurance companies and patients to find out which treatments are the most effective, as determined by clinical studies and other research.\n",
      "The House bill states in the section creating the Comparative Effectiveness Research Center and an oversight commission that \"nothing in this section shall be construed to permit the Commission or the Center to mandate coverage, reimbursement, or other policies for any public or private payer.\" In other words, comparative effectiveness research will tell you whether treatment A is better than treatment B. But the bill as written won't mandate which treatment doctors and patients have to select.\n",
      "Nothing has emerged to suggest to us that the death panels claim is any more true today than it was when Palin first floated it. We still rate it as Pants on Fire today.

      "That year, Moore wrote an op-ed for the website WorldNetDaily.com. Keith Ellison from Minnesota had become the first Muslim to win a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. Moore said Ellison’s faith had no place in the government of the United States because the \"Islamic philosophy (is) directly contrary to the principles of the Constitution.\"\n",
      "\"The Islamic faith rejects our God and believes that the state must mandate the worship of its own god, Allah,\" Moore wrote Dec. 13, 2006 . \"Common sense alone dictates that in the midst of a war with Islamic terrorists we should not place someone in a position of great power who shares their doctrine. In 1943, we would never have allowed a member of Congress to take their oath on ‘Mein Kampf,’ or someone in the 1950s to swear allegiance to the ‘Communist Manifesto.’ Congress has the authority and should act to prohibit Ellison from taking the congressional oath today!\"\n",

      "The words change to \"No To Drilling Offshore Oil\" while Obama is heard saying, \"Offshore drilling would not lower gas prices today.\"\n",
      "The screen says, \"No To A Gas Tax Holiday\" while Obama says, \"I think John McCain's proposal for a three-month tax holiday is a bad idea.\"\n",
      "\"No To Innovation. No To The Electric Car\" appears on the screen while Obama says \"In this campaign, John McCain is offering the same old gimmicks.\"\n",
      "\"No To Clean, Safe, Nuclear Energy\" while Obama says \"I start off with the premise that nuclear energy is not optimal. I am not a nuclear energy proponent.\" The ad ends with the message: \"Barack Obama Truly Is The Dr. No Of Energy Security.\"\n",
      "The ad is part of an effort by the McCain campaign to portray Obama as an obstructionist on energy policy. We were surprised to find the ad had a split personality. The drilling and gas tax claims were accurate, as we'll explain below. But we found McCain was Pants-on-Fire wrong with his claims about Obama's positions on innovation, the car and nuclear power.\n",
      "The drilling claim refers to Obama's response after McCain suggested on June 16, 2008, that states be given authority to decide whether to permit offshore drilling. Indeed, that day Obama's campaign said he was opposed, and on June 20 the candidate reiterated his opposition during a stop in Jacksonville, Fla.\n",
      "\"I will keep the moratorium in place and prevent oil companies from drilling off Florida's coasts,\" Obama said in his prepared remarks for that appearance. He also said McCain was misleading voters by suggesting more drilling would lower gas prices, because it would take many years before a significant amount of oil was produced.\n",
      "The ad's claim about the gas tax holiday refers to Obama's response to another McCain proposal, to eliminate the federal tax on gasoline between Memorial Day and Labor Day. Obama has repeatedly said he opposes the idea because oil companies would not pass along the savings and, even if they did, it would provide relatively little help to consumers. (We checked Obama's claim that it would save a typical motorist about 30 cents a day and found it Mostly True. )\n",
      "So on these points, McCain's right. Obama is opposed to changing the rules on offshore drilling and suspending the gas tax. McCain gets a True.Says Obama opposes offshore drilling and a gas tax holiday.\n",

      "Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump wasted no time punching back the day after Hillary Clinton listed in detail why he could not be trusted to run the economy.\n",
      "Clinton \"is a world-class liar,\" Trump said in a June 22, 2016, speech in New York. \"Just look at her pathetic email and server statements, or her phony landing in Bosnia where she said she was under attack and the attack turned out to be young girls handing her flowers.\"\n",
      "On that Bosnia trip, Trump picked one of Clinton’s most prominent transgressions. When she made that claim, we rated it Pants on Fire in 2008 . Here’s why.\n",
      "During an introduction to a foreign policy speech on Iraq on March 17, 2008, then-Sen. Hillary Clinton reminisced about her days as first lady and a trip to Tuzla, Bosnia, she made in March 1996.\n",
      "\"I remember landing under sniper fire. There was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport, but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles to get to our base.\"\n",
      "But that's not what happened, as demonstrated by CBS News video that shows Clinton arriving on the tarmac under no visible duress, and greeting a child who offers her a copy of a poem. The Washington Post  Fact Checke r also turned a skeptical eye on Clinton's comments, reporting that a review of more than 100 news stories from the time documented no security threats to the First Lady.\n",
      "CBS reporter Sharyl Attkisson, who covered Clinton on the Bosnia visit, wrote of her memories of the trip : \"To be sure, it was not the 'safest' trip for a first lady to take: there were serious risks in traveling to Bosnia, even for the president's wife under the vigilant protection of the U.S. military. It took some guts for her to go. But I don't recall, and did not note, any close calls on this trip with sniper fire or any other dangers. \"\n",
      "Immediately after the speech that day, a reporter asked Clinton about remarks from others on the trip who suggested the trip was for photo opportunities rather than foreign policy and she stood by her account of sniper fire. \"There was no greeting ceremony, and we basically were told to run to our cars. Now, that is what happened,\" she said.\n",
      "But she retracted the remarks a week later, telling the Philadelphia Daily News editorial board on March 24, 2008, that she \"misspoke,\" correcting herself to say she had been told there was a threat of sniper fire in the area. The next day she told reporters, \"So I made a mistake. That happens. It shows I'm human, which for some people is a revelation.\"\n",
      "On the campaign trail, Clinton has discussed the danger of the trip before and how it gave her important foreign policy experience. The Des Moines Register reported her saying on Dec. 30, 2007, \"We landed in one of those corkscrew landings and ran out because they said there might be sniper fire. I don't remember anyone offering me tea on the tarmac there.\"\n",
      "Interestingly, Clinton's memoir Living History depicts an arrival that, though dangerous, included neither actual sniper fire nor running. It matches the CBS footage and appears to contradict Clinton's later retelling:\n",
      "\"Security conditions were constantly changing in the former Yugoslavia, and they had recently deteriorated again. Due to reports of snipers in the hills around the airstrip, we were forced to cut short an event on the tarmac with local children, though we did have time to meet them and their teachers and to learn how hard they had worked during the war to continue classes in any safe spot they could find. One eight-year-old girl gave me a copy of a poem she had written entitled 'Peace.' \"\n",
      "There's no doubt flying into Bosnia was dangerous back in 1996, but the threat of sniper fire is not the same as actual sniper fire, and hustling off the tarmac is not the same as running with your head down. And there was a welcoming ceremony where a young girl gave her a poem.Says Hillary Clinton \"said she was under attack (in Bosnia) but the attack turned out to be young girls handing her flowers.\"\n",

      "\"It begins: California appoints first illegal alien to state office -- Trump has a better plan,\" said a May 10 headline on The Breaking Dawn .\n",
      "Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. You can read more about our partnership with Facebook here .\n",
      "While the story itself has some accurate information, the headline is misleading.\n",
      "An undocumented immigrant, Lizbeth Mateo, did receive an official appointment by the state of California. But the headline creates a misleading impression by omitting key information about the nature of her post.\n",
      "She is serving in an unpaid position on a 12-member advisory committee, and she wasn’t the first undocumented immigrant to get such an appointment.\n",
      "Mateo, a 33-year-old Los Angeles attorney, is a well-known immigrant activist . In 2013, she participated in a group called the Dream 9 , comprised of undocumented immigrants from Mexico who were raised in the United States. The group left for Mexico and then tried to re-enter the United States by seeking asylum as a protest. Mateo was held at a detention center in Arizona before she was released.\n",
      "We found no contact information on the website of The Breaking Dawn, a site that is supportive of President Donald Trump and includes several stories raising alarm about \"illegal aliens.\"\n",
      "Mateo’s appointment\n",
      "In March, the California Senate Rules Committee appointed Mateo to the California Student Opportunity and Access Program Project Grant Advisory Committee, known as Cal SOAP .\n",
      "The committee advises the California Student Aid Commission on efforts to increase college access for poor students.\n",
      "Mateo didn’t respond to an email and message from PolitiFact, but she told the media in a March statement that \"while undocumented students have become more visible in our state, they remain underrepresented in places where decisions that affect them are being made.\"\n",
      "Appointees serve at the pleasure of the Senate Rules Committee, so she will serve until she is replaced or steps down, said Dan Reeves, chief of staff to Senate President pro Tempore Kevin de León.\n",
      "Mateo was appointed one day after Trump visited California and slammed the state’s sanctuary policies.\n",
      "The Sacramento Bee reported that Mateo was born in Oaxaca, Mexico, and came to the United States with her parents when she was 14. She graduated from Santa Clara University School of Law in 2016 and passed the California bar exam the next year. (Undocumented immigrants are allowed to apply for the bar in California .)\n",
      "The Senate initially announced that the appointment was a first for the state, but Senate officials later clarified that, in 2016, Gov. Jerry Brown named a student in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program to the California State University Board of Trustees.\n",
      "Reeves said that he believes Mateo is the first undocumented immigrant not protected by DACA to receive a statewide appointment.\n",
      "Mateo told NPR that when she applied for DACA, the Obama administration wanted her to explain why she left the country during the Dream 9 protest. She said the administration denied her DACA application.\n",
      "Some California lawmakers want to increase civic participation of undocumented immigrants. If it passes, SB 174 would allow for all California residents, including undocumented immigrants, to receive appointments to state and local boards and commissions that are not merely advisory.  Mateo was appointed to an advisory committee, so SB 174 would not affect that appointment, said Michael Soller, spokesman for state Sen. Ricardo Lara, a sponsor of the bill.\"It begins: California appoints first illegal alien to state office.\"\n",

      "In his book Courage to Stand, former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, a potential GOP presidential candidate, said President Barack Obama \"needs to do a more forceful job of reminding people about the threat of global terrorism.\"\n",
      "And that needs to start with calling it by its real name, Pawlenty wrote.\n",
      "\"Sadly, President Obama will not call this effort what it is,\" Pawlenty wrote. \"He has stopped using the phrase 'war on terror.' His administration never makes pointed references -- or any references -- to the real problem: radical Islamic terrorism. Apparently that isn't politically correct. The fact is, radical Islamic terrorism exists. Pointing that out doesn't condemn all Muslims. But there is an element of Islam that is radical and that has terrorist intentions. We need to call it what it is. We need to confront it, and we need to defeat it.\"\n",
      "This isn't the first time Obama has been accused of ducking the phrase \"war on terror\" or for not attaching the words Islamic or Muslim when talking about violent extremists.\n",
      "Back in November 2009, we checked into a similar claim from Fox News' Sean Hannity that \"Barack Obama won't even use the term 'war on terrorism.' \"\n",
      "Back then, we did a word search of Obama's public statements and could not find that Obama has used the phrase \"war on terrorism\" as president, though he said it numerous times as a candidate. Early in his presidency, Obama used the phrase \"war on terror,\" but only a couple of times.\n",
      "And it's true that Obama made a conscious and deliberate decision early in his presidency to avoid the phrase \"war on terror\" in favor of more precise language.\n",
      "Obama explained his reasoning in several interviews.\n",
      "During a Jan. 27, 2009, interview with Obama, Hisham Melhem of Arabic-language television news station al-Aribiya noted that Obama seemed to eschew President George W. Bush's phrase \"war on terror\" and \"frame it in a different way, specifically against one group called al-Qaida and their collaborators.\"\n",
      "Said Obama: \"I think that you're making a very important point. And that is that the language we use matters. And what we need to understand is, is that there are extremist organizations -- whether Muslim or any other faith in the past -- that will use faith as a justification for violence. We cannot paint with a broad brush a faith as a consequence of the violence that is done in that faith's name.\n",
      "\"And so you will, I think, see our administration be very clear in distinguishing between organizations like al-Qaida -- that espouse violence, espouse terror and act on it -- and people who may disagree with my administration and certain actions, or may have a particular viewpoint in terms of how their countries should develop. We can have legitimate disagreements but still be respectful. I cannot respect terrorist organizations that would kill innocent civilians, and we will hunt them down.\n",
      "\"But to the broader Muslim world what we are going to be offering is a hand of friendship.\"\n",
      "The issue was again raised in a Feb. 3, 2009, interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper:\n",
      "Cooper: \"I've noticed you don't use the term 'war on terror.' I think I read an article that you've only used it once since inauguration. Is that conscious? Is there something about that term you find objectionable or not useful?\"\n",
      "Obama: \"Well, you know, I think it is very important for us to recognize that we have a battle or a war against some terrorist organizations. But that those organizations aren't representative of a broader Arab community, Muslim community. ... You know, words matter in this situation because one of the ways we're going to win this struggle is through the battle of hearts and minds.\"\n",
      "Cooper: \"So that's not a term you're going to be using much in the future?\"\n",
      "Obama: \"You know, what I want to do is make sure that I'm constantly talking about al-Qaida and other affiliated organizations because we, I believe, can win over moderate Muslims to recognize that that kind of destruction and nihilism ultimately leads to a dead end, and that we should be working together to make sure that everybody has got a better life.\n",
      "Based on those facts, we rated Hannity's claim True. But when former Vice president Dick Cheney took the meme a step further and alleged that Obama will not \"admit we're at war,\" we rated Cheney's claim Pants in Fire .\n",
      "Here, Pawlenty's claim is closer to Hannity's. So first we checked Obama's public statements since our previous fact-check to see if he has stuck to this line and avoided the phrase \"war on terror\" or anything like \"radical Islamic terrorism.\" And he has.\n",
      "In May 2010, John Brennan, assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism, addressed the topic in some detail:\n",
      "\"The president’s strategy is absolutely clear about the threat we face,\" Brennan said in an address at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"Our enemy is not 'terrorism' because terrorism is but a tactic.  Our enemy is not 'terror' because terror is a state of mind, and as Americans we refuse to live in fear.  Nor do we describe our enemy as 'jihadists' or 'Islamists' because jihad is a holy struggle, a legitimate tenant of Islam, meaning to purify oneself or one’s community, and there is nothing holy or legitimate or Islamic about murdering innocent men, women and children.\n",
      "\"Indeed, characterizing our adversaries this way would actually be counterproductive. It would play into the false perception that they are religious leaders defending a holy cause, when in fact they are nothing more than murderers, including the murder of thousands upon thousands of Muslims.\"\n",
      "\"Moreover,\" Brennan said, \"describing our enemy in religious terms would lend credence to the lie—propagated by al-Qaida and its affiliates to justify terrorism—that the United States is somehow at war against Islam. The reality, of course, is that we never have been and will never be at war with Islam. After all, Islam, like so many faiths, is part of America.\n",
      "\"Instead, the president’s strategy is clear and precise. Our enemy is al-Qaida and its terrorist affiliates. For it was al-Qaida who attacked us so viciously on 9/11 and whose desire to attack the United States, our allies, and our partners remains undiminished. And it is its affiliates who have taken up al-Qaida’s call to arms against the United States in other parts of the world.\n",
      "\"The president’s strategy is unequivocal with regard to our posture. The United States of America is at war. We are at war against al-Qaida and its terrorist affiliates. That is why the president is responsibly ending the war in Iraq, which had nothing to do with 9/11, and why he has refocused our efforts on Afghanistan, where al-Qaida continues to plot from the tribal regions along the border with Pakistan and inside of Pakistan.\"\n",
      "More recently, in remarks at the Adams Center, a nonprofit that runs community centers and mosques, on March 6, 2011, Denis McDonough, deputy national security adviser to the president, spoke about the strategy of the Obama administration's words.\n",
      "\"President Obama recognizes that through our words and deeds we can either play into al-Qaida’s narrative and messaging, or we can challenge it and thereby undermine it,\" McDonough said. \"We’re determined to undermine it.\"\n",
      "In his book, Pawlenty claims Obama has stopped using the phrase \"war on terror\" and his administration \"never makes pointed references -- or any references -- to the real problem: radical Islamic terrorism.\" We found several instances in which Vice President Joe Biden has talked about \"radical extremism\" or \"radical fundamentalism\" and the need to aggressively confront \"violent extremism and radical ideologies.\" But he never attaches the words \"Islamic\" to those phrases. And neither has Obama. As Obama and members of his administration have repeatedly explained, this is a very conscious decision to be more precise about the enemy, al-Qaida and other terrorist affiliates and not to feed into the al-Qaida message that America is somehow at war with Islam. You may agree or disagree with Obama's word choices, or with Pawlenty's, but Pawlenty is correct about Obama's deliberate decision not to use the phrases \"war on terror\" or \"radical Islamic terrorism.President Obama has \"stopped using the phrase 'war on terror.' \"\n",

      "Here’s a summary of the case, according to the federal criminal complaint filed Oct. 31.\n",
      "Nucera frequently used racial epithets against African-Americans and called for violence against them.\n",
      "In or about November 2015, when Nucera suspected that a previously arrested African- American individual had slashed the tires of a police vehicle, Nucera stated to a subordinate officer:\n",
      "\"I wish that n----- would come back from Trenton and give me a reason to put my hands on him, I'm tired of them. These n------ are like ISIS, they have no value. They should line them all up and mow them down. I'd like to be on the firing squad, I could do it. I used to think about if I could shoot someone or not, I could do it, I'm tired of it.\"\n",
      "The incident that led to the charges occurred Sept. 1, 2016, when the Ramada Hotel called to report to police that two individuals had failed to pay for a hotel room the night before and had been swimming in the hotel pool that afternoon. The suspects, both African-Americans, were an 18-year-old man and a 16-year-old woman.\n",
      "The suspects resisted arrest, and one of the officers used pepper spray, but the suspects were ultimately subdued and handcuffed.\n",
      "While the male suspect was no longer resisting, Nucera grabbed his head and slammed it into a metal doorjamb. Nucera also used his arm to strike the suspect’s neck or head.\n",
      "Within hours of the alleged assault, a police officer recorded Nucera making racially hostile statements regarding the suspects and African-Americans in general.\n",
      "Nucera retired as chief shortly after the federal government informed the New Jersey attorney general of the pending investigation.\n",
      "Nucera appeared in court in November 2017. A federal grand jury indicted Nucera on Dec. 7 for allegedly violating a man’s civil rights by using excessive force during an arrest.\n",
      "We contacted Nucera’s lawyer and did not get a reply. In a Dec. 22, 2016 interview with FBI agents, Nucera denied touching the male suspect, according to the indictment.\n",

      "People who don't get insurance through work or other groups will go to the health care exchange; it's designed to help people who have to go off on their own to buy health insurance, and for small businesses with few employees.

      "\"Sarah Palin and Craig Huey. Which would ban a woman's right to choose in every case? Both Palin and Huey,\" the narrator begins.\n",

      "\"USDA approves slaughterhouses producing horse meat for human consumption,\" read the headline on Newstarget, a website providing information for \"educational and entertainment purposes.\"\n",
      "Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes.\n",
      "Here’s the real story: In 2006 , Congress effectively banned horsemeat by forbidding the U.S. Department of Agriculture to spend money on inspecting slaughterhouses. Meat plants can’t operate without USDA inspection.\n",
      "The last three slaughterhouses in the United States (two in Texas and one in Illinois) closed in 2007, one year after the ban.\n",
      "The ban was part of the annual USDA funding bill and was renewed a year at a time until it expired in 2011.\n",
      "In 2011, Congress lifted the five-year-old ban on funding horse meat inspections in a spending bill that former President Barack Obama signed into law. The bill didn’t allocate any new money for inspections, but activists worried that it might eventually lead to sales of horse meat.\n",
      "The Newstarget story’s origin is likely from an actual 2012 incident when a New Mexico meat plant received federal approval to slaughter horses for meat, which was met with opposition from many animal rights groups.\n",
      "The USDA stated that it was required by law to issue a \"grant of inspection\" to Valley Meat Co. of New Mexico, because it had met all federal requirements.\n",
      "While Valley Meat Co. planned to process horse meat for human consumption in Europe and other export markets, as well as sell it for animal feed at U.S. zoos, there is no evidence that they sold the meat for consumption in the United States.\n",
      "More recently, a bipartisan ban on slaughtering horses for meat has been included in a spending bill that President Donald Trump signed in March of this year.\n",
      "The renewed ban on will continue at least until Oct. 1 when the funding bill expires.\"USDA approves slaughterhouses producing horse meat for human consumption\"\n",

      "A blog post that accused U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters, D.-Calif., of being an absentee congresswoman for decades relied on a fake statistic from a thread on Reddit.\n",
      "\"Democrat Maxine Waters Has Shown Up To Only 10% Of Congressional Meetings For 35 YEARS,\" read the headline on a June 7, 2017, post on TeddyStick.com . Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to combat fake news.\n",
      "The website, which doesn’t list contact information and has hidden its registration data , attacked Waters, an African-American woman, for allegedly inciting racial strife and refusing to do her job.\n",

      "\"Now the demented Democrat is looking even more foolish since an observant Reddit user known as 1tch has taken the time to gather the facts together showing that 'Over Her 35 Years In Congress Maxine Waters Has Missed 90% Of Congressional Meetings.' \"\n",
      "The source is simply a Reddit thread from June 7, 2017 , which contains no evidence at all. It’s just a series of comments posted on Reddit’s \"the_donald\" forum. We contacted a Waters spokesman, who chose not to comment.\n",
      "Waters is a long-serving legislator, but she hasn’t been in Congress for 35 years. She first started representing a California district in 1991, so she’s been in Washington for 26 years. She became a state legislator in 1977 and served until joining the U.S. House of Representatives, which amounts to 40 years of lawmaking experience.\n",
      "Beyond that, it’s wrong to say Waters missed 90 percent of her \"congressional meetings,\" even though exactly how those those meetings are defined isn’t specified.\n",
      "It’s possible the post referred to her voting record, but that would be way off. As a commenter on the Reddit thread noted, GovTrack.us notes Waters has missed 7.6 percent of her votes since January 1991. That’s higher than the 2.2 percent average among all House members, but nowhere near a 90 percent absentee rate.\n",
      "The statistic also could mean all her committee meetings, but that isn’t right, either. Of course, no member of Congress attends every single hearing, but the Washington Examiner did analyze meeting records for members of Congress in 2014.\n",
      "Waters was not among the 20 highest absentee rates, which was comprised of 12 Republicans and eight Democrats. U.S. Rep. Niki Tsongas, D-Mass., came in first, missing 96 percent of hearings in the Examiner’s analysis.\n",
      "We spot-checked Waters’ 2015-16 record as ranking member of the House Committee on Financial Services, which also gives her ex officio status on a half-dozen subcommittees, meaning Waters could attend meetings for those subcommittees if she chose. By our count, Waters missed 37 percent of the hearings listed on the Government Publishing Office’s website.\n",
      "There’s no evidence Waters attended a paltry 10 percent of meetings, however you count them. TeddyStick.com used a dubious source that appeared to have just made up the stat.\"Democrat Maxine Waters has shown up to only 10 percent of congressional meetings for 35 years.\"\n",

      "\"WaPo reporter who broke news on Judge Roy Moore story has a criminal history of ‘faking,’ \" read the headline on 100percentfedup.com.\n",
      "The headline on the story might make you think the reporter, Stephanie McCrummen, has a past of \"faking\" her news stories. But the details in the post aren’t related to journalism: They highlight McCrummen’s \"public criminal records in multiple states stretching across four time zones,\" including writing a \"fake check.\"\n",

      "McCrummen was an undergraduate student at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, in 1992 when she wrote a $6.93 check that bounced.\n",
      "\"That was a bounced check was for groceries while Stephanie was in college, which she paid back,\" said Kristine Coratti, vice president of communications at the Washington Post, in response to our email inquiry to McCrummen.\n",
      "McCrummen pleaded guilty to the criminal misdemeanor charge, appeared before a magistrate and paid it off, alongside a $50 fee, according to James Stanford, the Orange County Superior Court clerk.\n",
      "Traffic violations\n",
      "The blogpost then pivots to McCrummen’s traffic offenses, the first of which was for speeding in Scottsdale, Ariz.\n",
      "\"In 2010, she was tracked down by the courts after she had escaped Arizona’s jurisdiction to D.C., and her case was assigned to the Fines/Fees and Restitution Enforcement (FARE) Program established to collect delinquent court ordered restitution, fines, fees, and surcharges,\" the post reads. \"After the FARE team tracked her down at her Washington D.C. apartment, they finally appeared to get her attention and on October 23, 2010 she paid the defaulted fine to the criminal court, almost two months after her conviction.\"\n",
      "Traffic offenses can be criminal if the driver is found driving without a license or the excessive speed was not prudent for the conditions. But the court authorities doubt this was the case.\n",
      "\"If it was criminal it would probably still be in the records because those are retained longer than civil traffic case, but we just can’t know for sure,\" said Jennifer Ilten, executive secretary at the Scottsdale city court.\n",
      "Heather Murphy, communications director at the Arizona Supreme Court, said the court where the fine was paid wasn’t a \"criminal court,\" but rather, municipal.\n",

      "\"The fine is fairly typical of a civil traffic violation for speeding or another moving violation, but I cannot state that as fact,\" Murphy said. \"This is not driving without a license or DUI – those fines begin in excess of $1000.\n",
      "\"Even knowing the fare amount, a big chunk of that could have been the collection fees,\" Ilten said. \"It was probably a lesser charge.\"\n",
      "Murphy also explained that FARE enforcement is much less sinister than the post made it sound. It usually occurs when a person doesn’t receive a citation because it went to an old address. A new citation is mailed to the new address when discovered. In this case, the ticket was entered for collection on Oct. 4, 2010, and paid in full on Oct. 23, 2010.\n",
      "The other two traffic tickets both occurred in Virginia and had been wiped from the courts. In Fairfax County, the post reported McCrummen failed to obey a highway sign -- an infraction, not a criminal offense. The same goes for Prince William County; the post said McCrummen drove at 46 miles an hour in a 25 mile per hour speed zone. That’s also not a criminal offense.\n",
